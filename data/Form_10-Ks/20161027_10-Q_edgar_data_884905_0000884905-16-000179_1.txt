  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Presentation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     -   In the opinion of Praxair, Inc. (Praxair) management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair, Inc. and subsidiaries in Praxair s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the company s significant accounting policies during   2016  . 
  Accounting Standards Implemented in   2016    
             
    Accounting for Share-based Compensation   -  In June 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on the  accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
                
    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting -   In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the accounting for employee share-based payments.  The new guidance, among other changes, requires that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards be recorded in Income taxes in the statement of income in the period in which they occur, and within operating cash flows. Previously, such excess tax benefits were recorded as direct credits to equity (not via the statement of income), and as financing cash flows.  
     Effective in the second quarter 2016, Praxair elected to adopt the requirements of this new accounting standard.  Accordingly, income tax expense for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and operating cash flows for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include   $5 million   and   $15 million   of excess tax benefits, respectively. For this change relating to excess tax benefits, Praxair did not adjust the 2016 first-quarter amounts because the impact was not material, and the Company elected not to adjust prior-year cash flow presentations. 
  The new standard also amends the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows by requiring that cash paid to taxing authorities at settlement arising from the withholding of shares from employees be classified in cash flows from financing activities (such amounts were previously included in cash flows from operating activities).  This portion of the standard was required to be adopted on a retrospective basis. Accordingly,   $6 million   of such cash paid to taxing authorities during the first quarter 2016 was reclassified from operating to financing cash flows, and   $13 million   was similarly reclassified for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Accounting Standards to be Implemented 
             
    Revenue Recognition     In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on the reporting and disclosure of revenue. The new guidance requires the evaluation of contracts with customers to determine the recognition of revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation, and would require expanded disclosures. Subsequently, the FASB has issued amendments to certain aspects of the guidance including the effective date. This guidance is required to be effective beginning in the first quarter 2018 (with early adoption beginning in 2017 optional) and includes several transition options. Praxair is currently in the process of reviewing the new guidance and will provide updates on the expected impact to Praxair in future filings, as determined. 
                
    Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory     In July 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the measurement of inventory.  The new guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Currently inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market.  This new guidance will be effective for Praxair beginning in the first quarter 2017 on a prospective basis, with early adoption optional.  Praxair does not expect this requirement to have a material impact. 
                
    Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   - In November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. Currently deferred income tax liabilities and assets are required to be separated and classified as current or non-current in a classified balance sheet. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. This new guidance will be effective for Praxair beginning in the first quarter 2017, with early adoption  
     
   10 

     Table of Contents  

optional. The new guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Praxair does not expect this requirement to have a material impact. 
             
    Leases     In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the accounting and financial statement presentation of leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases, except those that meet certain scope exceptions, and would require expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This guidance will be effective for Praxair beginning in the first quarter 2019, with early adoption optional, and requires companies to transition using a modified retrospective approach. Praxair is in the early stages of reviewing the new guidance and will provide updates on the expected impact to Praxair in future filings, as determined.  
                
    Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments     In August 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows.  The update provides accounting guidance for specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice.  This new guidance will be effective for Praxair beginning in the first quarter 2018 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption optional. Praxair does not expect this requirement to have a material impact. 
       
  Reclassifications     Certain prior years  amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation, including reclassifications to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows due to the adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard.  
   
  2. 2016 and 2015 Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges 
    
  2016 Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges 
  In the third quarter of 2016, Praxair recorded pre-tax charges totaling   $96 million   (  $63 million   after-tax and noncontrolling interests or   $0.22   per diluted share). Following is a summary of the pre-tax charge by reportable segment:  

The severance costs of   $40 million   are for the elimination of   730   positions. The other charges of   $56 million   are primarily related to (i) the consolidation of operations for efficiencies and cost reduction primarily in North America and Surface Technologies, (ii) integration costs for recent acquisitions in Europe and North America, and (iii) asset write-downs and other charges related to the impacts of weaker underlying industrial activity, primarily in the Americas and Asia. Amounts related to asset write-downs are net of expected sale proceeds, which are not significant.  
  The total cash requirement of the cost reduction program and other charges are estimated to be approximately   $57 million  , of which   $3 million   was paid through September 30, 2016. 
    
  2016 Pension Settlement Charge 
  In 2015 a number of senior managers retired. These retirees are covered by the U.S. supplemental pension plan which provides for a lump sum benefit payment option. Under certain circumstances, such lump sum payments must be accounted for as a settlement of the related pension obligation, but only when paid. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2016, Praxair recorded a pension settlement charge related to net unrecognized actuarial losses of   $4 million   (  $3 million   after-tax or   $0.01   per diluted share).

     Table of Contents  

2015 Charges 
  In the second quarter of 2015, Praxair recorded pre-tax charges totaling   $146 million   (  $112 million   after-tax and noncontrolling interests, or   $0.39   per diluted share) and in the third quarter recorded pre-tax charges totaling   $26 million  , including   $19 million   for a cost reduction program and   $7 million   for a pension settlement charge (  $18 million   after-tax or   $0.06   per diluted share). For further details regarding the cost reduction program and other charges, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
    
  Reconciliation 
    
  The following table summarizes the activities related to the company's cost reduction and other charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Classification in the condensed consolidated financial statements 
  The pre-tax charges for each year are shown within operating profit in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income. In the condensed consolidated balance sheets, reductions in assets are recorded against the carrying value of the related assets and unpaid amounts are recorded primarily as short-term liabilities. On the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, the pre-tax impact of these charges, net of cash payments, is shown as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. In Note 13 -   Segments  , Praxair excluded these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit; a reconciliation of segments operating profit to consolidated operating profit is shown within the segment operating profit table.  
   
  3. Acquisitions 
  2016 Acquisitions 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Praxair had acquisitions totaling   $345 million  , primarily the acquisition of  Yara International ASA's European carbon dioxide business ("European CO2 business") and packaged gases businesses in North America and Europe. These transactions resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets of   $129 million   and   $71 million  , respectively (see Note 9).  In addition, Praxair purchased a remaining   34%   share in a Scandinavian joint venture for   $104 million   (see Note 14). 
    
  European CO2 Acquisition 
    
  On June 1, 2016 Praxair, Inc. completed an acquisition of a European CO2 business, which is a leading supplier of liquid CO2 and dry ice primarily to the European food and beverage industries.  The business operates CO2 liquefaction plants and dry ice production facilities across the UK, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy.   This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination; accordingly, the results of operations were consolidated from June 1, 2016 in the European business segment. 
    
  The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately   $230 million   (   206 million  ) and resulted in   $126 million   of intangible assets.   The intangible assets primarily consist of   $69 million   of Goodwill and   $53 million   of customer relationships that will be amortized over their estimated useful life of   20   years. The allocation of the purchase price is based on preliminary estimates and assumptions, which are subject to revision based on final information received, including appraisals and other analysis that support underlying estimates. Currently, any potential adjustments are not expected to be material.

2015 Acquisitions 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , Praxair had acquisitions totaling   $43 million  , primarily acquisitions of packaged gases businesses in North and South America.  These transactions resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets of   $28 million   and   $10 million  , respectively.  

4. Supplemental Information 
  Inventories 
  The following is a summary of Praxair s consolidated inventories: 

Long-term receivables 
  Long-term receivables are not material and are largely reserved. Such long-term receivables are included within other long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $39 million   and   $33 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These amounts are net of reserves of   $49 million   and   $35 million  , respectively. The amounts in both periods relate primarily to government receivables in Brazil and other long-term notes receivable from customers. Collectability is reviewed regularly and uncollectible amounts are written off as appropriate. The account balance changes during   2016   were primarily due to additional government receivables in Brazil and foreign exchange rate movements.

6. Financial Instruments 
  In its normal operations, Praxair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and to a lesser extent precious metal prices. The objective of financial risk management at Praxair is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Praxair routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments ( derivatives ) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Praxair only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. 
  There are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures,  (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies. 
  When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Praxair designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. 
  Counterparties to Praxair s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better and no collateral is required, and there are no significant risk concentrations. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial. 
  The following table is a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for consolidated subsidiaries: 

(a) 
    Assets are recorded in prepaid and other current assets, and liabilities are recorded in other current liabilities. 
              (b) 
    Assets are recorded in other long term assets  
     Currency Contracts 
  Foreign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. The fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities. Praxair also enters into forward currency contracts, which are designated as hedging  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

instruments, to limit the cash flow exposure on certain foreign-currency denominated intercompany loans. The fair value adjustments on these contracts are recorded to AOCI, with the effective portion immediately reclassified to earnings to offset the fair value adjustments on the underlying debt instrument.  
    
  Net Investment Hedge 
    
  In 2014 Praxair designated the    600 million   ($  669 million   as of   September 30, 2016  )   1.50%   Euro-denominated notes due 2020 and the    500 million   ($  554 million   as of   September 30, 2016  )   1.625%   Euro-denominated notes due 2025, as a hedge of the net investment position in its European operations. In 2016 Praxair designated an incremental    550 million   ($  615 million   as of   September 30, 2016  )   1.20%   Euro-denominated notes due 2024 as an additional hedge of the net investment position in its European operations. These Euro-denominated debt instruments reduce the company's exposure to changes in the currency exchange rate on investments in foreign subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. Since hedge inception, exchange rate movements have reduced long-term debt by $  221 million   (long-term debt increased by   $40 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016), with the offsetting gain shown within the cumulative translation component of AOCI in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  
  Interest Rate Contracts 
  Outstanding Interest Rate Swaps 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Praxair had one outstanding interest rate swap agreement with a   $475 million   notional amount related to the   $475 million     1.25%   notes that mature in 2018. The interest rate swap effectively converts fixed-rate interest to variable-rate interest and is designated as a fair value hedge. Fair value adjustments are recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge / benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying debt instrument. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $8 million   was recognized as an increase in the fair value of these notes (  $6 million   at   December 31, 2015  ). 
    
  Terminated Treasury Rate Locks 
  The following table summarizes the unrecognized gains (losses) related to terminated treasury rate lock contracts: 

(a) 
    The unrecognized gains / (losses) for the treasury rate locks are shown in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and are being recognized on a straight line basis to interest expense   net over the term of the underlying debt agreements. Refer to the table below summarizing the impact on the company s consolidated statements of income and AOCI for current period gain (loss) recognition. 
              (b) 
    The notional amount of the treasury rate lock contracts are equal to the underlying debt instrument with the exception of the treasury rate lock contract entered into to hedge the   $600 million     4.50%   fixed-rate notes that mature in 2019. The notional amount of this contract was   $500 million  .

**The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI within foreign currency translation adjustments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The gains (losses) on treasury rate locks are recorded as a component of AOCI within derivative instruments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There was no ineffectiveness for these instruments during   2016   or   2015  . The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are reclassified to earnings only when the related currency translation adjustments are required to be reclassified, usually upon sale or liquidation of the investment. The gains (losses) for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense  net on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the underlying debt. Net losses of   $2 million   are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months. 

7. Fair Value Disclosures 
  The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the input to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows: 
  Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
  Level 2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 
  Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Investments are marketable securities traded on an exchange. 
  The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying amounts because of the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues, which is deemed a level 2 measurement. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of Praxair s long-term debt portfolio was   $9,708 million   versus a carrying value of   $9,236 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of Praxair s long-term debt portfolio was   $9,069 million   versus a carrying value of   $8,981 million  . Differences from carrying amounts are attributable to interest-rate changes subsequent to when the debt was issued.

8. Earnings Per Share   Praxair, Inc. Shareholders 
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing Net income   Praxair, Inc. for the period by the weighted average number of Praxair common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing Net income   Praxair, Inc. for the period by the weighted average number of Praxair common shares outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents, as follows: 

Stock options of   2,624,190   and   2,625,825   for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and stock options of   3,893,857   and   2,712,895   for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were antidilutive and therefore excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Praxair has performed its goodwill impairment tests annually during the second quarter of each year, and historically has determined that the fair value of each of its reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value. For the 2016 test completed last quarter, Praxair applied the FASB's accounting guidance (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K) which allows the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine the extent of additional quantitative analysis, if any, that may be required to test goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, Praxair concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, no impairment was recorded.  There were no indicators of impairment through   September 30, 2016  .  
  Changes in the carrying amounts of other intangibles for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

There are no expected residual values related to these intangible assets. The remaining weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets is approximately   18 years  . 
  Total estimated annual amortization expense is as follows:

10. Share-Based Compensation 
  Share-based compensation of   $14 million   (  $10 million   after-tax) and   $8 million   (  $6 million   after-tax) was recognized during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Share-based compensation of   $36 million   (  $26 million   after-tax)     and   $25 million   (  $18 million   after-tax) was recognized during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Expense amounts reflect current estimates of achieving performance targets relating to performance-based compensation. The expense was recorded primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses. There was no share-based compensation cost that was capitalized. For further details regarding Praxair s share-based compensation arrangements and prior-year grants, refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Stock Options 
  The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.91   (  $11.99   in   2015  ) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The decrease in grant date fair value year-over-year was primarily attributable to a decrease in the company's stock price. 
    
  The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in   2016   and   2015  : 

The following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of   September 30, 2016   and changes during the   nine  -month period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): 

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company s closing stock price of   $120.83   as of   September 30, 2016   and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $22 million   and   $64 million  , respectively (  $6 million   and   $57 million   during the same periods in 2015, respectively). 
  Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $41 million   and   $101 million  , respectively (  $9 million   and   $60 million   for the same time periods in   2015  , respectively). The cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled   $7 million   and   $26 million   for the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (  $2 million   and   $31 million   cash tax benefit for the same periods in   2015   ). 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $23 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   1 year  . 
  Performance-Based and Restricted Stock Awards 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the company granted performance-based stock awards to employees of     240,505   shares that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant.  These awards are tied to either return on capital ("ROC") performance or relative total shareholder return ("TSR") performance versus that of the S P 500. The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from   zero   to   200 percent   of the target number of shares granted based upon the company s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a   three  -year period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company s common stock on  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense will be adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the company also granted restricted stock units to employees of   97,542   shares. The majority of the restricted stock units vest at the end of a   three  -year service period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. 
  The weighted-average fair value of ROC performance-based stock awards and restricted stock units granted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $93.46   and $  98.12  , respectively (  $120.04   and   $120.32   for the same periods in   2015  ). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Praxair s common stock on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period.  
  The weighted-average fair value of performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $124.18   (none in 2015), and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date.  
  The following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock award activity as of   September 30, 2016   and changes during the   nine   months then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis): 

There are approximately   12 thousand   performance-based shares and   11 thousand   restricted stock shares that are non-vested at   September 30, 2016   which will be settled in cash due to foreign regulatory limitations. The liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be achieved and the current common stock price.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , based on current estimates of future performance,   $26 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance-based awards is expected to be recognized through the first quarter of 2019 and   $14 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized primarily through the first quarter of 2019.

11. Retirement Programs 
  The components of net pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions ( OPEB ) costs for the quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    and   2015   are shown below: 

Praxair estimates that   2016   required contributions to its pension plans will be in the range of   $10 million   to $  15 million  , of which   $8 million   have been made through   September 30, 2016  . At the end of 2015, the Company changed the approach used to measure service and interest costs for significant pension and OPEB plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve rather than a single weighted-average rate derived from the yield curve (the "spot rate approach"). This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and, as such, is applied on a prospective basis starting in 2016.

12. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Contingent Liabilities 
  Praxair is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Praxair has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company s reported results of operations in any given period (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K). 
  Significant matters are: 
             
    During May 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program ( Refis Program ) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During the 2009 third quarter, Praxair decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government.  The Company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program.  Since 2009, Praxair has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and recently initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters:  (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations, and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil. 
                
    At   September 30, 2016   the most significant non-income and income tax claims in Brazil, after enrollment in the Refis Program, relate to state VAT tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company. The total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately   $220 million  . Praxair has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. Because litigation in Brazil historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. The company is vigorously defending against the proceedings. 
                
    On September 1, 2010, CADE (Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense) announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in Brazil and imposed fines on all five companies. Originally, CADE imposed a civil fine of   R$2.2 billion   Brazilian reais (  US$678 million  ) against White Martins, the Brazil-based subsidiary of Praxair, Inc. In response to a motion for clarification, the fine was reduced to   R$1.7 billion   Brazilian reais (  US$524 million  ) due to a calculation error made by CADE.  The amount of the fine is subject to indexation using SELIC. On September 2, 2010, Praxair issued a press release and filed a report on Form 8-K rejecting all claims and stating that the fine represents a gross and arbitrary disregard of Brazilian law. 
     On October 19, 2010, White Martins filed an annulment petition ( appeal ) with the Federal Court in Brasilia seeking to have the fine against White Martins entirely overturned. In order to suspend payment of the fine pending the completion of the appeal process, Brazilian law required that the company tender a form of guarantee in the amount of the fine as security. Initially,   50%   of the guarantee was satisfied by letters of credit with a financial institution and   50%   by equity of a Brazilian subsidiary. On April 15, 2016, the Ninth Federal Court in Brasilia allowed White Martins to withdraw and cancel the letters of credit.  Accordingly, the guarantee is currently satisfied solely by equity of a Brazilian subsidiary. 
  On September 14, 2015, the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia overturned the fine against White Martins and declared the original CADE administrative proceeding to be null and void. On June 30, 2016, CADE filed an appeal against this decision with the Federal Circuit Court in Brasilia.  
  Praxair strongly believes that the allegations are without merit and that the fine will be entirely overturned during the appeal process. The company further believes that it has strong defenses and will vigorously defend against the allegations and related fine up to such levels of the Federal Courts in Brazil as may be necessary. Because appeals in Brazil historically take many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate when the appeal will be finally decided. Based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel, no reserve has been recorded for this proceeding as management does not believe that a loss is probable.

              (b) 
    The quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , primarily relates to the sale of an ownership interest in a majority-owned joint venture in India.  Prior period amounts relate to increased ownership changes in certain consolidated subsidiaries.  The difference between the purchase price and the related noncontrolling interest was recorded as a decrease in Praxair's additional paid-in-capital.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
  Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put/sell options, that are not solely within the Company s control ( redeemable noncontrolling interests ) are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of carrying value or redemption value. For redeemable noncontrolling interests that are not yet exercisable, Praxair calculates the redemption value by accreting the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until exercisable. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, any increase is adjusted directly to equity and does not impact net income. 
  At September 30, 2016, redeemable noncontrolling interests includes one packaged gas distributor in the United States where the noncontrolling shareholder has a put option. At December 31, 2015, redeemable noncontrolling interests also included Yara Praxair Holding AS, a   66%  -owned joint venture in Scandinavia.  On June 1, 2016, Praxair acquired the remaining   34%   stake in this joint venture for   $104 million  .  The cash payment is shown in the financing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows under the caption "Noncontrolling interest transactions and other".  
  The following is a summary of the changes in redeemable noncontrolling interests for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Consolidated Results 
    
  In the third quarter, Praxair s sales were $2,716 million, 1% above the prior year quarter.  Negative currency translation reduced sales by  1%.  Excluding this impact,  sales were 2% above the third quarter of 2015 due to higher overall pricing which increased sales by 1%, and 1% growth from acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of a European carbon dioxide business completed in the second quarter of 2016.  Overall volumes were comparable to the prior-year quarter, as volume growth from new project start-ups primarily in South America, Asia and Europe were offset by lower base business volumes in the Americas, due primarily to weaker manufacturing activity in the United States and Brazil.   Reported operating profit of $497 million, 18.3% of sales, was 16% below $594 million in the prior-year quarter.  Operating profit was reduced by a $100 million charge related to severance and other cost reduction actions taken in response to weaker underlying industrial activity and a pension settlement charge.  Excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $597 million, 22.0% of sales and 4% below the 2015 adjusted third quarter.  Excluding 1% negative currency translation, adjusted operating profit was 3% below the prior-year as growth from higher pricing was more than offset by the impact of volumes.   The company's adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 32.8%.  Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") was $1.18, 16% below reported EPS of $1.40 in the third quarter of 2015.  On an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.41, 3% below the 2015 adjusted EPS of $1.46, as lower operating profit was partially offset by a lower tax rate. 
  Outlook 
  Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of   2016   is expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.43 and reported GAAP diluted EPS for the full year of   2016   is expected to be in the range of $5.17 to $5.24.  
  Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year of   2016   is expected to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.51 which excludes the impact of a (i) bond redemption charge recorded in the first quarter, and (ii) a pension settlement and cost reduction and other charges recorded in the third quarter.  See Notes 2 and 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.4 billion. 
    
  The company s core business is to build, own, and operate industrial gas plants in order to supply atmospheric and process gases to customers. As such, Praxair believes that its backlog is one indicator of future sales growth.  At   September 30, 2016  , Praxair s backlog of 19 large projects under construction was $1.4 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction. These plants will supply customers in the  energy, chemical, manufacturing, and electronics markets.  
  Praxair provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial earnings guidance via quarterly earnings releases and investor teleconferences. These updates are available on the company s website, www.praxair.com, but are not incorporated herein.

Results of Operations 
  The changes in consolidated sales and operating profit compared to the prior year are attributable to the following: 

The following tables provide sales by end-market and distribution method: 

*   Excludes impact of currency, natural gas/precious metals cost pass-through and acquisitions/divestitures. 

Sales   increased   $  30 million  , or   1%  , for the   third quarter   versus the respective 2015 period.  Higher overall pricing, primarily in North and South America, contributed   1%   to sales, and acquisitions, largely in Europe, added an incremental   1%   to sales.  These increases however were partially offset by negative currency translation impact of   1%  .  Sales   decreased     $291 million  , or   4%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   period primarily due to negative currency translation impacts of   4%  .

Gross margin   decreased   $  15 million  , or   1%  , for the   third quarter   and   decreased     $139 million  , or   4%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   periods, primarily due foreign currency translation impacts. Gross margin as percentage of sales declined to   43.6%   from   44.6%   for the   third quarter   and declined to 44.5% from 44.6% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   periods.   
    
  Selling, general and administrative expense ("SG A")   increased      $10 million  , or   4%  , for the   third quarter   and   decreased     $4 million  , or   0%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   periods.  Currency effects on SG A for the quarter were flat when compared to the prior year and currency reduced SG A expense by $30 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the prior year.  Excluding currency effects, SG A increased $26 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   period.  In both periods, acquisitions, cost inflation and higher incentive compensation increased SG A which were partially offset by benefits from cost reduction programs. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense   increased     $8 million  , or   3%  , for the   third quarter   and   increased     $6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   periods.  Currency effects reduced depreciation and amortization expense by $2 million and $30 million for the quarter and nine-month periods respectively.  These currency decreases were more than offset by higher depreciation primarily due to large project start-ups and acquisitions.  
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, Praxair recorded charges of $100 million related primarily to a cost reduction program (refer to note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).  This program is expected to result in annualized pre-tax expense reductions and cash flows increases of approximately $45 million.  During 2015, Praxair recorded charges of $146 million in the second quarter and $19 million in the third quarter also related primarily to a cost reduction program (refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Praxair's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K).  The 2015 cost reduction actions are expected to result in annualized pre-tax expense reductions and cash flow increases of approximately $80 million and, to date, have met expectations excluding any currency translation impacts. 
    
  Other income (expense)   net was   $11 million   income for the   quarter ended September 30, 2016   and    $10 million   income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to net gains on asset sales primarily in North America during the third quarter.   Other income was   $2 million   income and zero for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 respectively.  
    
  Reported operating profit   decreased     $97 million  , or   16%  , for the   third quarter   versus   2015  . During the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 there were charges of $100 million and $26 million, respectively, primarily related to cost reduction programs and other charges and pension settlements.  Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit decreased $23 million, or 4%, for the   third quarter   versus   2015   as the impact of higher pricing was more than offset by volumes and negative currency impacts.  Reported operating profit   decreased     $58 million  , or   3%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the prior year.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there were charges of $100 million and $172 million, respectively, primarily related to the cost reduction programs and other charges.  Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit decreased $130 million, or 7%, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the prior year.  Excluding negative currency of    4%  , adjusted operating profit decreased 3% as higher pricing was more than offset by lower volumes and higher costs.  
    
  Interest expense-net   increased     $8 million  , or   23%  , for the   third quarter   and   increased     $33 million  , or   28%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   periods.   Included within interest expense-net  for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a $16 million charge relating to a bond redemption (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) recorded during the first quarter of 2016.  Excluding this charge, adjusted interest expense-net increased $17 million, or 14% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   periods.  These increases were primarily attributable to higher average interest rates due primarily to extending debt maturities. 
    
  The reported effective tax rate ("ETR") for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 26.4% and 27.9%, respectively.  The ETR for the 2016 quarter includes a $29 million tax benefit related to a pension settlement charge and cost reduction program.  The 2015 quarter includes an $8 million tax benefit related to a pension settlement and cost reduction program and other charges (see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).   Excluding these impacts, on an adjusted basis the ETR for the 2016 and 2015 quarters was 26.9% and 27.9%, respectively.  The lower adjusted ETR in 2016 is due to a  $5 million excess tax benefit on share-based compensation resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard during the second quarter of the current year (see Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).  The reported ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 26.8% and 28.5%, respectively. The ETR for the 2016 period includes a $35 million tax benefit related to a pension settlement, bond redemption and cost reduction program and other charges.  The 2015 period includes a $41 million tax benefit related to a pension settlement and cost reduction program and other charges (see Note 2).  Excluding these impacts, on an adjusted basis the ETR for the 2016 and 2015 periods was 27.1

% and 28%, respectively.  The lower adjusted ETR in 2016 is due to a  $15 million excess tax benefit on share-based compensation from  the adoption of a new accounting standard (see Note 1).  
    
  Income from equity investments was   $10 million   for both the   quarters ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and was   $31 million   for both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Praxair s significant sources of equity income are in China, Italy, and the Middle East.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , non-controlling interests consisted primarily of non-controlling shareholders' investments in Asia (primarily China) and Europe (primarily Italy). Non-controlling interests   decreased   $  7 million   for the   third quarter   and   decreased     $10 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the respective   2015   periods.  Non-controlling interest for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 both included a reduction of $5 million related to the current year cost reduction program.  The remaining decrease in both periods was primarily attributable to the divestiture of a controlling interest in a U.S. packaged gas business during the fourth quarter of    2015  . 
    
  Reported Net income-Praxair, Inc.   decreased     $62 million  , or   15%  , for the   third quarter   versus the respective period in   2015  .    Included within the third quarter 2016 and 2015 were after-tax and non-controlling interest charges of $66 million and $18 million, respectively, related to the cost reduction program and other charges and pension settlements.  Excluding these charges, Adjusted Net income-Praxair, Inc decreased $14 million, or 3%, primarily due to lower adjusted operating profit partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.  Reported Net income-Praxair, Inc.   decreased     $31 million  , or   3%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    versus the respective period in   2015  .   Included within the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were after-tax and non-controlling interest charges of $66 million and $130 million, respectively, related to the cost reduction program and other charges and pension settlements. In addition, the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included a $10 million after-tax charge from a bond redemption (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) recorded during the first quarter of 2016. Excluding these charges, adjusted Net income-Praxair, Inc decreased $85 million, or 7%, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    versus the respective period in   2015   primarily due to lower adjusted operating profit partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.   
    
  Reported Earnings per share of   $1.18     decreased     $0.22  , or   16%  , for the   third quarter   versus the comparable period in   2015  .  Included within the third quarter 2016 and 2015 were charges of $0.23 and $0.06, respectively, related to the cost reduction program and other charges and pension settlements.  Excluding these charges, Adjusted Earnings per share decreased $0.05, or 3%, primarily due to lower adjusted net income.   Reported Earnings per share of $3.80 decreased $0.08, or 2%, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .    Included within the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were charges of $0.23 and $0.45, respectively, related to the cost reduction program and other charges and pension settlements.   In addition, the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included a $0.04 charge from a bond redemption (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) recorded during the first quarter of 2016.  Excluding these charges, adjusted earnings per share decreased $0.26, or 6%, primarily due to lower adjusted net income which was partially offset by a  reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of the company's net repurchases of common stock over the past year.  
    
  The number of employees at   September 30, 2016    was   26,680  , a decrease of 309 employees from   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease primarily reflects the impact of cost reduction programs implemented during the previous year and was partially offset by increases due to acquisitions.   
    
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  Other comprehensive income (loss) for the   third quarter   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $(34) million   and   $396 million  , respectively, resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars.  Generally, positive translation adjustments result from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies, while negative translation adjustments result from a strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  See "Currency" section of the MD A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment. 

Retirement Benefits 
    
  The net periodic cost for pension and OPEB plans was   $19 million   and   $32 million   in the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively and $  47 million   and $  84 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 respectively.  These decreases are due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses as a result of an increase in discount rates, and a change in the approach for measuring service and interest costs by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve rather than a single

The North America segment includes Praxair's industrial gases operations in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  
  North America segment sales   decreased   $  32 million  , or   2%   in the   third quarter   and $  249 million  , or 6% for the nine-month period as compared to the prior year.  For the quarter, excluding currency and cost pass-through impacts, sales were comparable to the prior-year. For the nine-month period, excluding currency and cost pass-through impacts, sales were 2% below the prior year due to lower volumes, primarily packaged gases, partially offset by higher pricing. By end-market, lower sales primarily to the manufacturing and upstream energy markets were partially offset by growth in food and beverage and healthcare.  
    
  North America segment operating profit   decreased   $  22 million  , or   6%   in the   third quarter   and $81 million or 7% for the nine-month period as compared to the prior-year due to lower volumes and currency impacts which were partially offset by the impact of higher pricing.

Europe segment sales   increased   by   $28 million  , or   8%   in the   third quarter   and $46 million, or 5% for the nine-month period as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, sales decreased 1% for the quarter primarily due to a prior-year sale of equipment; underlying sales were steady with the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales grew 2% for the nine-month period due to higher merchant volumes and volume growth from new project start-ups. In addition, acquisitions, primarily a carbon dioxide business largely serving the food and beverage market, contributed growth of 9% and 4% for the quarter and nine-month period, respectively. The increase in the percentage of merchant sales year-over-year is primarily due to the acquisition of the carbon dioxide business. Refer to Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.  
  Europe segment operating profit increased by $9 million, or 14% in the third quarter and $14 million, or 7% for the nine-month period as compared to the prior year. For the quarter and nine-month period, the increase in operating profit was primarily due to cost reduction actions, acquisitions and higher pricing.

South America segment sales in the   third quarter     increased     $35 million  , or   10%  , versus the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency and cost pass-through, sales grew 7% primarily due to higher overall pricing which increased sales by   5%   coupled with a   2%   increase due to higher volumes primarily attributable to new plant start-ups for metals customers partially offset by weaker sales to the manufacturing end-market. For the nine-month period sales   decreased     $85 million  , or   8%  , from 2015.  Excluding currency, sales grew 5% due to higher overall pricing and volumes. Volumes in South America were steady as growth to metals (including project contribution), healthcare and food and beverage end-markets were offset by lower sales to manufacturing due to weak industrial production. 
    
  Segment operating profit   decreased   $  2 million  , or   3%  , versus the prior-year quarter and   decreased     $43 million  , or   18%  , for the nine-month period year-over-year.  Excluding currency translation, operating profit was 4% below the prior-year quarter primarily attributable to higher costs, including inflation, and lower operating profit due to product sales mix, partially offset by higher price. In addition, the current quarter impact includes a benefit from a customer contract settlement. For the nine-month period, operating profit was 4% below the prior year, excluding the effects of negative currency translation, largely for the same reasons discussed above.

Asia segment sales   decreased     $4 million  , or   1%   in the   third quarter   as compared to the prior year. Currency translation reduced sales by   2%   primarily due to the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. Cost pass-through increased sales by 1%. Volume growth of 2% included new plant start-ups in China serving chemical customers, partially offset by customer turnarounds. Pricing was lower than the prior year by 1%.  By end-market, sales growth was strongest to the chemicals and metals end-markets.  For the nine-month period, sales   increased     $7 million  , or   1%  ,  as compared to the prior year largely for the same reasons discussed above.  
  Asia segment operating profit   decreased     $9 million  , or   12%   in the   third quarter   as compared to the prior year. Excluding negative currency effects, operating profit decreased by 10%.  This decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes and pricing, partially offset by cost reduction actions.  Divestitures decreased operating profit by   3%   due to the sale of an ownership interest in a majority-owned joint venture in India.  The sale  did not result in a gain or loss.   In addition, the prior year impact included a benefit from a customer contract  settlement. For the nine month period, operating profit   decreased     $17 million  , or   8%  , as compared to the prior-year largely for the same reasons discussed above.

  Surface Technologies segment sales increased $  3 million  , or   2%   in the quarter versus the prior year.  Sales increased 3% due to higher volumes and price, and increased 1% due to acquisitions.  Higher volumes and price were primarily driven by strong sales to the aerospace end-market.  These increases were partially offset by 1% negative translation impacts and 1% lower cost pass-through.  Sales decreased $  10 million  , or 2% for the nine-month period as compared to the prior year.  Lower volumes, primarily to the energy and manufacturing end markets, decreased sales by 1%. 
    
  Surface Technologies segment operating profit   increased   $  1 million  , or   4%   in the quarter versus the prior year, increased volumes and price contributed 7%, however was partially offset by 1% negative currency impacts and 2% higher costs year over year.  Operating profit decreased $  3 million  , or 4% for the nine-month period as compared to the prior year due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher pricing and lower costs.  
    
  Effective October 1, 2016 Surface Technologies completed the formation of PG Technologies, LLC ("PGT"), a majority-owned joint venture with GE Aviation ("GE") for the development, support and application of specialized coatings tailored for GE's and CFM International s (a GE joint venture with Safran Aircraft Engines of France) current and future engine models, including the GE9X and LEAP engines. PGT will expand its footprint with a new coatings plant in the southeast United States, which will supplement the services provided to GE.

Currency 
  The results of Praxair s non-U.S. operations are translated to the company s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, from the functional currencies. For most foreign operations, Praxair uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Praxair s results of operations in any given period. 
  To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Praxair s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar):

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Financial Data 
  The following selected cash flow information provides a basis for the discussion that follows: 

(a) Non-GAAP measures. See the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section for definitions and reconciliations to reported amounts.  
  Cash Flow from Operations 
  Cash provided by operations of   $2,047 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $143 million  , or   8%  , versus   2015  .  The increase was primarily attributable to lower working capital requirements and favorable changes in other long-term assets and liabilities which were partially offset by lower net income adjusted for non-cash charges.

     Table of Contents  

Praxair estimates that total   2016   required contributions to its pension plans will be in the area of   $10 million   to   $15 million  , of which $  8 million   has been made through   September 30, 2016  . At a minimum, Praxair contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of the cash. Changes to these factors can impact the amount and timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. 
  Investing 
  Net cash used for investing of   $1,360 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   $408 million versus   2015   primarily due to higher acquisitions and lower proceeds from divestiture and asset sales, partially offset by lower capital expenditures.   
  Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,056 million  ,   $98 million   lower than the prior year.      Capital expenditures related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth and density.  Approximately 60% of the capital expenditures were in North America. 
  Acquisitions for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    were   $345 million  , primarily due to the acquisition of a European CO2 business and packaged gases businesses in North America and Europe.  Acquisitions in the prior-year period of $  43 million   primarily relate to a packaged gases business in North and South America (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   divestitures and asset sales were   $41 million   primarily due to the sale of an ownership interest in a majority-owned joint venture in India.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   divestitures and asset sales were $  245 million  , primarily due to the sale of fixed assets under construction to a customer in the North America energy market.  
  Financing 
  Cash used by financing activities was   $232 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Cash dividends of   $642 million   were higher than the prior year due to a   5%   increase in quarterly dividends per share from $2.145 to $2.25.  Net repurchases of common stock decreased $606 million due primarily to fewer treasury share purchases and debt net of increased by $556 million.  Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $122 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and primarily included the acquisition of the remaining   34%   of Yara Praxair Holding AS in Scandinavia (see Note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).   
    
  In February 2016, Praxair repaid $  400 million   of 0.75% notes that became due.   Also in February 2016, Praxair redeemed $  325 million   of 5.20% notes due March 2017 resulting in a $16 million charge to interest expense ($10 million after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). 
    
  In February 2016, Praxair issued    550 million   ($  615 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) of   1.20%   Euro-denominated notes due   2024  .  In addition, Praxair issued   $275 million   of   3.20%   notes due   2026  . 
    
  Debt Covenants 
  Praxair s $2.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility and long-term debt agreements contain various covenants (refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K).  The only financial covenant requires Praxair not to exceed a maximum 70% leverage ratio, as defined in the agreements.  For purposes of the leverage ratio calculation, consolidated shareholders' equity excludes changes in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments after June 30, 2011.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the actual leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 53% and 53%, respectively. 
    
  Other Financial Data 
    
  Praxair's debt-to-capital ratio was   62.0%   at   September 30, 2016   versus   66.0%   at   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a reduction in net debt of $129 million; (ii) an increase in equity due to currency translation impacts on the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component as well as increases to equity due to earnings net of dividends declared and (iii) a decrease of $158 million in redeemable noncontrolling interests  primarily due to the acquisition of a 34% stake in a consolidated joint venture.

After-tax return on capital ("ROC") was   12.1%   for the four-quarter trailing period ended   September 30, 2016   versus   12.5%   for the   2015   period.  This decrease is because net operating profit after tax ("NOPAT") has decreased more than capital has decreased, as more fully described throughout the previous MD A sections. 
    
  Return on equity ("ROE") for the four-quarter trailing period ended   September 30, 2016   was strong at   33.3%   and was 80 basis-points above the prior year.  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA decreased $15 million to $  891 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and decreased $124 million to   $2,607 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus prior year periods.  These decreases in adjusted EBITDA are primarily due to lower adjusted net income versus the prior year primarily due to negative currency translation impacts and lower volumes.  
    
  Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA was   2.6   and   2.5   for the four-quarter trailing period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, primarily due to lower adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted amounts for 2014 exclude the impact of the fourth quarter pension settlement, bond redemption, and Venezuela currency devaluation. The company does not believe these items are indicative of on-going business trends and, accordingly, the impact is excluded from the reported amounts so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. For a description of  these items, refer to Notes 2, 5   11 to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Certain amounts for 2015 and 2014 have been included for reference purposes and to facilitate the calculations contained herein.
