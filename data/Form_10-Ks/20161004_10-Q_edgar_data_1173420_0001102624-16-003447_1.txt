This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements or information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning anticipated results and developments in our operations in future periods, planned exploration activities, the adequacy of our financial resources and other events or conditions that may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements may include statements regarding perceived merit of our properties, exploration results and budgets, mineral reserves and resource estimates, work programs, capital expenditures, operating costs, cash flow estimates, production estimates and similar statements relating to the economic viability of a project, timelines, strategic plans, including our plans and expectations relating to the permitting and development of the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek projects, completion of transactions, market prices for precious and base metals, or other statements that are not statements of fact. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management. Statements concerning mineral resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute  forward-looking statements  to the extent that they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if the property is developed.

Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, identified by words or phrases such as  expects ,  is expected ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  plans ,  projects ,  estimates ,  assumes ,  intends ,  strategy ,  goals ,  objectives ,  potential ,  possible  or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events, conditions or results  may ,  could ,  would ,  should ,  might  or  will  be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material assumptions, including those listed below, which could prove to be significantly incorrect:

our ability to achieve production at any of our mineral exploration and development properties;

estimated capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns;

estimated metal pricing, metallurgy, mineability, marketability and operating and capital costs, together with other assumptions underlying our resource and reserve estimates;

our expected ability to develop adequate infrastructure and that the cost of doing so will be reasonable;

assumptions that all necessary permits and governmental approvals will be obtained;

assumptions made in the interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of our mineral deposits;

our expectations regarding demand for equipment, skilled labor and services needed for exploration and development of mineral properties; and

that our activities will not be adversely disrupted or impeded by development, operating or regulatory risks.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:

uncertainty of whether there will ever be production at our mineral exploration and development properties;

uncertainty of estimates of capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns;

uncertainties relating to the assumptions underlying our resource and reserve estimates, such as metal pricing, metallurgy, mineability, marketability and operating and capital costs;

risks related to our ability to commence production and generate material revenues or obtain adequate financing for our planned exploration and development activities;

risks related to our ability to finance the development of our mineral properties through external financing, strategic alliances, the sale of property interests or otherwise;

risks related to the third parties on which we depend for our exploration and development activities;

dependence on cooperation of joint venture partners in exploration and development of properties;

credit, liquidity, interest rate and currency risks;

risks related to market events and general economic conditions;

uncertainty related to inferred mineral resources;

risks and uncertainties relating to the interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of our mineral deposits;

risks related to lack of infrastructure required to develop, construct, and operate our mineral properties;

mining and development risks, including risks related to infrastructure, accidents, equipment breakdowns, labor disputes or other unanticipated difficulties with, or interruptions in, development, construction or production;

the risk that permits and governmental approvals necessary to develop and operate mines on our properties will not be available on a timely basis, subject to reasonable conditions, or at all;

commodity price fluctuations;

risks related to governmental regulation and permits, including environmental regulation;

risks related to the need for reclamation activities on our properties and uncertainty of cost estimates related thereto;

uncertainty related to title to our mineral properties;

uncertainty related to unsettled aboriginal rights and title in British Columbia;

our history of losses and expectation of future losses;

uncertainty as to the outcome of potential litigation;

risks related to our largest shareholder;

risks related to increases in demand for equipment, skilled labor and services needed for exploration and development of mineral properties, and related cost increases;

competition in the mining industry;

our need to attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel;

risks related to our current practice of not using hedging arrangements;

risks related to conflicts of interests of some of the directors of the Company;

risks related to global climate change;

risks related to opposition to our operations at our mineral exploration and development properties from non-governmental organizations or civil society; and

increased regulatory compliance costs relating to the Dodd-Frank Act.

This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently uncertain, and our actual achievements or other future events or conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, without limitation, those referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the heading  Risk Factors  and elsewhere.

Our forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management as of the date of this report. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management s beliefs, expectations or opinions should change, except as required by law. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited, US dollars in thousands except per share amounts)

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively,  NOVAGOLD  or the  Company ) operates in the mining industry, focused on the exploration for and development of gold and copper mineral properties. The Company has no operations or realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose. The Company s principal assets include a 50% interest in the Donlin Gold project in Alaska, U.S.A. and a 50% interest in the Galore Creek project in British Columbia, Canada.

The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements of NOVAGOLD are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have been included. The results reported in these interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year. These interim statements should be read in conjunction with NOVAGOLD s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended November 30, 2015. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements and certain information and footnote disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) have been condensed or omitted.

The functional currency for the Company s Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar and the functional currency for the Company s U.S. operations is the U.S. dollar. References to  $  refer to United States currency and  C$  to Canadian currency. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except for per share amounts.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

In February 2015, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) guidance was issued to amend current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models and primarily relate to: limited partnerships and similar legal entities; evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest; the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination; the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination; and certain investment funds. The Company determined that these changes did not have an impact on its previous consolidation analysis and elected early adoption of the new standard effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2016. Application of the new guidance had no impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

In August 2016, ASC guidance was issued to amend the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year and interim periods beginning December 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Compensation Stock Compensation

In March 2016, ASC guidance was issued to amend employee share-based payment accounting. The new guidance amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year and interim periods beginning December 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If adopted in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. All of the amendments must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Leases

In February 2016, ASC guidance was issued to amend lease accounting guidance. The new guidance amends the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases and amends disclosure requirements associated with leasing arrangements. The new guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments

In January 2016, ASC guidance was issued to amend the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance significantly revises an entity s accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The new guidance also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2018. Early adoption for most of the provisions is not allowed. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3   SEGMENTED INFORMATION

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer considers the business from a geographic perspective considering the performance of our investments in the Donlin Gold project in Alaska, U.S.A. and the Galore Creek project in British Columbia, Canada. Segment information is provided on each of the material projects individually in notes 4 and 5.

NOTE 4   INVESTMENT IN DONLIN GOLD

The Donlin Gold project is owned and operated by Donlin Gold LLC, a limited liability company in which wholly owned subsidiaries of Barrick Gold Corporation ( Barrick ) and NOVAGOLD each own a 50% interest. Donlin Gold LLC has a board of four directors, with two directors selected by Barrick and two directors selected by the Company. All significant decisions related to Donlin Gold LLC require the approval of both Barrick and the Company.

Changes in the Company s 50% investment in Donlin Gold LLC are summarized as follows:

The following amounts represent the Company s 50% share of the assets and liabilities of Donlin Gold LLC. Donlin Gold LLC has capitalized as Mineral property the initial contribution of the Donlin Gold property with a carrying value of $64,000 resulting in a higher carrying value of the Mineral property than the Company.

NOTE 5   INVESTMENT IN GALORE CREEK

The Galore Creek project is owned by Galore Creek Partnership (GCP), a partnership in which Teck Resources Limited ( Teck ) and a wholly owned subsidiary of NOVAGOLD each own a 50% interest. GCP has a board of four directors, with two members selected by Teck and two members selected by the Company. All significant decisions related to GCP require the approval of both Teck and the Company.

GCP prepares its financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the IASB, and presents its financial statements in Canadian dollars. In accounting for its investment in GCP, the Company converts and presents reported amounts in accordance with US GAAP and in U.S. dollars.

Changes in the Company s investment in GCP are summarized as follows:

The following amounts represent the Company s 50% share of the assets and liabilities of GCP presented in U.S. dollars and in accordance with US GAAP. As a result of recording the Company s investment at fair value in June 2011, the carrying value of the Company s 50% interest is higher than 50% of the book value of GCP. Therefore, the Company s investment does not equal 50% of the net assets recorded by GCP:

(Unaudited, US dollars in thousands except per share amounts)

NOTE 6   PROMISSORY NOTE

The Company has a promissory note payable to Barrick for $51,576, plus interest at a rate of U.S. prime plus 2%, amounting to $32,084 in accrued interest. The promissory note resulted from the agreement that led to the formation of Donlin Gold LLC, where the Company agreed to reimburse Barrick for a portion of their expenditures incurred from April 1, 2006 to November 30, 2007. The promissory note and accrued interest are payable from 85% of the Company s share of revenue from future mine production or from any net proceeds resulting from a reduction of the Company s interest in Donlin Gold LLC. The carrying value of the promissory note approximates fair value.

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING

Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;

Level 2    Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3    Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

The Company s marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the marketable equity securities was $1,303 at August 31, 2016 ($571 at November 30, 2015), calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company.

NOTE 8   GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

NOTE 9   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

In the first nine months of 2016, the Company granted 4,586,700 share options to employees and directors with an exercise price of C$5.02 per share and a fair value of C$1.83 per share. The Company also granted 1,241,900 performance share units (PSUs) to employees with a fair value of C$4.65 per unit. PSU grants made on January 4, 2014 vested and were paid out on December 1, 2015 in common shares of the Company at 140% of the PSU grant amount. The Company elected to remit PSU withholding taxes of $4,275 using cash and issued the net amount of 1,377,364 shares to holders.

In the first nine months of 2015, the Company granted 4,359,450 share options to employees and directors with an exercise price of C$3.18 per share and a fair value of C$1.28 per share.

NOTE 10   OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

During the nine month period ended August 31, 2015, a loss of $426 related to marketable equity securities was reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to net loss.

NOTE 11   CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

NOTE 12   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During the first nine months of 2016, the Company provided office rental and services to GCP for $251 ($266 in the first nine months of 2015).

As of August 31, 2016, the Company has accounts receivable from GCP of $28 (November 30, 2015: $28) included in other current assets and a receivable of $3,610 (November 30, 2015: $3,546) from GCP included in other long-term assets.

NOTE 13   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General

The Company follows ASC guidance in determining its accruals and disclosures with respect to loss contingencies. Accordingly, estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.

Obligations under operating leases

The Company leases certain assets, such as office equipment and office facilities, under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2017. Future minimum annual lease payments are $93 in the remainder of 2016, $325 in 2017 and $18 in 2018, totaling $436.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  NOVAGOLD , the  Company ,  we,   us  and  our  refer to NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations constitutes management s review of the factors that affected our financial and operating performance for the three and nine month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated interim financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2015, as well as other information we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR at www.sec.gov  and with Canadian Securities Administrators on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . 

Overview

Our operations primarily relate to the delivery of project milestones, including the achievement of various technical, environmental, sustainable development, economic and legal objectives, obtaining necessary permits, preparation of engineering designs and the financing to fund these objectives.

Our goals for 2016 include:

Advance the Donlin Gold project toward a construction decision.

Advance Galore Creek mine planning and project design.

Evaluate opportunities to monetize the value of Galore Creek.

Maintain a healthy balance sheet.

Maintain an effective corporate social responsibility program.

Third quarter highlights

Advancement of the Donlin Gold project

In the third quarter of 2016, permitting activities continued at Donlin Gold and were focused  on advancing  major permits and approvals with State and Federal agencies as well as providing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the  Corps ), the lead agency for the Donlin Gold Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), with requested input and information. The EIS is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the act that governs the process by which most major projects in the United States are evaluated. The EIS is also, in large part, a determining factor in the overall permitting timeline which commenced in 2012 for Donlin Gold. This document is comprised of four main sections which:

Outline of the purpose and need for the development of the proposed mine and the benefit it would bring to the stakeholders of Donlin Gold s Alaska Native Corporation partners, Calista Corporation and The Kuskokwim Corporation (TKC).

Identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the mine development proposed by Donlin Gold which comprise variations on certain mine site facility designs, as well as local transportation and power supply options.

Prepare an environmental analysis of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives (including a no action alternative), which identifies and characterizes the potential physical, biological, social, and cultural impacts relative to the existing baseline conditions. This portion constitutes the most extensive part of the EIS.

Describe potential mitigation measures intended to reduce or eliminate the environmental impacts described in the impact analysis section.

The  Corps filed the draft EIS in November 2015. Following the filing of the draft EIS, the Corps conducted 17 meetings in communities across the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) region and in Anchorage. The six-month public comment period for the draft EIS  was completed on May 31, 2016. The public comment meetings gave the Corps an opportunity to present an overview of the draft EIS, which evaluates the potential environmental, social and economic impacts of the proposed project together with alternatives. The meetings also served as an excellent platform for stakeholders to ask questions and provide comments on the draft EIS. The Corps received approximately 600 separate comment submittals, including letters and public statements from Alaska Native Corporations, business groups, communities, the State of Alaska and other Federal agencies. The Corps is reviewing the comments to assess what studies or work would be required to prepare the final EIS. The Corps is working to establish a target release date for the final EIS, which is required before the Corps can issue a record of decision on Donlin Gold s Clean Water Act Section 404 (wetland) and 10 (rivers and harbors) permit application. All Donlin Gold EIS  documents, including the Corps  time table for the Donlin Gold EIS process, can be found on their website at  www.donlingoldeis.com .

10 

In addition to actively participating in the NEPA process, Donlin Gold continues to advance other major permits and approvals by providing State and Federal agencies with information on major permit applications, including:

working with the State to advance the review of Donlin Gold s air quality permit application and preparation of the air quality permit, targeted for issuance in 2017;

advancing the water discharge permit application and working with the State to advance the review of the integrated waste management permit application and reclamation plan;

the Corps provided opportunities for public comment on Donlin Gold s Public Notice CWA Section 404 (wetland)/10 (rivers and harbors) permit application as part of the draft EIS comment period which closed on May 31, 2016;

Donlin Gold continues to work with State and Federal agencies to advance issuance of all other required permits, including dam safety approvals, pipeline authorizations, water use permits, fish habitat permits, as well as land and shoreline lease and right-of-way approvals.

An extensive list of additional Federal and State government permits and approvals must be obtained before the Donlin Gold project can commence construction. Preparation of the applications for some of these permits and approvals requires additional, more detailed engineering that was not part of the Donlin Gold feasibility study. Completion of this engineering will require a significant investment of funds, time, and other resources by Donlin Gold and its contractors. Also, the Donlin Gold board must approve a construction program and budget before proceeding with the development of the Donlin Gold project. The timing of the required engineering work and the Donlin Gold board s approval of a construction program and budget, the receipt of all required governmental permits and approvals, and the availability of financing, among other factors, will affect the decision and timing to develop the Donlin Gold project. Among other reasons, project delays could occur as a result of public opposition, requests for additional information or analysis, limitations in agency staff resources during regulatory review and permitting, or project changes made by Donlin Gold.

As the Donlin Gold EIS and permitting processes progress, the owners (Barrick Gold Corporation and NOVAGOLD) are studying ways to further enhance the project s value and minimize initial capital, such as modular construction techniques, more selective mining methods, automation of certain mining activities and other opportunities. To date, these additional studies have identified opportunities that have the potential to benefit the project when the owners decide to update the feasibility study, which was completed in 2011, and to initiate the engineering work necessary to advance the project design from feasibility level to basic and then detailed engineering. The owners will take all of this work into account before reaching a construction decision.

Our share of cash funding for Donlin Gold was $2.5 million and $7.2 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, for permitting, community engagement and workforce development efforts. Our 50% share of the 2016 work program is expected to be approximately $9 million. The 2016 work program and budget includes funds to continue to advance the permitting and EIS processes. In addition, Donlin Gold continues to maintain its engagement with communities in the Y-K region.

We record our interest in the Donlin Gold project as an equity investment, which results in our 50% share of Donlin Gold s expenses being recorded in the income statement as an operating loss. The investment amount recorded on the balance sheet primarily represents unused funds advanced to Donlin Gold.

Galore Creek project

In the third quarter of 2016, the Galore Creek Partnership continued to advance technical studies to optimize the project design. Final reports were completed on the first phase of the tunneling evaluation for access and material handling as well as enhancements to the mining, waste rock and water management plans. We expect this effort to further improve the value and marketability of the Galore Creek project, which we continue to be open to monetizing, in whole or in part, to strengthen our balance sheet and to contribute toward the development of the Donlin Gold project.

Our share of cash funding for Galore Creek was $0.2 million and $0.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, for technical studies, care and maintenance, and supporting community initiatives. In 2016, our 50% share of the work program is expected to be approximately $1 million to continue to advance technical studies, support community initiatives and provide site care and maintenance.

11 

We record our interest in the Galore Creek Partnership as an equity investment, which results in our 50% share of expenses being recorded in the income statement as an operating loss. The investment amount recorded on the balance sheet primarily represents the fair value of our investment in the Galore Creek Partnership in 2011, recorded upon completion of the earn-in by Teck Resources Limited, as well as unused funds advanced to the Partnership, all in Canadian dollars, and translated to U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate.

A sustained decline in the long-term copper price is deemed to be an indicator of possible impairment for our investment in the Galore Creek Partnership and our 40% direct interest in the Copper Canyon mineral property. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian operations and therefore we assess whether there has been a potential impairment triggering event related to copper prices in Canadian dollars. In Canadian dollar terms, there has not been a significant decline in the price of copper and therefore is not presently an indicator of possible impairment.

Outlook

We do not currently generate operating cash flows. At August 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $28.5 million and term deposits of $80.0 million.  At present, we believe that these balances are sufficient to support our operations for the next twelve months and to cover the anticipated funding at the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek projects, in addition to general and administrative costs through completion of permitting at the Donlin Gold project. Additional capital may be necessary if the owners decide to update the feasibility study and initiate the engineering work necessary to advance the project design from feasibility level to basic and then to detailed engineering. Once a construction decision is reached, further capital will be needed. Future financings to fund construction are anticipated through a combination of debt financing, equity financing, project specific debt, or other means. Our continued operations are dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing or to generate future cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital.  For further information, see the r isk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2015,  as filed with the SEC and the Canadian Securities Regulators on January 27, 2016. 

For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $23 million; $2 million lower than our original forecast. We expect to spend approximately $10 million to fund our share of expenditures at the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek projects; $11 million for general and administrative costs, and $2 million for working capital and other corporate purposes. A total of $18 million was expended as of August 31, 2016.

Summary of Consolidated Financial Performance

Results of Operations

Third quarter 2016 compared to 2015

Loss from operations decreased from $6.6 million in 2015 to $6.4 million in 2016, primarily due to a reduction of our share of losses at the Donlin Gold project, partially offset by a gain on the sale of equipment at Galore Creek in the third quarter of 2015.

Net loss increased from $6.3 million ($0.02 per share) in 2015 to $7.4 million ($0.02 per share) in 2016, primarily due to a $1.1 million foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2015.  The U.S. dollar significantly strengthened in relation to the Canadian dollar during the third quarter of 2015 and a foreign exchange gain was realized by the Canadian parent company on its cash denominated in U.S. dollars.

First nine months 2016 compared to 2015

Loss from operations decreased from $25.1 million in 2015 to $23.3 million in 2016, primarily due to a reduction of our share of losses at the Donlin Gold project, as 2016 activities continued to focus on permitting and the EIS processes.

12 

Net loss increased from $24.8 million ($0.08 per share) in 2015 to $26.5 million ($0.08 per share) in 2016, primarily due to a $4.4 million foreign exchange gain in 2015, partially offset by the reduction in loss from operations and lower interest expense. The U.S. dollar significantly strengthened in relation to the Canadian dollar during the first nine months of 2015 and a foreign exchange gain was realized by the Canadian parent company on its cash denominated in U.S. dollars.

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Requirements

Third quarter 2016 compared to 2015

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3.3 million during the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in cash was primarily related to $2.7 million to fund our share of the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek projects and $0.5 million used in operating activities for administrative costs and working capital.

Cash used in operations decreased from $1.8 million in 2015, to $0.5 million in 2016, primarily due to the receipt of exploration tax credits resulting from drilling programs at Galore Creek in prior years.

First nine months 2016 compared to 2015

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $13.3 million and term deposits decreased by $5.0 million during the first nine months of 2016. The decrease in cash was primarily related to $10.4 million used in operating activities for administrative costs and withholding taxes paid on performance share units vested and $7.9 million to fund our share of the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek projects, partially offset by a $5.0 million reduction in term deposits.

Cash used in operations increased from $9.9 million in 2015, to $10.4 million in 2016, primarily due to higher withholding taxes paid on performance share units vested in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by the receipt of exploration tax credits.

Cash used to fund Donlin Gold and Galore Creek decreased by $1.3 million in 2016 due to the timing of Donlin Gold funding requirements for permitting.

Cash used in financing activities in 2015 included $15.8 million to repay the remaining convertible notes.

13 

Outstanding share data

As of September 27, 2016, the Company had 320,015,809 common shares issued and outstanding. Also as of September 27, the Company had outstanding 19,828,841 stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of C$4.50, 2,619,150 Performance Share Units and 286,847 Deferred Share Units. Upon exercise of the foregoing convertible securities, the Company would be required to issue a maximum of 24,044,413 common shares.

Item 3.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks, including currency, credit and interest rate risks.

Currency risk

We are exposed to financial risk related to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates. We operate in Canada and the United States and a portion of our expenses are incurred in Canadian dollars. A significant change in the currency exchange rate between the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar could have an effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

We have not hedged our exposure to currency fluctuations. At August 31, 2016, we are exposed to currency risk through our investment in the Galore Creek project, mineral properties, deferred income taxes and cash balances held in Canadian dollars.

Based on the above net exposures as at August 31, 2016, and assuming that all other variables remain constant, a $0.01 depreciation or appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would result in an increase/decrease of approximately $3.0 million in our consolidated comprehensive income (loss).

Credit risk

Concentration of credit risk exists with respect to our cash and cash equivalents and term deposit investments. All deposits are held through two large Canadian chartered banks with high investment-grade ratings and have maturities of less than one year.

Interest rate risk

The interest rate on the promissory note owed to Barrick Gold Corporation is variable with the U.S. prime rate. Based on the amount owing on the promissory note as at August 31, 2016, and assuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1% change in the U.S. prime rate would result in an increase/decrease of approximately $0.8 million in the interest accrued by us per annum.

Item 4.

Controls and Procedures

Management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of August 31, 2016. On the basis of this review, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The company s internal controls over financial reporting are based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
