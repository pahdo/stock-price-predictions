  Explanatory Note 
  On February 12, 2016, Q2 Holdings, Inc., or Q2, filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Original Report, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. This Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A amends the Original Report in order to amend  Item 9A Controls and Procedures  to (a) include management s report on internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 which was inadvertently excluded from the Original Report and (b) amend management's conclusions regarding the effectiveness of Q2's disclosure controls and procedures solely as a result of Q2's failure to include in the Original Report management s report on internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. This Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the date of the Original Report or modify or update any of the other disclosures contained therein in any way other than as required to reflect the amendments discussed above. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original Report and Q2 s other filings with the SEC. 

PART II 
    
  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   December 31, 2015  , the end of the period covered by the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based solely upon the reason specified in the Explanatory Note to this Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. Management has taken steps to ensure that future filings contain management s report on internal control over financial reporting. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Attestation of Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.  
    
  The Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm as we are an  emerging growth company  as of December 31, 2015, as defined in Jobs Act. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   December 31, 2015   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
    
  Limitations on Controls 
    
  Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above.  Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.  Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.  Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
