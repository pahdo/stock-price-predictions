CURAEGIS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

NOTE 1   THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION       
     
  CurAegis Technologies, Inc. ( CurAegis ,  the Company ) was incorporated as a New York business corporation on September 25, 1996 under the name Torvec, Inc. The Company s name was changed from Torvec, Inc. to CurAegis Technologies, Inc. in June 2016 in connection with the establishment of its two business divisions. The CURA division is engaged in the fatigue management business and the Aegis division is engaged in the power and hydraulic business.   
     
  The Company develops and markets advanced technologies in the areas of power, safety and wellness. The Company is focused on the commercialization of a wellness and safety system (the CURA system and the myCadian watch) and a uniquely designed hydraulic pump that will be smaller, lighter and more efficient than current technology. The Company has not had any significant revenue-producing operations.    
      
  The Company has created the CURA system to market products that reduce fatigue risk in the workplace and help individuals manage their sleep and improve alertness. The CURA system consists of the following capabilities:  

the myCadian watch and app,      

real-time alertness monitoring,     

the Group Wellness Index,     

the Z-Coach wellness program and     

a panic button and man-down system.     
     
  Our goal with the Aegis hydraulic pump technology is to bring to the marketplace a unique concept in hydraulic pumps and motors that will be:  

smaller and lighter than conventional pumps and motors,     

more efficient,     

as reliable,     

price competitive, and     

unique in its ability to scale larger, allowing more powerful pumps and motors.     
     
  It is important to note, regarding both the CURA and Aegis products, that the cycle time from the initiation of the sales process to revenue realization can be highly variable especially as a start-up entity. In addition to the activities to be undertaken to implement our plan of operations, we may expand and/or refocus our activities depending upon future circumstances and developments.   
     
    Management Plans   As of September 30, 2016, we have cash on hand of $1,069,000, working capital of $823,000, stockholders  equity of $1,200,000 and an accumulated deficit of $74,213,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we raised gross proceeds of $1,510,500 through the sale of our Series C-3 preferred stock and $995,000 through the issuance of 6% senior convertible notes and warrants. The proceeds from these private placements are being used to support the ongoing development and marketing of our core technologies and product initiatives.   
     
  On December 8, 2015, the Company commenced the offering of up to ten million shares of its Series C-3 Voting Convertible Preferred stock with an offering price of $0.25 per share in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The offering was made only to  accredited investors  as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The C-3 preferred stock offering expired on September 1, 2016.   
     
  On August 25, 2016 the Company commenced the sales of up to $3 million in 6% senior convertible notes and warrants in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The offering has been made only to  accredited investors  as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company closed on the sale of $995,000 of the senior convertible notes and warrants during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016.   
     
  Management will continue to use its best efforts to develop financing opportunities to fund the development and commercialization of the CURA and Aegis products. Management estimates that the 2016 cash needs, based on its current development and product plans, will be approximately $3.7 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents on hand may not be sufficient to cover the Company s future working capital requirements. The Company s ability to fund its current and future commitments out of its available cash depends on a number of factors. These factors include the Company s ability to (i) launch and generate sales from the CURA division and; (ii) decrease research and overhead expenses. If these and other factors are not met and if the Company cannot generate sufficient cash from its operations, the Company would need to raise additional funds in the future in order to fund its working capital needs and pursue its growth strategy. Although there can be no assurances, management believes that sources for these additional funds will be available through either current or future investors.    

6

Since inception, we have financed our operations by the sale of our securities and debt financings. We may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our working capital needs, to fund more aggressive expansion of our business, to complete development, testing and marketing of our products, or to make strategic acquisitions or investments. We may require additional equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or funds from other sources for these purposes. No assurance can be given that necessary funds will be available for us to finance our development on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, such additional financings may involve dilution of our shareholders or may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. In addition, we may experience operational difficulties and delays due to working capital restrictions. If adequate funds are not available from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay or scale back our growth plans.   

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       
       
    Basis of Presentation:     The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been included. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of what the results will be for the fiscal year. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 contained in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.   
         
    Consolidation:   The financial statements include the accounts of the Company, our wholly-owned subsidiary Iso-Torque Corporation, and our majority-owned subsidiary, Ice Surface Development, Inc. (56% owned at September 30, 2016). As of September 30, 2016, each of the subsidiaries is non-operational. The Company intends to let Ice Surface Development, Inc. dissolve by proclamation. All material intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.   
       
    Use of Estimates:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are subject to a high degree of judgment and potential change. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    
     
    Reclassifications:   Certain reclassifications may have been made to prior year balances to conform to the current year s presentation.  
       
    Cash and Cash Equivalents:   Cash and cash equivalents may include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions which periodically may exceed federally insured amounts. We have a corporate credit card program through our primary financial institution, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. In connection with this, the Company granted a security interest to the Bank in our premium commercial money market account to act as collateral for the activity within the corporate card program, up to $25,000.     
         
    Inventory  : Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the average cost method. We record provisions for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology developments or other economic factors. There was no provision for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
    Accounts Receivable  : We carry our accounts receivable at invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts.  On a periodic basis, we evaluate our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts, based on a history of past write-offs and collections and current credit conditions.  We do not accrue interest on past due invoices.  The allowance for doubtful accounts was zero at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

7

Software, Property and Equipment:   Capitalized software, property and equipment are stated at cost. Estimated useful lives are as follows:  

Software (in years)   

3   

Office equipment (in years)   
 
  5   
 
  -   
 
  7     

Leasehold improvements   
 
  lesser of useful life or lease term     

Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method. Betterments, renewals and significant repairs that extend the life of the assets are capitalized. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposition is recognized in other income (expense). Depreciation and software amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $45,000 and $27,000, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $129,000 and $85,000, respectively.  
     
  Whenever events or circumstances indicate, our long-lived assets including any intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment by using the estimated future cash flows directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use of the assets. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, impairment may be indicated. The carrying amount is compared to the estimated discounted cash flows and if there is an excess such amount is recorded as impairment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded no impairment charges.  
       
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments:   As defined by U.S. GAAP ,  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information is used to determine fair values. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:   
     
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  
  Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data  
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data   
     
  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) guidance for the disclosure about fair value of financial instruments requires disclosure of an estimate of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The fair value of financial instruments pursuant to FASB s guidance for the disclosure about fair value of financial instruments approximated their carrying values at September 30, 2016. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair value due to their short maturity. The carrying amount of capital lease obligations approximates fair value because stated or implied interest rates approximate current interest rates that are available for debt with similar terms.  
       
    Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue:   The Company began offering the Z-Coach aviation wellness program in the first quarter of 2016. The Z-Coach wellness program provides fatigue safety training over an annual subscription period of twelve months. The Z-Coach program allows the user unlimited access during the annual subscription period. Customers are billed at the acceptance of the subscription and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as our performance obligations are satisfied and when collection is reasonably assured. One customer accounted for 48% of total sales made during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and four other customers accounted for an aggregate of 30% of total sales during this period. Our collection terms provide customers standard terms of net 30 days. Future performance obligations are reflected in deferred revenue.   
     
    Research and Development and Patents:   Research and development costs and patent expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development includes personnel-related costs, materials and supplies, depreciation and consulting services.   

8

Patent costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $31,000 and $22,000, respectively, and are included in general and administrative expenses. Patent costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $55,000 and $69,000, respectively  
       
    Stock-based Compensation:   FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 718-10 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the service period (generally the vesting period) in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date. The impact of forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized. In addition, the realization of tax benefits in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes will be recognized as a financing activity in accordance with ASC 718-10.   
     
  No tax benefits were attributed to the stock-based compensation expense because a valuation allowance was maintained for substantially all net deferred tax assets.     
     
  FASB ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees,  requires all share-based payments to non-employees, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as compensation expense generally over the service period of the consulting arrangement or until performance conditions are expected to be met. Using a Black-Scholes valuation model, we periodically reassess the fair value of non-employee options until service conditions are met, which generally aligns with the vesting period of the options, and we adjust the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements accordingly.  
     
  FASB ASC 718-20 requires that modifications of the terms or conditions of equity awards be treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award.  Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified.  
     
    Income Taxes:   We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.    
     
  We account for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of tax benefits, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as general and administrative expenses. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  
       
    Loss per Common Share:   FASB s ASC 260-10 ( Earnings Per Share ) requires the presentation of basic earnings per share, which is based on weighted average common stock outstanding, and dilutive earnings per share, which gives effect to options, warrants and convertible securities in periods when they are dilutive. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, we excluded 60,268,000 and 54,172,000 potential common shares, respectively, relating to convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, options and warrants outstanding from the diluted net loss per common share calculation because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. In addition, we excluded 625,000 warrants from the diluted net loss per common share calculation at September 30, 2016 and 2015 as the conditions for their vesting are not time-based.    
      
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements:     
     
   FASB Accounting Pronouncements Related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.     
       
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  extending the date of implementation of this guidance for public companies to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  to provide guidance on the topic of principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers" to further clarify identifying performance obligations and licensing in Topic 606.  In May, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  to addressed narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients relative to certain aspects of Topic 606.  

9

These standards are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).  
     
  The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the adoption of FASB accounting pronouncements related to revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and has not yet determined the method by which we will adopt these standards.  
      
   Other FASB Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows:  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (topic 230).  There is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. This pronouncement addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.     The amendments are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326)  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  The pronouncement affects entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. This pronouncement will affect an entity to varying degrees depending on the credit quality of the assets held, their duration, and how the entity applies current GAAP. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends the current stock compensation guidance. The amendments simplify the accounting for the taxes related to stock based compensation, including adjustments as to how excess tax benefits and a company's payments for tax withholdings should be classified.

  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases,  a comprehensive new lease standard which will supersede previous lease guidance. The standard requires a lessee to recognize in its balance sheet assets and liabilities related to long-term leases that were classified as operating leases under previous guidance. An asset will be recognized related to the right to use the underlying asset and a liability will be recognized related to the obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease. The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding leases. The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and requires modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

The notes have an annual interest rate of 6% and a five-year maturity. The warrants have a fixed exercise price of $0.25 and a ten-year term from the date of issuance. The notes will be offered in a private placement exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Included in the 2016 assumptions above is the impact of 307,000 stock options, that were granted under the 2011 Plan, that will vest based on certain market conditions, specifically these options will fully vest upon the first day the trading price of the common stock of the Company shall be $5.00 per share.   
     
  The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury security rate in effect as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using the historical closing stock price. The expected life was generally determined using the simplified method as we do not believe we have sufficient historical stock option exercise experience on which to base the expected term.   
     
  The following summarizes the activity of all of our outstanding stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:   

As of September 30, 2016, the exercise prices of all outstanding stock options ranged from $.20 per share to $5.00 per share.

We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward-looking statements.  
       
    Overall Business Strategy     
     
  CurAegis Technologies, Inc. ( CurAegis ,  the Company ) was incorporated as a New York business corporation on September 25, 1996 under the name Torvec, Inc. The Company s name was changed from Torvec, Inc. to CurAegis Technologies, Inc. in June 2016 in connection with the establishment of its two business divisions. The CURA division is engaged in the fatigue management business, and the Aegis division is engaged in the power and hydraulic business.   
     
  The Company develops and markets advanced technologies in the areas of power, safety and wellness. The Company is focused on the commercialization of a wellness and safety system (the CURA system and the myCadian watch) and a uniquely designed hydraulic pump that will be smaller, lighter and more efficient than current technology. The Company has not had any significant revenue-producing operations.    
       
  The Company has created the CURA system to develop and market products that reduce fatigue risk in the workplace and help individuals manage their sleep and improve alertness. The CURA system will comprise the following:  

real-time alertness monitoring using the myCadian watch,      

panic button and man down system,     

CURA software,     

the Z-Coach wellness program and     

exercise and nutrition modules.     
     
  The Aegis hydraulic pump is an innovative hydraulic design, the goal of which is to deliver better efficiencies in a package that is smaller and lighter than existing technologies.   
     
  It is important to note, regarding both the CURA and Aegis products, that the cycle time from the initiation of the sales process to revenue realization can be highly variable especially for a start-up entity. In addition to the activities to be undertaken by us to implement our plan of operation detailed below, we may expand and/or refocus our marketing activities depending upon future circumstances and developments.   
     
  Information regarding the Company and all of our inventions, including regular updates on technological and business developments, can be found on our website www.curaegis.com. The website and its contents are not incorporated by reference into this report.  
     
    CURA Division: the CURA  System    
     
  The Company s CURA division is developing a proprietary technology and suite of products designed to (i) measure the decrease in a person s alertness and (ii) to train individuals on how to improve alertness levels. The CURA system and the myCadian watch will enable the user and third parties to anticipate and avert undesired or disastrous situations caused by the degradation of alertness. With the information provided from the CURA software analytics, employees can work with Z-Coach, our proprietary sleep training and education solution, to correct sleep issues and improve overall wellness.    
     
  CurAegis has engaged a number of sleep study experts and neurologists to assist with the analysis and validation of our new technologies. The Company believes a solutions approach can be created to indicate a  degradation of alertness  and thus give immediate and important information to the user and other parties. Action taken upon a warning of a change in alertness will lead to a better and safer environment. The myCadian watch paired with the CURA software is designed to be a real time alertness and emergency monitoring system that addresses sleep and fatigue management solutions. This is especially important when an individual s alertness is essential in properly performing tasks, fulfilling responsibilities and averting disasters.  The Company has filed for patent protection for these inventions.    

19

The myCadian watch is a wearable device developed using physiological monitoring hardware and our proprietary CURA (Circadian User Risk Assessment) software and is designed to detect a degradation of alertness in a user and reveal sleep and fatigue problems. The myCadian watch will contain an emergency notification function through the use of a panic button or in sensing a lack of motion would generate a third party panic notification. The CURA system will include:  

a proprietary tool that combines signal processing and pattern recognition to guide users and third parties about the alertness of the wearer,     

a risk assessment that identifies the degradation of alertness potentially affecting the wearer s ability to perform tasks,     

a comprehensive assessment for wellness, alertness and sleep,     

real-time reporting that distills complex data into actionable information on mobile and desktop platforms,      

predictive reporting for a user to take action when alertness begins to wane - before fatigue becomes dangerous,     

flexible settings to provide employers a customized tool within existing safety definitions and to create protocols for a unique environment and     

pricing that makes it affordable across a broad based workforce.      
     
  Management is developing marketing and sales programs in support of beta trials planned for the fourth quarter of 2016. The beta trials will include multiple industry instances in an active user program to compare and align the user experience with our product definitions and objectives.   
     
  The Company has invested in controlled clinical studies at the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder using scientifically validated studies. We have calibrated our proprietary technologies and algorithms to these studies. The Company is currently completing controlled studies at the University of Rochester Medical Center to validate the accuracy of myCadian data.  
     
  The Z-Coach e-learning tool is a critical component of the CURA system and was originally created by highly respected fatigue management scientists. We acquired the Z-Coach e-learning tool in September 2015. Z-Coach learning topics include: Risks and Costs of Fatigue, Fundamentals of Sleep, Fatigue Mitigation and Countermeasures. Z-Coach participants gain an awareness of the dangers inherent in the lack of sleep and learn to utilize lifestyle tools to make changes to improve their health, mood, productivity and safety. The first Z-Coach e-learning module, Z-Coach Aviation, has been designed for aviation professionals, from flight and ground crews, to scheduling, dispatch, administration and management. Z-Coach Aviation was first offered for sale in the first quarter of 2016.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed the design and development of the Z-Coach Pro module which will be marketed to a broad range of organizations for fatigue learning and mitigation. The Company is currently developing Z-Coach modules tailored to the trucking and busing industry, to first responders, 911 operations and other municipal employee groups as well as to medical industries. These industry-specific Z-Coach modules will be included in the launch of the CURA  system and the myCadian  watch.    
     
    Aegis Division: Hydraulic Pump    
  The development of our hydraulic pump has taken on added significance in light of U.S. government emissions regulations for off road diesel engines. To help achieve these standards, companies are attempting to run diesel engines, and their hydraulic pumps, at lower rotational speeds. This requires larger displacement hydraulic pumps to be installed to compensate for the decrease in rotational speed. Among other advantages, the Aegis hydraulic pump technology allows a larger displacement pump to fit into the same or smaller footprint than that of existing pumps. This enables manufacturers to keep the current equipment layout without the need for expensive modifications to accommodate larger hydraulic pumps.  
     
  Our goal with the Aegis hydraulic pump technology is to bring to the marketplace a revolutionary new concept in hydraulic pumps and motors that will be:  

smaller and lighter than conventional pumps and motors,     

more efficient,     

as reliable,     

price competitive, and     

unique in its ability to scale larger, allowing more powerful pumps and motors.     
     
  Since 2012, we have invested in software, test equipment and personnel to enhance our development efforts and begun a redesign of the hydraulic pump to improve the overall performance while maintaining the advantages we have in size and weight. We have built our own testing facility, which would have otherwise taken place at a third party testing facility. Our engineer and design team has progressively made adjustments to the valve sealing design and each change has resulted in an improvement in the measured efficiency of the pump. We have filed for patent protection for our novel non-rotating group pump concept, and we are also working on additional patents as a result of engineering breakthroughs in our design process.   

20

In the second quarter of 2016, the Company submitted the Aegis hydraulic pump for testing at the Fluid Power Institute at the Milwaukee School of Engineering ( MSOE ). The MSOE research laboratories provide custom in-depth testing, systems analysis solutions, and evaluations. The Aegis pump evaluated by MSOE was our test pump, not a production prototype, thus the tested unit was not completely optimized. The MSOE test results demonstrated that our pump can achieve the high speed and pressure levels needed and should result in greater efficiencies and power density than current axial piston hydraulic pumps in the market. We also believe the testing at MSOE confirmed our test stand accuracy and the mathematical models used in our design development. Our next steps will be to begin the manufacture of a production prototype in tandem with a potential customer thereby designing to a specific customer application. Management believes that the manufacture of a production prototype should be completed in 2017.  
     
    Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
     
  The Company recorded $14,000 in revenue during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016. There was no revenue earned during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company began offering the Z-Coach aviation wellness program in February of 2016. The Z-Coach wellness program provides fatigue safety training over an annual subscription period of twelve months. This allows the user unlimited access during the annual subscription period. Customers are billed at the acceptance of the subscription and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as our performance obligations are satisfied and when collection is reasonably assured.   
      
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold fifty-eight Z-Coach aviation subscriptions to four customers resulting in total customer sales of $12,000. In anticipation of the launch of the CURA system, the Company reduced the price of the Z-Coach subscription fees effective October 1, 2016. In connection with this pricing strategy, customers that are still within their initial subscription year will receive a credit against future purchases of Z-Coach or the CURA system measured at this lower pro-rated price. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified $26,000 from deferred revenue to other current liabilities in connection with this sales strategy. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has deferred revenue of $14,000 attributed to Z-Coach subscription revenue that will be recognized ratably over the next twelve months as our performance obligations are satisfied.   
     
  The Company recorded $35,000 in cost of revenue during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 attributed to the Z-Coach subscriptions reflecting software amortization of $30,000 and hosting fees of $6,000. Software amortization reflected in cost of revenue is based upon the straight line amortization of the capitalized software over is estimated useful life of 36 months. The Company has engaged a third party to provide hosting of the Z-Coach on-line subscriptions for the twelve-month period from February 2016 through January 2017. The Company has paid $22,500 to this provider and is recognizing hosting expense as a product cost over the twelve-month contract period.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we raised $1,510,500 through the sale of our Series C-3 preferred stock and $995,000 through the issuance of 6% senior convertible notes and warrants. The proceeds from these private placements are being used to support the ongoing development and marketing of our core technologies and product initiatives.   
     
  On December 8, 2015, the Company commenced the offering of up to ten million shares of its Series C-3 Voting Convertible Preferred stock with an offering price of $0.25 per share in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The offering was made only to  accredited investors  as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The C-3 preferred stock offering expired on September 1, 2016.

On August 25, 2016 the Company commenced the sales of up to $3 million in senior convertible notes and warrants in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The offering has been made only to  accredited investors  as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company closed on the sale of $995,000 of the senior convertible notes and warrants during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016.   
     
  Management will continue to use its best efforts to develop financing opportunities to fund the development and commercialization of the CURA and Aegis products. Management estimates that the 2016 cash needs, based on its current development and product plans, will be approximately $3.7 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents on hand may not be sufficient to cover the Company s future working capital requirements. The Company s ability to fund its current and future commitments out of its available cash depends on a number of factors. These factors include the Company s ability to (i) launch and generate sales from the CURA division and; (ii) decrease research and overhead expenses. If these and other factors are not met and if the Company cannot generate sufficient cash from its operations, the Company would need to raise additional funds in the future in order to fund its working capital needs and pursue its growth strategy. Although there can be no assurances, management believes that sources for these additional funds will be available through either current or future investors.    
     
  Since inception, we have financed our operations by the sale of our securities and debt financings. We may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our working capital needs, to fund more aggressive expansion of our business, to complete development, testing and marketing of our products, or to make strategic acquisitions or investments. We may require additional equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or funds from other sources for these purposes. No assurance can be given that necessary funds will be available for us to finance our development on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, such additional financings may involve dilution of our shareholders or may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. In addition, we may experience operational difficulties and delays due to working capital restrictions. If adequate funds are not available from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay or scale back our growth plans.   
     
    Critical Accounting Policies     
     
    Revenue Recognition        
  The Company began offering the Z-Coach aviation wellness program in the first quarter of 2016. The Z-Coach wellness program provides fatigue safety training over an annual subscription period of twelve months. The Z-Coach program allows the user unlimited access during the annual subscription period. Customers are billed at the acceptance of the subscription, and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as our performance obligations are satisfied and when collection is reasonably assured. Our collection terms provide customers standard terms of net 30 days. Future performance obligations are reflected in deferred revenue.   
     
    Income Taxes    
  We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.   
     
  We account for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of tax benefits, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as general and administrative expenses. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  
     
    Stock-Based Compensation        
  FASB ASC 718-10 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period) in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date. The impact of forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized. In addition, the realization of tax benefits in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes will be recognized as a financing activity in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10.    

24

No tax benefits were attributed to the stock-based compensation expense because a valuation allowance was maintained for substantially all net deferred tax assets. We elected to adopt the alternative method of calculating the historical pool of windfall tax benefits as permitted by FASB ASC 718-10-65 (previously known as FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 123(R)-c,  Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards ). This is a simplified method to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits that is used in determining the tax effects of stock compensation in the results of operations and cash flow reporting for awards that were outstanding as of the adoption of FASB ASC 718-10.   
      
  FASB ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees,  requires all share-based payments to non-employees, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements as compensation expense generally over the service period of the consulting arrangement or until performance conditions are expected to be met. Using a Black-Scholes valuation model, we periodically reassess the fair value of non-employee options until service conditions are met, which generally aligns with the vesting period of the options, and we adjust the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements accordingly.  
     
  FASB ASC 718-20 requires that modifications of the terms or conditions of equity awards be treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award.  Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified.   
     
    Safe Harbor    
  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements. This report contains certain forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. The statements contained in this report relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, future demand for our products and services, the successful commercialization of our products, general domestic and global economic conditions, government and environmental regulations, competition and customer strategies, changes in our business strategy or development plans, capital deployment, business disruptions, including those caused by fires, raw material supplies, technical failures, environmental regulations, and other risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements set forth herein. When used in this report, the words  anticipate ,  believe ,  estimate  or  expect  or words of similar import are intended to identify forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of the matters described above and other risks and uncertainties, see  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
