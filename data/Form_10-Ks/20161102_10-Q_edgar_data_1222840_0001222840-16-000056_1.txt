The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Readers of this Quarterly Report should refer to the audited financial statements of Retail Properties of America, Inc. for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in its   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, as certain footnote disclosures which would substantially duplicate those contained in the Annual Report have been omitted from this Quarterly Report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary, all of which were of normal recurring nature, for a fair presentation have been included in this Quarterly Report. 
   
  (1) ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Retail Properties of America, Inc. (the Company) was formed on March 5, 2003 and its primary purpose is to own and operate high quality, strategically located shopping centers in the United States. 
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The Company believes it qualifies for taxation as a REIT and, as such, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income, property or net worth and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. The Company has   one   wholly-owned subsidiary that has jointly elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS) and is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate tax rates. The income tax expense incurred by the TRS did not have a material impact on the Company s accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. For example, significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to useful lives of assets, capitalization of development costs, fair value measurements, provision for impairment, including estimates of holding periods, capitalization rates and discount rates (where applicable), provision for income taxes, recoverable amounts of receivables, deferred taxes and initial valuations and related amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles, particularly with respect to property acquisitions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  All share amounts and dollar amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are stated in thousands with the exception of per share amounts and per square foot amounts. 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, as well as all wholly-owned subsidiaries and any consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Wholly-owned subsidiaries generally consist of limited liability companies (LLCs), limited partnerships and statutory trusts. 
  The Company s property ownership as of   September 30, 2016   is summarized below: 
                     
    Wholly-owned 
      Retail operating properties (a) 
    174

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Refer to the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of its significant accounting policies. Except as disclosed below, there have been no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-02,   Consolidation  , which revised the consolidation guidance for all entities. The new standard modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs. The adoption of this pronouncement under the modified retrospective method did not have any effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as the Company did not have any VIEs as of January 1, 2016; however, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had acquired   three   properties through consolidated VIEs and, accordingly, applied the revised consolidation guidance. See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations  , which requires the acquirer in a business combination to recognize in the period any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period rather than retrospectively accounting for those adjustments. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have any effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern  , on January 1, 2016. The new standard requires a company s management to assess the entity s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued) and provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have any effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  , on January 1, 2016. The new standard allowed the Company to make an accounting policy election to account for share-based payment award forfeitures when they occur, which required a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption and resulted in an adjustment of   $17   to additional paid-in capital and accumulated distributions in excess of earnings as of January 1, 2016. 
  Other Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014 with subsequent updates issued in August 2015 and March, April and May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This new standard is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017, and will replace existing revenue recognition standards. The sale of investment property and any non-lease components contained within lease agreements will be required to follow the new standard; however, lease components of lease contracts will be excluded from this standard. This pronouncement allows either a full or a modified retrospective method of adoption. Expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding revenue recognition will be required for contracts that are subject to this guidance. The Company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements; however, it will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall  . This new standard is effective January 1, 2018 and will require companies to disclose the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost in accordance with the exit price notion and will no longer require disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used, including any changes, to estimate fair value. In addition, companies will be required to disclose all financial assets and financial liabilities grouped by 1) measurement category and 2) form of financial instrument. The Company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements; however, it will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . This new standard is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and will require lessees to recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset, initially measured at the present value of lease payments, for both operating and financing leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, lessees  
  
   7

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

will be permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize lease liabilities and lease assets. Under this new pronouncement, lessor accounting will be largely unchanged from existing GAAP. The pronouncement requires a modified retrospective method of adoption, with some optional practical expedients. Upon adoption, the Company will recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for operating leases where it is the lessee, such as ground leases and office and equipment leases. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance until it becomes effective. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses  . This new standard is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019, and replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. Financial assets that are measured at amortized cost will be required to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected with an allowance for credit losses deducted from the amortized cost basis. In addition, an entity must consider broader information in developing its expected credit loss estimate, including the use of forecasted information. Generally, the pronouncement requires a modified retrospective method of adoption. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance until it becomes effective. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows  . This new standard is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. Of the eight types of cash flows discussed in the new standard, the classification of debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs as financing outflows will impact the Company as these items are currently reflected as operating outflows. The pronouncement requires a retrospective transition method of adoption. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance until it becomes effective. 
   
  (3) ACQUISITIONS 
  The Company closed on the following acquisitions during the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016: 

(a) 
    These properties were acquired as a   two  -property portfolio. Merrifield Town Center II also contains   62,000   square feet of storage space for a total of   138,000   square feet. 
              (b) 
    In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company assumed mortgage debt with a principal balance of   $15,971   and an interest rate of   3.75%   that matures in 2031. 
              (c) 
    The Company acquired the fee interest in an existing wholly-owned multi-tenant retail operating property located in Chicago, Illinois, which was previously subject to a ground lease with a third party. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company reversed the straight-line ground rent liability of   $6,978  , which is reflected as  Gain on extinguishment of other liabilities  in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income. 
              (d) 
    The Company acquired the anchor space improvements, which were previously subject to a ground lease with the Company, in an existing wholly-owned multi-tenant retail operating property located in Woodinville, Washington.

The Company closed on the following acquisitions during the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2015: 

(a) 
    The Company acquired a parcel located at its Lake Worth Towne Crossing multi-tenant retail operating property. 
              (b) 
    The Company acquired a single-user outparcel located at its Southlake Town Square multi-tenant retail operating property that was subject to a ground lease with the Company prior to the transaction. 
     The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values, before prorations, the Company recorded in conjunction with the acquisitions discussed above: 

(a) 
    The weighted average amortization period for acquired lease intangible assets is   6 years   and   15 years   for acquisitions completed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (b) 
    The weighted average amortization period for acquired lease intangible liabilities is   11 years   and   21 years   for acquisitions completed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
     The above acquisitions were funded using a combination of available cash on hand, proceeds from dispositions and proceeds from the Company s unsecured revolving line of credit. Transaction costs totaling   $913   and   $1,297   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were expensed as incurred and are included in  General and administrative expenses  in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income. 
  Included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income from the properties acquired that were accounted for as business combinations are   $36,210   and   $41,169   in total revenues and   $7,760   and   $7,575   in net income attributable to common shareholders from the date of acquisition through   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts do not include the total revenue and net income attributable to common shareholders from the 2016 acquisitions of the anchor space improvements in Woodinville Plaza and the fee interest in Ashland   Roosevelt and the 2015 acquisition of a parcel at Lake Worth Towne Crossing as they have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. 
  Condensed Pro Forma Financial Information 
  The results of operations for the acquisitions accounted for as business combinations that were completed during the period, or after such period through the financial statement issuance date, for which financial information was available, are included in the following unaudited condensed pro forma financial information as if these acquisitions had been completed as of the beginning of the year prior to the acquisition date. The following unaudited condensed pro forma financial information is presented as if the 2016 acquisitions were completed as of January 1, 2015 and as if the 2015 acquisitions completed through the date the   September 30,

2015   financial statements were issued, were completed as of January 1, 2014. The results of operations associated with the 2016 acquisitions of the anchor space improvements in Woodinville Plaza and the fee interest in Ashland   Roosevelt and the 2015 acquisition of a parcel at Lake Worth Towne Crossing have not been adjusted in the pro forma presentation as they have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The results of operations associated with the 2015 acquisitions of the outparcels at Southlake Town Square on July 31, 2015 and Royal Oaks Village II on October 27, 2015 have not been adjusted in the pro forma presentation due to a lack of historical financial information. These pro forma results are for comparative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the Company s actual results of operations would have been had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. 
  The unaudited condensed pro forma financial information is as follows: 

Variable Interest Entities 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into agreements with a qualified intermediary related to Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges (1031 Exchanges). The Company loaned   $65,419  ,   $39,215   and   $23,522   to the VIEs to acquire Oak Brook Promenade, Tacoma South and Eastside, respectively. Each 1031 Exchange was completed during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Code, within   180   days after the acquisition date of the property that is the subject of such 1031 Exchange. At the completion of the 1031 Exchanges, the sole membership interests of the VIEs were assigned to the Company and the respective outstanding loans were extinguished, resulting in the entities being wholly owned by the Company and no longer considered VIEs. 
  Prior to the completion of the 1031 Exchanges, the Company was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as it had the ability to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impacted their economic performance and had all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the VIEs. No value or income was attributed to the noncontrolling interests. The assets of the VIEs consisted of the investment properties which were operated by the Company.

(4) DISPOSITIONS 
  The Company closed on the following dispositions during the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016: 

(a)

              (b) 
    The property was disposed of through a lender-directed sale in full satisfaction of the Company s   $94,353   mortgage obligation. Immediately prior to the disposition, the lender reduced the Company s loan obligation to   $75,000   which was assumed by the buyer in connection with the disposition. Along with the loan reduction, the lender received the balance of the restricted escrows that they held and the rights to unpaid accounts receivable and forgave accrued interest, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of   $13,653  . 
              (c) 
    Portfolio consists of the following properties: (i) Academy Sports   Houma, (ii) Academy Sports   Port Arthur, (iii) Academy Sports   San Antonio, (iv) CVS Pharmacy   Moore, (v) CVS Pharmacy   Saginaw and (vi) Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   Olean. At the closing of the disposition, proceeds of   $34,973   were temporarily restricted related to potential 1031 Exchanges. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the related 1031 Exchanges closed and the proceeds were released to the Company. 
              (d) 
    The terms of the disposition of Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   Canandaigua and Tim Horton Donut Shop were negotiated as a single transaction. 
              (e) 
    At the closing of the disposition, proceeds of   $5,383   were temporarily restricted related to a potential 1031 Exchange. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the related 1031 Exchange closed and the proceeds were released to the Company.

At the closing of the disposition, proceeds of   $2,549   were temporarily restricted related to a potential 1031 Exchange. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the related 1031 Exchange closed and the proceeds were released to the Company. The aggregate proceeds, net of closing costs, from the property dispositions and this additional transaction totaled   $307,355   with aggregate gains of   $97,737  .

The Company closed on the following dispositions during the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2015:

              (b) 
    The terms of the disposition of Trenton Crossing and McAllen Shopping Center were negotiated as a single transaction. 
     None of the dispositions completed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   qualified for discontinued operations treatment. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had entered into a contract to sell Walgreens   Northwoods, a   16,300   square foot single-user retail property located in Northwoods, Missouri. This property qualified for held for sale accounting treatment upon meeting all applicable GAAP criteria during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , at which time depreciation and amortization were ceased. As such, the assets and liabilities associated with this property are separately classified as held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . No properties qualified for held for sale accounting treatment as of December 31, 2015. 
  The following table presents the assets and liabilities associated with the investment property classified as held for sale:

(5) EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS 
  The Company s 2014 Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan, subject to certain conditions, authorizes the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other similar awards as well as cash-based awards to the Company s employees, non-employee directors, consultants and advisors in connection with compensation and incentive arrangements that may be established by the Company s board of directors or executive management. 
  The following table summarizes the Company s unvested restricted shares as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    Shares granted vest over periods ranging from   0.4 years   to   3.9 years   in accordance with the terms of applicable award agreements. 
              (b) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, the Company made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur. 
              (c) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted shares was   $4,120  , which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average term of   1.4 years  . 
     In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , performance restricted stock units (RSUs) were granted to the Company s executives. In 2019, following the performance period which concludes on December 31, 2018, one-third of the RSUs will convert into shares of common stock and two-thirds will convert into restricted shares with a   one year   vesting term. As long as the minimum hurdle is achieved and the executive remains employed during the performance period, the RSUs will convert into shares of common stock and restricted shares at a conversion rate of between   50%   and   200%   based upon the Company s Total Shareholder Return as compared to that of the peer companies within the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) Shopping Center Index for 2016 through 2018. If an executive terminates employment during the performance period by reason of a qualified termination, as defined in the agreement, only a prorated portion of his or her outstanding RSUs will be eligible for conversion based upon the period in which the executive was employed during the performance period. If an executive terminates for any reason other than a qualified termination during the performance period, he or she would forfeit his or her outstanding RSUs. In 2019, additional shares of common stock will also be issued in an amount equal to the accumulated value of the dividends that would have been paid during the performance period on the shares of common stock and restricted shares issued at the end of the performance period divided by the then-current market price of the Company s common stock. The Company calculated the grant date fair value per unit using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the probability of satisfying the market performance hurdles over the remainder of the performance period. Assumptions as of the grant dates included a weighted average risk-free interest rate of   0.89%  , the Company s historical common stock performance relative to the peer companies within the NAREIT Shopping Center Index and the Company s weighted average common stock dividend yield of   4.59%  . 
  The following table summarizes the Company s unvested RSUs as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was   $3,861  , which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average term of   2.7 years  .

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded compensation expense of   $1,594   and   $2,099  , respectively, related to unvested restricted shares and RSUs. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded compensation expense of   $5,296   and   $8,225  , respectively, related to unvested restricted shares and RSUs. Included within the compensation expense recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is compensation expense of   $1,680   related to the accelerated vesting of   134   restricted shares in conjunction with the departure of the Company s former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6,830  . 
  Prior to 2013, non-employee directors had been granted options to acquire shares under the Company s Third Amended and Restated Independent Director Stock Option and Incentive Plan. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase two shares were exercised and options to purchase   10   shares were forfeited. As of   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase   41   shares of common stock remained outstanding and exercisable. The Company did not grant any options in   2016   or   2015   and did not record any compensation expense related to stock options during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  (6) MORTGAGES PAYABLE 
  The following table summarizes the Company s mortgages payable: 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company disposed of The Gateway through a lender-directed sale in full satisfaction of its   $94,353   mortgage obligation, which had a fixed interest rate of   6.57%  . Immediately prior to the disposition, the lender reduced the Company s loan obligation to   $75,000   which was assumed by the buyer in connection with the disposition. Along with the loan reduction, the lender received the balance of the restricted escrows that they held and the rights to unpaid accounts receivable and forgave accrued interest, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of   $13,653  . In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repaid mortgages payable in the total amount of   $35,344   which had a weighted average fixed interest rate of   4.34%   and made scheduled principal payments of   $9,900   related to amortizing loans.   One   of the mortgages repaid, with a principal balance of   $7,750   at maturity, had been swapped to a fixed rate and the Company had guaranteed a portion of the outstanding balance. Upon repayment of the mortgage on its scheduled maturity date, the interest rate swap expired and the Company s guarantee was extinguished. The Company also assumed a mortgage payable with a principal balance of   $15,971   and an interest rate of   3.75%   that matures in 2031 in conjunction with the acquisition of The Shoppes at Union Hill. 
  The majority of the Company s mortgages payable require monthly payments of principal and interest, as well as reserves for real estate taxes and certain other costs. The Company s properties and the related tenant leases are pledged as collateral for its mortgages payable. At times, the Company has borrowed funds financed as part of a cross-collateralized package, with cross-default provisions. In those circumstances, one or more of the Company s properties may secure the debt of another of the Company s properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a pool of mortgages with a principal balance of   $391,436   that was cross-collateralized by the   48   properties in its IW JV 2009, LLC portfolio.

(b) 
    $250,000   of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based variable rate debt has been swapped to a fixed rate through   two   interest rate swaps. The swaps effectively convert   one-month floating rate LIBOR   to a weighted average fixed rate of   0.6677%   through December 31, 2017. 
               (d) 
    Total debt excludes capitalized loan fees of   $(11,919)  , net of accumulated amortization, as of   September 30, 2016   which are included as a reduction to the respective debt balances. The weighted average years to maturity of consolidated indebtedness was   4.8 years   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
      The Company plans on addressing its debt maturities through a combination of proceeds from asset dispositions, capital markets transactions and its unsecured revolving line of credit.

The indenture, as supplemented, governing the   4.00%   senior unsecured notes due 2025 (  4.00%   Notes Due 2025) (the Indenture) contains customary covenants and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Company is subject to various financial covenants, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum secured and total leverage ratios; (ii) a debt service coverage ratio; and (iii) maintenance of an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratio. 
  The note purchase agreement governing the   4.12%   senior unsecured notes due 2021 and the   4.58%   senior unsecured notes due 2024 (collectively, Notes Due 2021 and 2024) contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement, the Company is subject to various financial covenants, some of which are based upon the financial covenants in effect in the Company s primary credit facility, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum unencumbered, secured and consolidated leverage ratios; (ii) minimum interest coverage and unencumbered interest coverage ratios; and (iii) a minimum consolidated net worth. 
  The note purchase agreement governing the   4.08%   senior unsecured notes due 2026 and that will govern the   4.24%   senior unsecured notes due 2028 (collectively, Notes Due 2026 and 2028) contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement, the Company is subject to various financial covenants, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum unencumbered, secured and consolidated leverage ratios; (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iii) a fixed charge coverage ratio (as set forth in the Company s unsecured credit facility); and (iv) an unencumbered interest coverage ratio (as set forth in the Company s unsecured credit facility and the note purchase agreement governing the Notes Due 2021 and 2024). 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Indenture and the note purchase agreements. 
   
  (8) UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY 
  On January 6, 2016, the Company entered into its fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by KeyBank National Association serving as administrative agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as syndication agent to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating   $1,200,000  . The Company s unsecured credit facility consists of a   $750,000   unsecured revolving line of credit, a   $250,000   unsecured term loan and a   $200,000   unsecured term loan (collectively, the Company s Unsecured Credit Facility) and is priced on a leverage grid at a rate of   LIBOR   plus a credit spread. The Company received investment grade credit ratings from   two   rating agencies in 2014. In accordance with the unsecured credit agreement, the Company may elect to convert to an investment grade pricing grid. As of   September 30, 2016  , making such an election would have resulted in a higher interest rate and, as such, the Company has not made the election to convert to an investment grade pricing grid.

As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants and default provisions under the unsecured credit agreement. 
  The Company previously had a   $1,000,000   unsecured credit facility that consisted of a   $550,000   unsecured revolving line of credit and a   $450,000   unsecured term loan that bore interest at a rate of   LIBOR   plus a credit spread ranging from   1.45%   to   2.05%   and was scheduled to mature on May 12, 2017 for the unsecured revolving line of credit and May 11, 2018 for the unsecured term loan. 
   
  (9) DERIVATIVES 
  The Company s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements and add stability to interest expense. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  
  RETAIL PROPERTIES OF AMERICA, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company utilizes   two   interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable rate debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  and is reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable rate debt. Over the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional   $34   will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into the following   two   interest rate swaps which effectively convert   one-month floating rate LIBOR   to a fixed rate: 

The Company previously had a   $300,000   interest rate swap that matured on February 24, 2016. In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repaid a   $7,750   variable rate mortgage payable that had been swapped to a fixed rate. Upon repayment of the mortgage on its scheduled maturity date, the interest rate swap expired. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance of this variable rate mortgage was   $7,910  . 
  The following table summarizes the Company s interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk: 

The table below presents the estimated fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The valuation techniques utilized are described in Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

(10) EQUITY 
  In December 2015, the Company entered into a new at-the-market (ATM) equity program under which it may issue and sell shares of its Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to   $250,000  , from time to time. The 2015 ATM equity program supersedes the Company s previous   $200,000   ATM equity program which was in place from March 2013 through  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents

  (Unaudited) 

November 2015. Actual sales may depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of the Company s Class A common stock. Any net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of acquisitions and redevelopment activities and the repayment of debt, including the Company s Unsecured Credit Facility. The Company did not sell any shares under its ATM equity programs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had Class A common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to   $250,000   remaining available for sale under its ATM equity program. 
  In December 2015, the Company s board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of   $250,000   of shares of its Class A common stock. The shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price in absolute terms and in relation to the value of the Company s assets, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The common stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had not repurchased any shares under this program. 
   
  (11) EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  The following table summarizes the components used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS): 

(a) 
    Excludes   587   shares of unvested restricted common stock as of   September 30, 2016  , which equate to   596   and   657   shares, respectively, on a weighted average basis for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . These shares will continue to be excluded from the computation of basic EPS until contingencies are resolved and the shares are released. 
              (b) 
    Excludes   848   shares of unvested restricted common stock as of   September 30, 2015  , which equate to   818   and   760   shares, respectively, on a weighted average basis for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . These shares were excluded from the computation of basic EPS as the contingencies remained and the shares had not been released as of the end of the reporting period. 
               (d) 
    There were   391   RSUs eligible for future conversion following the performance periods as of   September 30, 2016   (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), which equate to   391   and   360   RSUs on a weighted average basis for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. These contingently issuable shares are included in diluted EPS based on the weighted average number of shares that would be outstanding during the period, if any, assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency periods.

(e) 
    There were   180   RSUs eligible for future conversion following the performance period as of   September 30, 2015  , which equate to   168   and   76   RSUs on a weighted average basis for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. These contingently issuable shares are included in diluted EPS based on the weighted average number of shares that would have been outstanding during the period, if any, assuming   September 30, 2015   was the end of the contingency period. 
      
  (12) PROVISION FOR IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company identified indicators of impairment at certain of its properties.

Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these instruments are described after the table. 

Derivatives:    The fair value of the derivative asset and derivative liability are determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected future cash flows of each derivative. This analysis utilizes observable market data including forward yield curves and implied volatilities to determine the market s expectation of the future cash flows of the variable component. The fixed and variable components of the derivative are then discounted using calculated discount factors developed based on the LIBOR swap rate and are aggregated to arrive at a single valuation for the period. The Company also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered any applicable credit enhancements. The Company s derivative instruments are further described in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents the Company s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   aggregated by the level within the fair value hierarchy in which those measurements fall. The table includes information related to properties remeasured to fair value during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , except for those properties sold prior to   September 30, 2016  . Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these assets are described after the table. 

(a) 
    Excludes impairment charges recorded on investment properties sold prior to September 30, 2016. 
              (b) 
    Represents the fair value of the Company s South Billings Center development property, which was not under active development during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The estimated fair value of South Billings Center was based upon the expected sales price from the executed sales contract, which was subsequently terminated, and determined to be a Level 2 input. 
              (c) 
    Represents the fair value of the Company s Saucon Valley Square investment property. The estimated fair value of Saucon Valley Square was determined using the income approach. The income approach involves discounting the estimated income stream and reversion (presumed sale) value of a property over an estimated holding period to a present value at a risk-adjusted rate. Discount rates, growth assumptions and terminal capitalization rates utilized in this approach are derived from property-specific information, market transactions and other financial and industry data. The terminal capitalization rate and discount rate are significant inputs to this valuation. The following are the key Level 3 inputs used in estimating the fair value of Saucon Valley Square as of   September 30, 2016  , the date the asset was measured at fair value: 

Saucon Valley Square 
      Rental growth rates 
      
    Varies (i) 
      Operating expense growth rate 
      
    3.10% 
      Discount rate 
      
    9.35% 
      Terminal capitalization rate 
      
    8.35% 

(i) 
    Since cash flow models are established at the tenant level, projected rental revenue growth rates fluctuate over the course of the estimated holding period based upon the timing of lease rollover, amount of available space and other property and space-specific factors. 
     The Company did not have any assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2015. 
  Fair Value Disclosures 
  The following table presents the Company s financial liabilities, which are measured at fair value for disclosure purposes, by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these instruments are described after the table.

Mortgages payable, net:    The Company estimates the fair value of its mortgages payable by discounting the anticipated future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to the Company by its lenders for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. The rates used are not directly observable in the marketplace and judgment is used in determining the appropriate rate for each of the Company s individual mortgages payable based upon the specific terms of the agreement, including the term to maturity, the quality and nature of the underlying property and its leverage ratio. The rates used range from   2.5%   to   3.8%   and   2.2%   to   6.0%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Unsecured notes payable, net:    The quoted market price as of   September 30, 2016   was used to value the Company s   4.00%   Notes Due 2025. The Company estimates the fair value of its Notes Due 2021 and 2024 and Notes Due 2026 by discounting the future cash flows at rates currently offered to the Company by its lenders for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. The rates used are not directly observable in the marketplace and judgment is used in determining the appropriate rates. The weighted average rates used were   3.61%   and   4.64%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Unsecured term loans, net:    The Company estimates the fair value of its unsecured term loans, net by discounting the anticipated future cash flows related to the credit spreads at rates currently offered to the Company by its lenders for similar instruments of comparable maturities. The rates used are not directly observable in the marketplace and judgment is used in determining the appropriate rates. The weighted average rates used to discount the credit spreads were   1.37%   and   1.30%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Unsecured revolving line of credit:    The Company estimates the fair value of its unsecured revolving line of credit by discounting the anticipated future cash flows related to the credit spreads at rates currently offered to the Company by its lenders for similar facilities of comparable maturity. The rates used are not directly observable in the marketplace and judgment is used in determining the appropriate rates. The rate used to discount the credit spread was   1.35%   as of   December 31, 2015  . There were no amounts drawn on the unsecured revolving line of credit as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  There were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  (14) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had letter(s) of credit outstanding totaling   $143   which serve as collateral for certain capital improvements at   one   of its properties and reduce the available borrowings on its unsecured revolving line of credit. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   one   active redevelopment at Reisterstown Road Plaza located in Baltimore, Maryland. The Company estimates that it will incur net costs of approximately   $11,000   to   $12,000   related to the redevelopment, of which   $610   has been incurred as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  (15) LITIGATION 
  The Company is subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the resolution of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on currently available information, that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  (16) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  On October 24, 2016, the Company s board of directors (Board) increased the number of directors comprising the Board from   eight   to   nine   and appointed Robert G. Gifford as a Director of the Company, effective immediately, to serve until the Company s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.

Company Highlights     Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016 
  Acquisitions 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we continued to execute our investment strategy by acquiring six multi-tenant retail operating properties, the fee interest in an existing wholly-owned multi-tenant retail operating property and the anchor space improvements in an existing wholly-owned multi-tenant retail operating property for a total purchase price of   $283,337  . 
  The following table summarizes our acquisitions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    These properties were acquired as a two-property portfolio. Merrifield Town Center II also contains 62,000 square feet of storage space for a total of 138,000 square feet. 
              (b) 
    In conjunction with the acquisition, we assumed mortgage debt with a principal balance of $15,971 and an interest rate of 3.75% that matures in 2031. 
              (c) 
    We acquired the fee interest in an existing wholly-owned multi-tenant retail operating property located in Chicago, Illinois, which was previously subject to a ground lease with a third party. In conjunction with this transaction, we reversed the straight-line ground rent liability of $6,978, which is reflected as  Gain on extinguishment of other liabilities  in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income. 
              (d) 
    We acquired the anchor space improvements, which were previously subject to a ground lease with us, in an existing wholly-owned multi-tenant retail operating property located in Woodinville, Washington. 
     In total for   2016  , we expect to acquire approximately $400,000 to $450,000 of strategic acquisitions in our target markets, some of which have been, and some of which may be, structured as Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges (1031 Exchanges). 
  Dispositions 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we continued to pursue targeted dispositions of select non-target and single-user properties. Consideration from dispositions totaled   $390,682   and included the sales of seven multi-tenant retail operating properties aggregating 1,935,400 square feet for total consideration of $293,975 and 21 single-user retail properties aggregating 448,900 square feet for total consideration of $96,707.

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes our dispositions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    The property was disposed of through a lender-directed sale in full satisfaction of our $94,353 mortgage obligation. Immediately prior to the disposition, the lender reduced our loan obligation to $75,000 which was assumed by the buyer in connection with the disposition. Along with the loan reduction, the lender received the balance of the restricted escrows that they held and the rights to unpaid accounts receivable and forgave accrued interest, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $13,653. 
              (b) 
    Portfolio consists of the following properties: (i) Academy Sports   Houma, (ii) Academy Sports   Port Arthur, (iii) Academy Sports   San Antonio, (iv) CVS Pharmacy   Moore, (v) CVS Pharmacy   Saginaw and (vi) Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   Olean. At the closing of the disposition, proceeds of $34,973 were temporarily restricted related to potential 1031 Exchanges. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the related 1031 Exchanges closed and the proceeds were released to us. 
              (c) 
    The terms of the disposition of Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   Canandaigua and Tim Horton Donut Shop were negotiated as a single transaction. 
              (d) 
    At the closing of the disposition, proceeds of $5,383 were temporarily restricted related to a potential 1031 Exchange. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the related 1031 Exchange closed and the proceeds were released to us. 
              (e) 
    Portfolio consists of the following properties: (i) Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   Cheektowaga, (ii) Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   W. Main St., Batavia, (iii) Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   Union Rd., West Seneca and (iv) Rite Aid Store (Eckerd)   Greece. 
     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we also disposed of an outparcel for consideration of $2,639. At the closing of the disposition, proceeds of $2,549 were temporarily restricted related to a potential 1031 Exchange. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the related 1031 Exchange closed and the proceeds were released to us. 
  In total for   2016  , we continue to expect targeted dispositions to be approximately $600,000 to $700,000, some of which have been, and some of which may be, structured as 1031 Exchanges.

Market Summary 
  As a result of our capital recycling efforts over the past several years, we increased the amount of annualized base rent (ABR) in our target markets to   64.6%   of our total multi-tenant retail ABR. The following table summarizes our operating portfolio by market as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    Excludes $8,257 of multi-tenant retail ABR and 740 square feet of multi-tenant retail GLA attributable to our active redevelopment, which is located in the Washington, D.C./Baltimore MSA. Including these amounts, 65.3% of our multi-tenant retail ABR and 58.1% of our multi-tenant retail GLA is located in Target Markets. 
              (b) 
    Excludes one single-user retail operating property classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . 
     Leasing Activity 
  The following table summarizes the leasing activity in our retail operating portfolio during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Leases with terms of less than 12 months have been excluded from the table. 

(a) 
    Total excludes the impact of Non-Comparable New and Renewal Leases. 
              (b) 
    Excluding the impact from eight Rite Aid leases executed in the first quarter that were extended to effectuate the planned 2016 disposition of these single-user assets, all of which were sold during the second and third quarters, combined comparable re-leasing spreads were  
     
   28 

     Table of Contents  

approximately 8.1% and comparable renewal re-leasing spreads were approximately 7.7% over previous rental rates for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
           (c) 
    Includes (i) leases signed on units that were vacant for over 12 months, (ii) leases signed without fixed rental payments and (iii) leases signed where the previous and the current lease do not have a consistent lease structure. 
     Regarding an update on The Sports Authority, Inc. (Sports Authority) bankruptcy proceedings, nine of the 10 leases we had at the beginning of the year have been rejected and one has been assumed by Dick s Sporting Goods, Inc. During the third quarter of 2016, we signed leases to backfill two of the nine locations. Despite the disruption from these vacancies, our retail portfolio anchor percent leased, including leases signed was 96.9% as of September 30, 2016. Given the continued strength of our portfolio, we plan to remain strategic as we pursue opportunities to upgrade our tenancy and ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers at our properties. We anticipate that the majority of new leasing activity, based on ABR, for the remainder of 2016 will be attributable to the remaining vacant Sports Authority locations and small shop tenants. The small shop leases are generally expected to be non-comparable in nature as the leased space is more likely to have been vacant for longer than 12 months. 
  The lease at our one remaining office asset is scheduled to expire on November 30, 2016. We continue to focus on leasing the pending vacant space and have signed one lease to backfill 309,000 square feet of the 895,000 square foot property. 
  Capital Markets 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we: 
              
    entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,200,000, consisting of a $750,000 unsecured revolving line of credit and two unsecured term loans totaling $450,000 (collectively, our Unsecured Credit Facility); 
                
    disposed of The Gateway through a lender-directed sale in full satisfaction of our $94,353 mortgage obligation; 
                
    repaid $100,000, net of borrowings, on our unsecured revolving line of credit; 
                 
    as discussed above, assumed a mortgage payable with a principal balance of $15,971 and an interest rate of 3.75% that matures in 2031 in conjunction with the acquisition of The Shoppes at Union Hill; and 
                
    repaid mortgages payable totaling $35,344 and made scheduled principal payments of $9,900 related to amortizing loans. One of the mortgages repaid, with a principal balance of $7,750 at maturity, had been swapped to a fixed rate and we had guaranteed a portion of the outstanding balance. Upon repayment of the mortgage on its scheduled maturity date, the interest rate swap expired and our guarantee was extinguished. 
     Distributions 
  We declared quarterly distributions totaling $1.3125 per share of preferred stock and quarterly distributions totaling $0.496875 per share of common stock during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of Results for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 

Net income attributable to common shareholders decreased   $5,835   from   $75,967   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $70,132   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of the following: 
              
    a $4,573 increase in provision for impairment of investment properties. Based on the results of our evaluations for impairment (see Notes 12 and 13 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), we recognized impairment charges of $4,742 and $169 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; 
                
    a $3,892 increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the write-off of assets taken out of service at a redevelopment property during the three months ended September 30, 2016; 
                
    a $3,570 decrease in other property income primarily as a result of a decrease in lease termination fee income from our same store portfolio; and 
                
    a   $3,088   decrease in rental income primarily consisting of: 
                
    a $4,033 decrease in base rent primarily from the operating properties sold or held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   and our redevelopment properties, partially offset by an increase from the properties acquired after June 30, 2015 and our same store portfolio; 
     partially offset by 
             
    a $936 increase in amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles primarily from the properties acquired after June 30, 2015;

partially offset by 
             
    a   $14,823   decrease in interest expense primarily consisting of: 
                
    a $10,136 decrease in prepayment penalties and defeasance premiums; and

    a $3,709 decrease in operating expenses and real estate taxes, net of tenant recovery income, primarily as a result of our same store portfolio and the operating properties sold or held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . 
     Net operating income (NOI) 
  We define NOI as all revenues other than straight-line rental income, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and lease termination fee income, less real estate taxes and all operating expenses other than straight-line ground rent expense and amortization of acquired ground lease intangibles, which are non-cash items. NOI consists of same store NOI (Same Store NOI) and NOI from other investment properties (NOI from Other Investment Properties). We believe that NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties, which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide an additional and useful operating perspective not immediately apparent from  Operating income  or  Net income attributable to common shareholders  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We use these measures to evaluate our performance on a property-by-property basis because they allow management to evaluate the impact that factors such as lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our operating results. NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties do not represent alternatives to  Net income  or  Net income attributable to common shareholders  in accordance with GAAP as indicators of our financial performance. Comparison of our presentation of NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs. For reference and as an aid in understanding our computation of NOI, a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders as computed in accordance with GAAP to Same Store NOI has been presented for each comparable period presented. 
  Same store portfolio   quarter 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our same store portfolio consisted of   164   retail operating properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized prior to July 1, 2015. The number of properties in our same store portfolio decreased to   164   as of   September 30, 2016   from 172 as of June 30, 2016 as a result of the following: 
             
    the removal of nine same store investment properties sold during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ; and 
                
    the removal of one same store investment property classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  ; 
     partially offset by 
             
    the addition of two investment properties acquired during the second quarter of 2015. 
     The sales of Broadway Shopping Center on July 8, 2016, Mid-Hudson Center on July 21, 2016 and Alison s Corner on August 4, 2016 did not impact the number of same store properties as they were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016. 
  The properties and financial results reported in  Other investment properties  primarily include the following: 
              
    our development property; 
                
    our one remaining office property; 
                
    three properties where we have begun redevelopment and/or activities in anticipation of future redevelopment;

Same Store NOI increased   $3,992  , or   4.6%  , primarily due to the following: 
             
    base rent increased   $2,170   primarily due to an increase of $1,037 from occupancy growth, $830 from contractual rent changes and $647 from re-leasing spreads, partially offset by a decrease of $143 primarily from percentage and specialty rent; and 
                
    property operating expenses, bad debt expense and real estate taxes, net of tenant recovery income, decreased $2,043 primarily as a result of decreases in net recoverable property operating expenses, net real estate taxes resulting from lower than anticipated real estate tax assessments and the receipt of real estate tax refunds, non-recoverable property operating expenses and bad debt expense.

Same Store NOI increased   $8,964  , or   3.6%  , primarily due to the following: 
              
    property operating expenses, bad debt expense and real estate taxes, net of tenant recovery income, decreased $3,591 primarily as a result of decreases in non-recoverable property operating expenses, bad debt expense, net recoverable property operating expenses, and net real estate taxes resulting from lower than anticipated real estate tax assessments and the receipt of real estate tax refunds. 
      
  Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders 
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a financial measure known as funds from operations (FFO). As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real estate. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our computation of FFO attributable to common shareholders. Management believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO attributable to common shareholders provides a basis for comparing our performance and operations to those of other REITs. 
  We define Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders as FFO attributable to common shareholders excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which we do not consider representative of the comparable operating results of our real estate operating portfolio, which is our core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating transactions and other events include, but are not limited to, the financial statement impact of gains or losses associated with the early extinguishment of debt or other liabilities, impairment charges to write down the carrying value of assets other than depreciable real estate, actual or anticipated settlement of litigation involving the Company and executive and realignment separation charges, which are otherwise excluded from our calculation of FFO attributable to common shareholders. 
  We believe that FFO attributable to common shareholders and Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders, which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide an additional and useful means to assess the operating performance of REITs. FFO attributable to common shareholders and Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders do not represent alternatives to (i)  Net Income  or  Net income attributable to common shareholders  as indicators of our financial performance, or (ii)  Cash flows from operating activities  in accordance with GAAP as measures of our capacity to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends. Comparison of our presentation of Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We anticipate that cash flows from the below-listed sources will provide adequate capital for the next 12 months and beyond for all scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, including maturing debt, current and anticipated tenant allowances or other capital obligations, the shareholder distributions required to maintain our REIT status and compliance with the financial covenants of our Unsecured Credit Facility and our unsecured notes.

Repurchases of our common stock 

We have made substantial progress over the last several years in strengthening our balance sheet and addressing debt maturities funded primarily through asset dispositions and capital markets transactions, including public offerings of our common stock and preferred stock and private and public offerings of senior unsecured notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2,865   of scheduled principal amortization related to longer-dated maturities through the end of   2016  , which we plan on satisfying through a combination of proceeds from asset dispositions, capital markets transactions and our unsecured revolving line of credit.

The table below summarizes our consolidated indebtedness as of   September 30, 2016  :

    Fixed rate mortgages payable excludes mortgage premium of   $1,544  , discount of   $(633)   and capitalized loan fees of   $(5,701)  , net of accumulated amortization, as of   September 30, 2016  . Unsecured notes payable excludes discount of   $(1,001)   and capitalized loan fees of   $(3,520)  , net of accumulated amortization, as of   September 30, 2016  . Term loans exclude capitalized loan fees of   $(2,698)  , net of accumulated amortization, as of   September 30, 2016  . Capitalized loan fees related to the revolving line of credit are included in  Other assets, net  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
                (d) 
    We have two one year extension options on the term loan due 2018 and two six-month extension options on the revolving line of credit, which we may exercise as long as we are in compliance with the terms of the unsecured credit agreement and we pay an extension fee equal to 0.15% for the term loan and 0.075% of the commitment amount being extended for the revolving line of credit. 
     Mortgages Payable 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we disposed of The Gateway through a lender-directed sale in full satisfaction of our $94,353 mortgage obligation, which had a fixed interest rate of 6.57%. Immediately prior to the disposition, the lender reduced our loan obligation to $75,000 which was assumed by the buyer in connection with the disposition. Along with the loan reduction, the lender received the balance of the restricted escrows that they held and the rights to unpaid accounts receivable and forgave accrued interest, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $13,653. In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repaid mortgages payable in the total amount of   $35,344   which had a weighted average fixed interest rate of   4.34%   and made scheduled principal payments of   $9,900   related to amortizing loans. One of the mortgages repaid, with a principal balance of $7,750 at maturity, had been swapped to a fixed rate and we had guaranteed a portion of the outstanding balance. Upon repayment of the mortgage on its scheduled maturity date, the interest rate swap expired and our guarantee was extinguished. We also assumed a mortgage payable with a principal balance of $15,971 and an interest rate of 3.75% that matures in 2031 in conjunction with the acquisition of The Shoppes at Union Hill. 
  Unsecured Notes Payable 
  On September 30, 2016, we issued $100,000 of 10-year 4.08% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (Notes Due 2026) in a private placement transaction pursuant to a note purchase agreement we entered into with certain institutional investors on September 30, 2016. The proceeds were used to pay down our unsecured revolving line of credit and for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the same note purchase agreement, we also expect to issue $100,000 of 12-year 4.24% senior unsecured notes on December 28, 2016 (Notes Due 2028 and, collectively, Notes Due 2026 and 2028). On March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $250,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% Notes Due 2025. The 4.00% Notes Due 2025 were priced at 99.526% of  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

the principal amount to yield 4.058% to maturity. In addition, on June 30, 2014, we completed a private placement of $250,000 of unsecured notes, consisting of $100,000 of 4.12% senior unsecured notes due 2021 and $150,000 of 4.58% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (collectively, Notes Due 2021 and 2024). The proceeds from the 4.00% Notes Due 2025 and the Notes Due 2021 and 2024 were used to repay a portion of our unsecured revolving line of credit. 
  The note purchase agreement governing the Notes Due 2026 and 2028 contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement, we are subject to various financial covenants, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum unencumbered, secured and consolidated leverage ratios; (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iii) a fixed charge coverage ratio (as set forth in our unsecured credit facility); and (iv) an unencumbered interest coverage ratio (as set forth in our unsecured credit facility and the note purchase agreement governing the Notes Due 2021 and 2024). 
  The indenture, as supplemented, governing the 4.00% Notes Due 2025 (the Indenture) contains customary covenants and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we are subject to various financial covenants, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum secured and total leverage ratios; (ii) a debt service coverage ratio; and (iii) maintenance of an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratio. 
  The note purchase agreement governing the Notes Due 2021 and 2024 contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement, we are subject to various financial covenants, some of which are based upon the financial covenants in effect in our primary credit facility, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum unencumbered, secured and consolidated leverage ratios; (ii) minimum interest coverage and unencumbered interest coverage ratios; and (iii) a minimum consolidated net worth. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Indenture and the note purchase agreements. 
  Unsecured Credit Facility 
  On January 6, 2016, we entered into our fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by KeyBank National Association serving as administrative agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as syndication agent to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,200,000, or our Unsecured Credit Facility. Our Unsecured Credit Facility consists of a $750,000 unsecured revolving line of credit, a $250,000 unsecured term loan and a $200,000 unsecured term loan and is priced on a leverage grid at a rate of LIBOR plus a credit spread. We received investment grade credit ratings from two rating agencies in 2014. In accordance with the unsecured credit agreement, we may elect to convert to an investment grade pricing grid. As of   September 30, 2016  , making such an election would have resulted in a higher interest rate and, as such, we have not made the election to convert to an investment grade pricing grid. 
  The following table summarizes the key terms of our Unsecured Credit Facility: 

Our Unsecured Credit Facility has a $400,000 accordion option that allows us, at our election, to increase the total credit facility up to $1,600,000, subject to (i) customary fees and conditions including, but not limited to, the absence of an event of default as defined in the agreement and (ii) our ability to obtain additional lender commitments. 
  The fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, and events of default. Pursuant to the terms of the fourth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement, we are subject to various financial covenants, including the requirement to maintain the following: (i) maximum unencumbered, secured and consolidated leverage ratios; and (ii) minimum fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes we were in compliance with the financial covenants and default provisions under the unsecured credit agreement. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had letter(s) of credit outstanding totaling   $143   which serve as collateral for certain capital improvements at one of our properties and reduce the available borrowings on our unsecured revolving line of credit.

Debt Maturities 
  The following table shows the scheduled maturities and principal amortization of our indebtedness as of   September 30, 2016   for the remainder of   2016  , each of the next four years and thereafter and the weighted average interest rates by year, as well as the fair value of our indebtedness as of   September 30, 2016  . The table does not reflect the impact of any debt activity that occurred after   September 30, 2016  . 

(b) 
    $250,000 of LIBOR-based variable rate debt has been swapped to a fixed rate through two interest rate swaps. The swaps effectively convert one-month floating rate LIBOR to a weighted average fixed rate of 0.6677% through December 31, 2017. 
        We plan on addressing our debt maturities through a combination of proceeds from asset dispositions, capital markets transactions and our unsecured revolving line of credit. 
  Distributions and Equity Transactions 
  Our distributions of current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes are taxable to shareholders, generally, as ordinary income. Distributions in excess of these earnings and profits generally are treated as a non-taxable reduction of the shareholders  basis in the shares to the extent thereof (non-dividend distributions) and thereafter as taxable gain. We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) generally requires that a REIT annually distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. The Code imposes tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income. 
  To satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income and excise tax, we intend to make regular quarterly distributions of all, or substantially all, of our taxable income to shareholders. Our future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors. When determining the amount of future distributions, we expect to consider, among other factors, (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities, (ii) our expectations of future cash flow, (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for debt repayments, acquisitions of new properties, redevelopment opportunities and existing or future share repurchases, (iv) the timing of significant re-leasing activities and the establishment of  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

additional cash reserves for anticipated tenant allowances and general property capital improvements, (v) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, (vi) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT and to reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, (vii) the amount required to declare and pay in cash, or set aside for the payment of, the dividends on our Series A preferred stock for all past dividend periods and (viii) the requirement contained in our Unsecured Credit Facility to distribute at least an amount necessary to maintain our qualification. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distribution in order to meet the REIT distribution requirements. 
  In December 2015, we entered into a new at-the-market (ATM) equity program under which we may issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000, from time to time. The 2015 ATM equity program supersedes our previous   $200,000   ATM equity program which was in place from March 2013 through November 2015. Actual sales may depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of our Class A common stock. Any net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of acquisitions and redevelopment activities and the repayment of debt, including our Unsecured Credit Facility. We did not sell any shares under our ATM equity program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had Class A common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000 remaining available for sale under our ATM equity program. 
  In December 2015, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $250,000 of shares of our Class A common stock. The shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price in absolute terms and in relation to the value of our assets, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The common stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had not repurchased any shares under this program. 
  Capital Expenditures and Redevelopment Activity 
  We anticipate that obligations related to capital improvements, including expansions and pad developments, at our operating properties in   2016   can be met with cash flows from operations and working capital. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned one development property, South Billings Center located in Billings, Montana, with a carrying value of $3,000 which was not under active development. We began active redevelopment at Reisterstown Road Plaza, located in Baltimore, Maryland, in the third quarter of 2016. We anticipate stabilization in 2017 and estimate that we will incur net costs of approximately $11,000 to $12,000 related to the redevelopment, of which $610 has been incurred as of   September 30, 2016  . We anticipate funding the redevelopment with cash flows from operations, working capital and proceeds from our unsecured revolving line of credit. 
  Dispositions 
  We continue to execute our long-term portfolio repositioning strategy of disposing of select non-target and single-user properties. The following table highlights our property dispositions during   2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    Represents total consideration net of transaction costs. 2015 dispositions include the disposition of two development properties, one of which had been held in a consolidated joint venture. 
              (b) 
    Represents The Gateway s outstanding mortgage payable prior to the lender-directed sale of the property. Immediately prior to the disposition, the lender reduced our loan obligation to $75,000 which was assumed by the buyer in connection with the disposition. Along with the loan reduction, the lender received the balance of the restricted escrows that they held and the rights to unpaid accounts receivable and forgave accrued interest, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $13,653. 
              (c) 
    Excludes $95,881 of mortgages payable repayments or defeasances completed prior to disposition of the respective property for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
     In addition to the transactions presented in the preceding table, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received net proceeds of $2,549 from the sale of an outparcel at one of our properties. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we received net proceeds of $300 from condemnation awards.

    2016 acquisitions include the purchase of the fee interest in our Ashland   Roosevelt multi-tenant retail operating property that was previously subject to a ground lease with a third party and the anchor space improvements in our Woodinville Plaza multi-tenant retail operating property that was previously subject to a ground lease with us. The total number of properties in our portfolio was not affected by these transactions. 
              (b) 
    2015 acquisitions include the purchase of the following: 1) a land parcel at our Lake Worth Towne Crossing multi-tenant retail operating property, 2) a single-user outparcel located at our Southlake Town Square multi-tenant retail operating property that was subject to a ground lease with us prior to the transaction, and 3) a single-user outparcel located at our Royal Oaks Village II multi-tenant retail operating property. The total number of properties in our portfolio was not affected by these transactions.

  Cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of net income from property operations, adjusted for the following, among others: (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) provision for impairment of investment properties, (iii) gain on sales of investment properties, (iv) gain on extinguishment of debt, and (v) gain on extinguishment of other liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $4,068   primarily due to the following: 
               
    a $1,579 increase in cash paid for leasing fees and inducements; and 
                
    ordinary course fluctuations in working capital accounts; 
     partially offset by 
   Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the sales of investment properties, net of cash paid to purchase investment properties and to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and developments in progress, in addition to changes in restricted escrows. Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $19,738   primarily due to the following: 
   partially offset by

     Table of Contents  

an $87,852 decrease in proceeds from the sales of investment properties; and 
      We will continue to execute our investment strategy by pursuing targeted dispositions. The majority of the proceeds from disposition activity for the remainder of 2016 is expected to be used to acquire high quality, multi-tenant retail assets within our target markets, repay debt or potentially repurchase our common stock. In addition, tenant improvement costs associated with re-leasing vacant space may continue to be significant. 
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of proceeds from our Unsecured Credit Facility and the issuance of debt instruments, partially offset by distribution payments, repayments of our Unsecured Credit Facility, principal payments on mortgages payable and the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities in connection with defeasance of mortgages payable. Net cash used in financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $2,269   primarily due to the following: 
               
    a $4,149 increase in the payment of loan fees and deposits; 
     partially offset by 
              
    an $81,547 decrease in the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities in connection with defeasance of mortgages payable during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
     We plan to continue to address our debt maturities through a combination of proceeds from asset dispositions, capital markets transactions and our unsecured revolving line of credit. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes outside the normal course of business to the contractual obligations identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a description of our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the acquisition of investment properties, impairment of long-lived assets and unconsolidated joint ventures, cost capitalization, depreciation and amortization, development and redevelopment, investment properties held for sale, partially-owned entities, derivative and hedging, revenue recognition, accounts and notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts and income taxes.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our long-term debt that is used to maintain liquidity and fund our operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates, and in some cases variable rates with the ability to convert to fixed rates. 
  With regard to variable rate financing, we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both our outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as our potential offsetting hedge positions. The risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $250,000 of variable rate debt based on LIBOR that has been swapped to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps. Our interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016   are summarized in the following table: 

For a discussion concerning the scheduled debt maturities and principal amortization of our indebtedness as of   September 30, 2016   for the remainder of   2016  , each of the next four years and thereafter and the weighted average interest rates by year to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes, refer to Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and  Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Debt Maturities.  
  A decrease of 1% in market interest rates would result in a hypothetical decrease in our derivative asset of approximately $2,187. 
  The combined carrying amount of our mortgages payable, unsecured notes payable and Unsecured Credit Facility is approximately $119,075 lower than the fair value as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  We had   $200,000   of variable rate debt, excluding $250,000 of variable rate debt that has been swapped to fixed rate debt, with interest rates varying based upon LIBOR, with a weighted average interest rate of   1.97%   as of   September 30, 2016  . An increase in the variable interest rate on this debt constitutes a market risk. If interest rates increase by 1% based on debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , interest expense would increase by approximately $2,000 on an annualized basis. 
  We may use additional derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates. To the extent we do, we are exposed to market and credit risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, we generally are not exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty. We minimize credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties or with the same party providing the financing, with the right of offset.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to the members of senior management and the board of directors. 
  Based on management s evaluation as of   September 30, 2016  , our president and chief executive officer and our executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief executive officer and our executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  There were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

  ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
  On October 31, 2016, following an ordinary course review of our existing executive compensation arrangements and in connection with the upcoming expiration of the current terms of our existing retention agreements, we entered into retention agreements with each of Steven P. Grimes, Shane C. Garrison, Heath R. Fear and Paula C. Maggio. The retention agreements for Messrs. Grimes and Garrison replaced their prior retention agreements with us. 
  The term of each retention agreement is for three years beginning on October 31, 2016, with automatic two-year renewals thereafter unless written notice of termination is provided by either party. The term will also be automatically extended if a change in control, as defined in the agreement, occurs before the end of the then current term. 
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

Provided the executive enters into a general release of claims for our benefit, the retention agreements provide for the following payments and benefits in connection with the termination of each executive s employment by us without cause or termination by him or her for good reason: (1) cash payment equal to an agreed upon multiple (as described below) times the sum of (i) such executive s annual base salary and (ii) an amount equal to the greater of (A) the dollar amount of such executive s target annual cash bonus opportunity, or (B) the actual annual cash bonus earned for the most recent completed year for which an annual cash bonus had been determined; (2) cash payment of (i) any unpaid annual cash bonus earned for the prior year and (ii) a pro-rata annual cash bonus for the year in which the termination occurs; (3) acceleration of vesting of unvested equity awards that are only subject to time-based vesting conditions; (4) retention of outstanding equity awards granted on or after the date the retention agreements were entered into that remain subject to performance-based vesting conditions, with the earning of such awards to be based on achievement of the original performance-based vesting conditions in the same manner as if such termination had not occurred; provided that the portion of each such equity awards that is earned will be prorated based on the portion of the performance period that elapsed through the date of termination unless such termination occurred in connection with a change in control; and (5) healthcare continuation premiums for specified periods. The multiples to be used to determine the cash payment described above are two times for Mr. Grimes and one and a half times for Messrs. Garrison and Fear and Ms. Maggio if the termination does not occur in connection with or within two years after a change in control. If the termination occurs in connection with or within two years after a change in control, the multiples will be three times for Mr. Grimes and two times for Messrs. Garrison and Fear and Ms. Maggio. 
  Each retention agreement also provides that upon a change in control, the achievement of the performance-based vesting conditions of any outstanding equity awards granted on or after the date the retention agreements were entered into that remain subject to such vesting conditions will be measured based on performance through the day prior to the date of the change in control using performance metrics that have been prorated, to the extent applicable, to reflect the shortened performance period. Vesting conditions for these awards that are based on continued employment will continue to apply unless accelerated due to a termination of employment or otherwise. Furthermore, each retention agreement also provides that upon a termination as a result of death or disability, the executive s outstanding unvested equity awards will generally be treated in the same manner as they would in the event of a termination by us without cause or termination by such executive for good reason. 
  The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of the retention agreements, which are filed with this report as Exhibits 10.3 through 10.6 and are incorporated herein by reference.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
    
  THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT is made and entered into this 25   th    day of October, 2016 ("Agreement"), by and between RETAIL PROPERTIES OF AMERICA, INC., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and ROBERT G. GIFFORD     ("Indemnitee"). 
    
  WHEREAS, at the request of the Company, Indemnitee currently serves as a director     of the Company and may, therefore, be subjected to claims, suits or proceedings arising as a result of his service; and 
    
  WHEREAS, as an inducement to Indemnitee to continue to serve as such director,     the Company has agreed to indemnify and to advance expenses and costs incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any such claims, suits or proceedings, to the maximum extent permitted by law; and 
    
  WHEREAS, the parties by this Agreement desire to set forth their agreement regarding indemnification and advance of expenses; 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: 
    
  Section I.      Definitions.    For purposes of this Agreement: 
    
  (a)        "Change in Control" means a change in control of the Company occurring after the Effective Date of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or in response to any similar item on any similar schedule or form) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided, however, that, without limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if after the Effective Date (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 15%     or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities without the prior approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such person attaining such percentage interest; (ii) there occurs a proxy contest, or the Company is a party to a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, plan of liquidation or other reorganization not approved by at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors then in office, as a consequence of which members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the Board of Directors thereafter; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years, other than as a result of an event described in clause (a)(ii) of this Section 1, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors (including for this purpose any new director whose election or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of such period) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors. 
  
   1 

(b)  "Corporate Status" means the status of a person who is or was a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company. 
    
  (c)  "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee. 
    
  (d)  "Effective Date" means the date set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement. 
    
  (e)  "Expenses" shall include all reasonable and out-of-pocket attorneys' fees, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, or being or preparing to be a witness in a Proceeding. 
    
  (f)  "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party, or (ii) any other party to or witness in the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement. If a Change of Control has not occurred, Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors, with the approval of Indemnitee, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. If a Change of Control has occurred, Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. 
    
  (g)  "Proceeding" includes any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including on appeal), except one pending or completed on or before the Effective Date, unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the Company and Indemnitee. 
    
  Section 2.      Services by Indemnitee.    Indemnitee will serve as an officer     of the Company. However, this Agreement shall not impose any obligation on Indemnitee or the Company to continue Indemnitee's service to the Company beyond any period otherwise required by law or by other agreements or commitments of the parties, if any. 
    
  Section 3.      Indemnification - General.    The Company shall indemnify, and advance Expenses to, Indemnitee (a) as provided in this Agreement and (b) otherwise to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect on the date hereof and as amended from time to time; provided, however, that no change in Maryland law shall have the effect of reducing the benefits available to Indemnitee hereunder based on Maryland law as in effect on the date hereof. The rights of Indemnitee  
  
   2 

provided in this Section 3 shall include, without limitation, the rights set forth in the other sections of this Agreement, including any additional indemnification permitted by Section 2-418(g) of the Maryland General Corporation Law ("MGCL"). 
    
  Section 4.      Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company.    Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section 4 if, by reason of his/her Corporate Status, he/she is, or is threatened to be, made a party to or a witness in any threatened, pending, or completed Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her or on his/her behalf in connection with a Proceeding by reason of his/her Corporate Status unless it is established that (i) the act or omission of Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the Proceeding and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (ii) Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services, or (iii) in the case of any criminal Proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct was unlawful. 
    
  Section 5.      Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company.    Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section 5 if, by reason of his/her Corporate Status, he/she is, or is threatened to be, made a party to or a witness in any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 5, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all amounts paid in settlement and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her or on his/her behalf in connection with such Proceeding unless it is established that (i) the act or omission of Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to such a Proceeding and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty or (ii) Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services. 
    
  Section 6.      Court-Ordered Indemnification.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a court of appropriate jurisdiction, upon application of Indemnitee and such notice as the court shall require, may order indemnification in the following circumstances: 
    
  (a)  if it determines Indemnitee is entitled to reimbursement under Section 2-418(d)(1) of the MGCL, the court shall order indemnification, in which case Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the expenses of securing such reimbursement; or 
    
  (b)  if it determines that Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not Indemnitee (i) has met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 2-418(b) of the MGCL or (ii) has been adjudged liable for receipt of an improper personal benefit under Section 2-418(c) of the MGCL, the court may order such indemnification as the court shall deem proper. However, indemnification with respect to any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company or in which liability shall have been adjudged in the circumstances described in Section 2-418(c) of the MGCL shall be limited to Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her or on his/her behalf in connection with a Proceeding. 

3 

Section 7.      Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly     Successful.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and without limiting any such provision, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his/her Corporate Status, made a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any Proceeding, he/she shall be indemnified for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her or on his/her behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee under this Section 7 for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her or on his/her behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter, allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. 
    
  Section 8.      Advance of Expenses.    The Company shall advance all reasonable Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding brought to enforce indemnification under this Agreement, applicable law, the Charter or Bylaws of the Company, any agreement or a resolution of the stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the Board of Directors) to which Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party or a witness, within ten days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written affirmation by Indemnitee of Indemnitee's good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Company as authorized by law and by this Agreement has been met and a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee, in substantially the form attached hereto as   Exhibit     A or in such form as may be required under applicable law as in effect at the time of the execution thereof, to reimburse the portion of any Expenses advanced to Indemnitee relating to claims, issues or matters in the Proceeding as to which it shall ultimately be established that the standard of conduct has not been met and which have not been successfully resolved as described in Section 7. To the extent that Expenses advanced to Indemnitee do not relate to a specific claim, issue or matter in the Proceeding, such Expenses shall be allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis. The undertaking required by this Section 8 shall be an unlimited general obligation by or on behalf of Indemnitee and shall be accepted without reference to Indemnitee's financial ability to repay such advanced Expenses and without any requirement to post security therefor. 
    
  Section 9.      Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification. 
    
  (a)  To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. 

4 

(b)  Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of Section 9(a) hereof, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall promptly be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change of Control shall not have occurred, (A) by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as herein defined), or (B) if a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, or (C) if so directed by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, by the stockholders of the Company. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination in the discretion of the Board of Directors or Independent Counsel if retained pursuant to clause (ii)(B) of this Section 9. Any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company shall indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. 
    
  Section 10.      Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings. 
    
  (a)  In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 9(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making of any determination contrary to that presumption. 
    
  (b)  The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, a plea of   nolo     contendere   or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct described herein for indemnification. 

5 

Section 11.      Remedies of Indemnitee. 
    
  (a)    If (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advance of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 9(b) of this Agreement within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement within ten days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification is not made within ten days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court located in the State of Maryland, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of his/her entitlement to such indemnification or advance of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his/her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 11(a); provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply to a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his/her rights under Section 7 of this Agreement. 
    
  (b)    In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11 the Company shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advance of Expenses, as the case may be. 
    
  (c)    If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 9(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11, absent a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification. 
    
  (d)    In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 11, seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his/her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company for, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advance of Expenses sought, the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated. 
    
  Section 12.      Defense of the Underlying Proceeding. 
    
  (a)  Indemnitee shall notify the Company promptly upon being served with or receiving any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information, notice, request or other document relating to any Proceeding which may result in the right to indemnification or the advance  
  
   6 

of Expenses hereunder; provided, however, that the failure to give any such notice shall not disqualify Indemnitee from the right, or otherwise affect in any manner any right of Indemnitee, to indemnification or the advance of Expenses under this Agreement unless the Company's ability to defend in such Proceeding or to obtain proceeds under any insurance policy is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent the Company is thereby actually so prejudiced. 
    
  (b)  Subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 12(b) and of Section 12(c) below, the Company shall have the right to defend Indemnitee in any Proceeding which may give rise to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the   Company   shall notify Indemnitee of any such decision to defend within 15 calendar days following receipt of notice of any such Proceeding under Section 12(a) above. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, consent to the entry of any judgment against Indemnitee or enter into any settlement or compromise which (i) includes an admission of fault of Indemnitee or (ii) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the full release of Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Proceeding, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee. This Section 12(b) shall not apply to a Proceeding brought by Indemnitee under Section 11 above or Section 18 below. 
    
  (c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, if in a Proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, (i) Indemnitee reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that he/she may have separate defenses or counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be consistent with other defendants in such Proceeding, (ii) Indemnitee reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that an actual or apparent conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between Indemnitee and the Company, or (iii) if the Company fails to assume the defense of such Proceeding in a timely manner, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be represented by separate legal counsel of Indemnitee's choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, at the expense of the Company. In addition, if the Company fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any Proceeding to deny or to recover from Indemnitee the benefits intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall have the right to retain counsel of Indemnitee's choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, at the expense of the Company (subject to Section 11(d)), to represent Indemnitee in connection with any such matter. 
    
  Section 13.      Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Subrogation; Insurance. 
    
  (a)  The rights of indemnification and advance of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Charter or Bylaws of the Company, any agreement or a resolution of the stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the Board of Directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision  
  
   7 

hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his/her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. 
    
  (b)  In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
    
  (c)  The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable or payable or reimbursable as Expenses hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. 
    
  Section 14.      Insurance.   The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to acquire directors and officers liability insurance, on terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, with the advice of counsel, covering Indemnitee or any claim made against Indemnitee for service as a director or officer of the Company and covering the Company for any indemnification or advance of Expenses made by the Company to Indemnitee for any claims made against Indemnitee for service as a director or officer of the Company. Without in any way limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee for any payment by Indemnitee arising out of the amount of any deductible or retention and the amount of any excess of the aggregate of all judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding over the coverage of any insurance referred to in the previous sentence. 
    
  Section 15.      Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is or may be, by reason of his/her Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding, whether instituted by the Company or any other party, and to which Indemnitee is not a party but in which the Indemnitee receives a subpoena to testify, he/she shall be advanced all reasonable Expenses and indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her or on his/her behalf in connection therewith. 
    
  Section 16.      Duration of Agreement; Binding Effect. 
    
  (a)  This Agreement shall continue until and terminate ten years after the date that Indemnitee's Corporate Status shall have ceased; provided, that the rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall continue until the final termination of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advance of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement relating thereto. 
    
  (b)  The indemnification and advance of Expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), shall continue as  
  
   8 

to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise which such person is or was serving at the written request of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his/her spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other legal representatives. 
    
  (c)  The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. 
    
  Section 17.      Severability.   If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby. 
    
  Section 18.      Exception to Right of Indemnification or Advance of Expenses.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advance of Expenses under this Agreement with respect to any Proceeding brought by Indemnitee, unless (a) the Proceeding is brought to enforce indemnification under this Agreement, and then only to the extent in accordance with and as authorized by Sections 8 and 11 of this Agreement, or (b) the Company's Bylaws, as amended, the Charter, a resolution of the stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the Board of Directors or an agreement approved by the Board of Directors to which the Company is a party expressly provide otherwise. 
    
  Section 19.      Identical Counterparts.   This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. One such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought shall be sufficient to evidence the existence of this Agreement. 
    
  Section 20.      Headings.   The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.

EXHIBIT A 
    
  FORM OF UNDERTAKING TO REPAY EXPENSES ADVANCED 
  The Board of Directors of Retail Properties of America, Inc. 
    
  Re: Undertaking to Repay Expenses Advanced 
    
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
    
  This undertaking is being provided pursuant to that certain Indemnification Agreement dated the ____ day of     ___________________, 20___, by and between Retail Properties of America, Inc.     (the "Company") and the undersigned Indemnitee (the "Indemnification Agreement"), pursuant to which I am entitled to advance of expenses in connection with   [description of proceeding]   (the "Proceeding"). 
    
  Terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings specified in the Indemnification Agreement. 
    
  I am subject to the Proceeding by reason of my Corporate Status or by reason of alleged actions or omissions by me in such capacity. I hereby affirm that at all times, insofar as I was involved as a   [director or officer]   of the Company, in any of the facts or events giving rise to the Proceeding, I (1) acted in good faith and honestly, (2) did not receive any improper personal benefit in money, property or services and (3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that any act or omission by me was unlawful. 
    
  In consideration of the advance of Expenses by the Company for reasonable attorneys' fees and related expenses incurred by me in connection with the Proceeding (the "Advanced Expenses"), I hereby agree that if, in connection with the Proceeding, it is established that (1) an act or omission by me was material to the matter giving rise to the Proceeding and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty or (2) I actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, I had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful, then I shall promptly reimburse the portion of the Advanced Expenses relating to the claims, issues or matters in the Proceeding as to which the foregoing findings have been established and which have not been successfully resolved as described in Section 7 of the Indemnification Agreement. To the extent that Advanced Expenses do not relate to a specific claim, issue or matter in the Proceeding, I agree that such Expenses shall be allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis. 
    
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have executed this Affirmation and Undertaking on this day of __________________, _______ .

 EXHIBIT 10.3

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.3 

RETAIL PROPERTIES OF AMERICA, INC. 
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 
  RETENTION AGREEMENT 
  This Amended and Restated Retention Agreement (the    Agreement   ) is made and entered into by and between Steven P. Grimes (   Executive   ) and Retail Properties of America, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the    Company   ), effective as of October 31, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ). 
  R E C I T A L S 
  A.  On February 19, 2013, Executive and the Company entered into that certain Retention Agreement (the  Retention Agreement ). 
  B.  On February 19, 2015, Executive and the Company entered into that certain Amendment to the Retention Agreement (the  Amended Retention Agreement ). 
  C.  Although the Company anticipates the continuation of a mutually rewarding employment relationship with Executive, the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the    Board   ) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to amend and restate the Amended Retention Agreement to provide Executive with certain assurances in the event of the occurrence of an involuntary termination of Executive s employment with the Company.  Further, it is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change in control.  The Committee recognizes that such consideration as well as the possibility of an involuntary termination or reduction in responsibility can be a distraction to Executive and can cause Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities.  Accordingly, the Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of such an event. 
  D.  Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 8 below. 
  NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.  Term of Agreement  .  This Agreement shall have a term commencing on the Effective Date and continuing for three (3) years following the Effective Date (the    Term   ).  The Term shall be automatically extended for successive two (2) year periods unless the Committee has delivered notice to Executive no later than ninety (90) days prior to the completion of the then effective Term that this Agreement is not be extended; provided, however, that if, during the then effective Term, a Change in Control has occurred or the Company has entered into a definitive agreement that, upon consummation, would result in a Change in Control, then the Term shall automatically be extended until the second anniversary of the effective date of such Change in Control or, in the event such a definitive agreement is 

terminated without the Change in Control being consummated, the second anniversary of the date on which the Company entered into such definitive agreement. 
  2.  Termination Upon Disability or Death  .  The Company may terminate Executive s employment immediately at any time following Executive s Disability.  Executive s employment shall terminate automatically upon Executive s death.  In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Executive shall be entitled to receive only the following payments and benefits: (i) unpaid base salary at the rate then in effect, prorated to the date of Executive s termination of employment (the    Termination Date   ), together with any amounts to which Executive is then entitled pursuant to any employee benefit or business expense reimbursement plan or arrangement in which Executive is then a participant, (ii) acceleration in full upon the Termination Date of the vesting of all then unvested equity awards granted to Executive pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based solely on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Time-Based Equity Awards   ) and (iii) treatment of unvested equity awards, if any, granted to Executive on or after the date hereof pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based on the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Performance-Based Equity Awards   ) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2. In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Performance-Based Equity Awards will be treated as follows: (i) if the Termination Date occurs prior to the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then all of the vesting conditions applicable to such Performance-Based Equity Award that are based on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates will be deemed to have been satisfied and the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that will be earned and vest based the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (the    Performance-Based Conditions    of such Performance-Based Equity Award) will equal the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that would have been earned or vested based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions if Executive s employment had not been terminated, determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement (and Section 5 below, if applicable), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in which Executive was employed by the Company during such performance period and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in such performance period; and (b) if the Termination Date occurs after the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is or was earned based on the achievement of the Performance-Based Conditions of such Performance-Based Equity Award, but would not otherwise vest, will vest upon the later of the Termination Date or the date on which the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is earned based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions is determined.  The foregoing provisions, as they relate to the acceleration of vesting, are hereby deemed to be a part of each agreement evidencing each applicable Time-Based Equity Award and Performance-Based Equity Award to which Executive is a party and to supersede any contrary provision in any such agreement unless  
  
   - 2 - 

such agreement specifically refers to and disclaims this provision.  Any other unvested equity awards granted pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are not specifically described herein (i.e., unvested equity awards, if any, granted to Executive prior the date hereof pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based on the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates) will not be subject to acceleration pursuant to this Section, but will be governed by their terms.  All other Company obligations to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be automatically terminated and completely extinguished.  Executive shall not be entitled to receive the Severance Benefits described in Section 3 below. 
  3.  Involuntary Termination  .  The Company may terminate Executive s employment with the Company without Cause at any time.  Executive may terminate Executive s employment with the Company by reason of a Resignation for Good Reason.  In the event of any such Involuntary Termination: (i) Executive shall be entitled to receive unpaid base salary at the rate then in effect, prorated to the Termination Date, together with any amounts to which Executive is then entitled pursuant to any employee benefit or business expense reimbursement plan or arrangement in which Executive is then a participant, and (ii) in addition, provided that Executive executes and delivers to the Company in connection with such termination of employment a release of claims substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit     A  , amended as necessary to comply with applicable law (the    Release   ) and the period for revocation, if any, of the Release has lapsed on or before the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date without the Release having been revoked, the Company shall provide Executive with the following (the    Severance Benefits   ), and all other Company obligations to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be automatically terminated and completely extinguished: 
  (a)  Cash Severance (Non-Change in Control)  .  Executive shall receive on the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date a lump sum cash amount (less applicable withholdings) equal to (i) two (2) times the sum of (x) Executive s annual base salary at the rate then in effect (without giving effect to any reduction in the base salary rate amounting to Good Reason), (y) an amount equal to the greater of (1) Executive s target annual cash bonus opportunity for the year in which Executive s employment was terminated (or the prior year if a target annual cash bonus amount hadn t yet been established for such year), (the    Target Bonus   ) or (2) Executive s actual annual cash bonus earned for the most recent completed year for which an annual cash bonus had been determined preceding the year in which Executive s employment was terminated, plus (ii) to the extent not paid prior to the date of Executive s termination of employment, Executive s annual cash bonus for the year prior to the year in which Executive s employment was terminated, determined based upon the Company s and Executive s actual performance, paid as and when such annual cash bonuses are paid to similarly situated active employees of the Company, plus (iii) an amount equal to the Target Bonus multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the year up to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365. 
  (b)  Cash Severance (Change in Control)  .  In the event that Executive s Involuntary Termination occurs in connection with a Change in Control or during a Change in  
  
   - 3 - 

Control Period, then, in lieu of the amounts set forth above under Section 3(a), Executive shall receive on the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date a lump sum cash amount (less applicable withholdings) equal to (i) three (3) times the sum of (x) Executive s annual base salary at the rate then in effect (without giving effect to any reduction in the base salary rate amounting to Good Reason), (y) an amount equal to the greater of (1) Executive s Target Bonus or (2) Executive s actual annual cash bonus earned for the most recent completed year for which an annual cash bonus had been determined preceding the year in which Executive s employment was terminated, plus (ii) to the extent not paid prior to the date of Executive s termination of employment, Executive s annual cash bonus for the year prior to the year in which Executive s employment was terminated, determined based upon the Company s and Executive s actual performance, paid as and when such annual cash bonuses are paid to similarly situated active employees of the Company, plus (iii) an amount equal to the Target Bonus multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the year up to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365.

  (d)  The Company intends that income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement will not be subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code.  However, the Company does not guarantee any particular tax effect for income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.  In any event, except for the Company s responsibility to withhold applicable income and employment taxes from compensation paid or provided to Executive, the Company shall not be responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes on compensation paid or provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.

Exhibit 10.4 

RETAIL PROPERTIES OF AMERICA, INC. 
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 
  RETENTION AGREEMENT 
  This Amended and Restated Retention Agreement (the    Agreement   ) is made and entered into by and between Shane C. Garrison (   Executive   ) and Retail Properties of America, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the    Company   ), effective as of October 31, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ). 
  R E C I T A L S 
  A.  On February 19, 2013, Executive and the Company entered into that certain Retention Agreement (the  Retention Agreement ). 
  B.  On February 19, 2015, Executive and the Company entered into that certain Amendment to the Retention Agreement (the  Amended Retention Agreement ). 
  C.  Although the Company anticipates the continuation of a mutually rewarding employment relationship with Executive, the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the    Board   ) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to amend and restate the Amended Retention Agreement to provide Executive with certain assurances in the event of the occurrence of an involuntary termination of Executive s employment with the Company.  Further, it is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change in control.  The Committee recognizes that such consideration as well as the possibility of an involuntary termination or reduction in responsibility can be a distraction to Executive and can cause Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities.  Accordingly, the Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of such an event. 
  D.  Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 8 below. 
  NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.  Term of Agreement  .  This Agreement shall have a term commencing on the Effective Date and continuing for three (3) years following the Effective Date (the    Term   ).  The Term shall be automatically extended for successive two (2) year periods unless the Committee has delivered notice to Executive no later than ninety (90) days prior to the completion of the then effective Term that this Agreement is not be extended; provided, however, that if, during the then effective Term, a Change in Control has occurred or the Company has entered into a definitive agreement that, upon consummation, would result in a Change in Control, then the Term shall automatically be extended until the second anniversary of the effective date of such Change in Control or, in the event such a definitive agreement is  

terminated without the Change in Control being consummated, the second anniversary of the date on which the Company entered into such definitive agreement. 
  2.  Termination Upon Disability or Death  .  The Company may terminate Executive s employment immediately at any time following Executive s Disability.  Executive s employment shall terminate automatically upon Executive s death.  In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Executive shall be entitled to receive only the following payments and benefits: (i) unpaid base salary at the rate then in effect, prorated to the date of Executive s termination of employment (the    Termination Date   ), together with any amounts to which Executive is then entitled pursuant to any employee benefit or business expense reimbursement plan or arrangement in which Executive is then a participant, (ii) acceleration in full upon the Termination Date of the vesting of all then unvested equity awards granted to Executive pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based solely on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Time-Based Equity Awards   ) and (iii) treatment of unvested equity awards, if any, granted to Executive on or after the date hereof pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based on the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Performance-Based Equity Awards   ) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2. In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Performance-Based Equity Awards will be treated as follows: (i) if the Termination Date occurs prior to the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then all of the vesting conditions applicable to such Performance-Based Equity Award that are based on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates will be deemed to have been satisfied and the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that will be earned and vest based the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (the    Performance-Based Conditions    of such Performance-Based Equity Award) will equal the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that would have been earned or vested based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions if Executive s employment had not been terminated, determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement (and Section 5 below, if applicable), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in which Executive was employed by the Company during such performance period and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in such performance period; and (b) if the Termination Date occurs after the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is or was earned based on the achievement of the Performance-Based Conditions of such Performance-Based Equity Award, but would not otherwise vest, will vest upon the later of the Termination Date or the date on which the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is earned based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions is determined.

The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each agreement evidencing each applicable Performance-Based Equity Award to which Executive is a party and to supersede any contrary provision in any such agreement unless such agreement specifically refers to and disclaims this provision. 
  6.  Recoupment  .  Bonus, incentive and equity compensation paid or provided to Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such policy of recoupment of compensation as shall be adopted from time to time by the Board or the Committee as it deems necessary or desirable to comply with the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (providing for recovery of erroneously awarded compensation), Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (providing for forfeiture of certain bonuses and profits), and any implementing rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable listing standards of a national securities exchange adopted in accordance with any such Act (the    Recoupment Policy   ).

   - 6 - 

Code (   Excise Tax   ), then Executive s severance payments and benefits under this Agreement, the Employment Agreement or otherwise shall be payable either 
  (a)  in full, or 
  (b)  in such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance payments or benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance payments and benefits under this Agreement, the Employment Agreement or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments or benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.  Any reduction in the severance payments and benefits required by this Section will made in the following order: (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) reduction of accelerated vesting of equity awards other than stock options; (iii) reduction of accelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of other benefits paid or provided to Executive.  In the event that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting will be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of Executive s equity awards.  If two or more equity awards are granted on the same date, each award will be reduced on a pro-rata basis. 
  The professional firm engaged by the Company for general tax purposes as of the day prior to the date of the event that might reasonably be anticipated to result in severance payments and benefits that would otherwise be subject to the Excise Tax will perform the foregoing calculations.  If the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the acquiring company, the Company will appoint a nationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section.  The Company will bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such firm required to be made by this Section.  The Company and Executive shall furnish such tax firm such information and documents as the tax firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination.  The tax firm will provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and Executive as soon as practicable following its engagement.  Any good faith determinations of the tax firm made hereunder will be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and Executive.

By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both Executive and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding.  The arbitrator shall:  (i) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (ii) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award.  The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that Executive or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law.  Each party shall bear its own respective attorney fees and all other costs, unless provided by law and awarded by the arbitrator; provided, however, that the Company shall pay all AAA arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required if the dispute were decided in a court of law.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either Executive or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive and the Company each have the right to resolve any issue or dispute over intellectual property rights by Court action instead of arbitration. 
  (b)  Executive understands that this Agreement does not prohibit Executive from pursuing an administrative claim with a local, state or federal administrative body such as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the workers  compensation Committee.  This Agreement, does, however, preclude Executive from pursuing court action regarding any such claim. 
  (c)  Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive is executing this Agreement voluntarily and without any duress or undue influence by the Company or anyone else.  Executive further acknowledges and agrees that Executive has carefully read this Agreement and that Executive has asked any questions needed for Executive to understand the terms, consequences and binding effect of this Agreement and fully understands it, including that Executive is waiving Executive s right to a jury trial.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with such intentions.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary: 
  (a)  No amount payable pursuant to this Agreement which constitutes a  deferral of compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A shall be paid unless and until Executive has incurred a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A.  Furthermore, to the extent that Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A (determined using the identification methodology selected by the Company from time to time, or if none, the default methodology) as of the date of Executive s separation from service, no amount that constitutes a deferral of compensation which is payable on account of Executive s separation from service shall paid to Executive before the date (the    Delayed Payment Date   ) which is first day of the seventh month after the date of Executive s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of Executive s death following such separation from service.  All such amounts that would, but for this Section, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date. 
  (b)  Each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment and the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 
  (c)  With regard to any provision in this Agreement that provides for reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits, except for any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement that does not constitute a  deferral of compensation,  within the meaning of Section 409A, (i) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year, provided that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not be deemed to be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Section 105(b) of the Code solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect, and (iii) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense occurred. 
  (d)  The Company intends that income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement will not be subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code.  However, the Company does not guarantee any particular tax effect for income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.  In any event, except for the Company s responsibility to withhold applicable income and employment taxes from compensation paid or provided to Executive, the Company shall not be responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes on compensation paid or provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.

Exhibit 10.5 

RETAIL PROPERTIES OF AMERICA, INC. 
  RETENTION AGREEMENT 
  This Retention Agreement (the    Agreement   ) is made and entered into by and between Heath R. Fear (   Executive   ) and Retail Properties of America, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the    Company   ), effective as of October 31, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ). 
  R E C I T A L S 
  A.  Although the Company anticipates the continuation of a mutually rewarding employment relationship with Executive, the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the    Board   ) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide Executive with certain assurances in the event of the occurrence of an involuntary termination of Executive s employment with the Company.  Further, it is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change in control.  The Committee recognizes that such consideration as well as the possibility of an involuntary termination or reduction in responsibility can be a distraction to Executive and can cause Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities.  Accordingly, the Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of such an event. 
  B.  Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 8 below. 
  NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.  Term of Agreement  .  This Agreement shall have a term commencing on the Effective Date and continuing for three (3) years following the Effective Date (the    Term   ).  The Term shall be automatically extended for successive two (2) year periods unless the Committee has delivered notice to Executive no later than ninety (90) days prior to the completion of the then effective Term that this Agreement is not be extended; provided, however, that if, during the then effective Term, a Change in Control has occurred or the Company has entered into a definitive agreement that, upon consummation, would result in a Change in Control, then the Term shall automatically be extended until the second anniversary of the effective date of such Change in Control or, in the event such a definitive agreement is terminated without the Change in Control being consummated, the second anniversary of the date on which the Company entered into such definitive agreement. 
  2.  Termination Upon Disability or Death  .  The Company may terminate Executive s employment immediately at any time following Executive s Disability.  Executive s employment shall terminate automatically upon Executive s death.  In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Executive shall be entitled to receive only the following payments and benefits: (i) unpaid base salary at the rate then in effect, prorated to the date of Executive s termination of employment (the    Termination Date   ), together with any  

amounts to which Executive is then entitled pursuant to any employee benefit or business expense reimbursement plan or arrangement in which Executive is then a participant, (ii) acceleration in full upon the Termination Date of the vesting of all then unvested equity awards granted to Executive pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based solely on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Time-Based Equity Awards   ) and (iii) treatment of unvested equity awards, if any, granted to Executive on or after the date hereof pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based on the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Performance-Based Equity Awards   ) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2. In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Performance-Based Equity Awards will be treated as follows: (i) if the Termination Date occurs prior to the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then all of the vesting conditions applicable to such Performance-Based Equity Award that are based on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates will be deemed to have been satisfied and the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that will be earned and vest based the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (the    Performance-Based Conditions    of such Performance-Based Equity Award) will equal the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that would have been earned or vested based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions if Executive s employment had not been terminated, determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement (and Section 5 below, if applicable), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in which Executive was employed by the Company during such performance period and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in such performance period; and (b) if the Termination Date occurs after the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is or was earned based on the achievement of the Performance-Based Conditions of such Performance-Based Equity Award, but would not otherwise vest, will vest upon the later of the Termination Date or the date on which the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is earned based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions is determined.  The foregoing provisions, as they relate to the acceleration of vesting, are hereby deemed to be a part of each agreement evidencing each applicable Time-Based Equity Award and Performance-Based Equity Award to which Executive is a party and to supersede any contrary provision in any such agreement unless such agreement specifically refers to and disclaims this provision.  Any other unvested equity awards granted pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are not specifically described herein (i.e., unvested equity awards, if any, granted to Executive prior the date hereof pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based on the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates) will not be subject to acceleration pursuant to this Section, but will be governed by their terms.  All other Company obligations to Executive

In the event of any such Involuntary Termination: (i) Executive shall be entitled to receive unpaid base salary at the rate then in effect, prorated to the Termination Date, together with any amounts to which Executive is then entitled pursuant to any employee benefit or business expense reimbursement plan or arrangement in which Executive is then a participant, and (ii) in addition, provided that Executive executes and delivers to the Company in connection with such termination of employment a release of claims substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit     A  , amended as necessary to comply with applicable law (the    Release   ) and the period for revocation, if any, of the Release has lapsed on or before the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date without the Release having been revoked, the Company shall provide Executive with the following (the    Severance Benefits   ), and all other Company obligations to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be automatically terminated and completely extinguished: 
  (a)  Cash Severance (Non-Change in Control)  .  Executive shall receive on the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date a lump sum cash amount (less applicable withholdings) equal to (i) one and a half (1.5) times the sum of (x) Executive s annual base salary at the rate then in effect (without giving effect to any reduction in the base salary rate amounting to Good Reason), (y) an amount equal to the greater of (1) Executive s target annual cash bonus opportunity for the year in which Executive s employment was terminated (or the prior year if a target annual cash bonus amount hadn t yet been established for such year), (the    Target Bonus   ) or (2) Executive s actual annual cash bonus earned for the most recent completed year for which an annual cash bonus had been determined preceding the year in which Executive s employment was terminated, plus (ii) to the extent not paid prior to the date of Executive s termination of employment, Executive s annual cash bonus for the year prior to the year in which Executive s employment was terminated, determined based upon the Company s and Executive s actual performance, paid as and when such annual cash bonuses are paid to similarly situated active employees of the Company, plus (iii) an amount equal to the Target Bonus multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the year up to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365. 
  (b)  Cash Severance (Change in Control)  .  In the event that Executive s Involuntary Termination occurs in connection with a Change in Control or during a Change in Control Period, then, in lieu of the amounts set forth above under Section 3(a), Executive shall receive on the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date a lump sum cash amount (less applicable withholdings) equal to (i) two (2) times the sum of (x) Executive s annual base salary at the rate then in effect (without giving effect to any reduction in the base salary rate amounting to Good Reason), (y) an amount equal to the greater of (1) Executive s Target Bonus or (2) Executive s actual annual cash bonus earned for the most recent completed year for which an annual cash bonus had been determined preceding the year in which Executive s employment was terminated, plus (ii) to the extent not paid prior to the date of Executive s termination of

  (i)  Time-Based Equity Awards  .  The vesting of all Time-Based Equity Awards shall accelerate in full upon the Termination Date. 
  (ii)  Performance-Based Equity (Non-Change in Control)  .  In the event that Executive s Involuntary Termination does not occur in connection with a Change in Control or during a Change in Control Period, Performance-Based Equity Awards will be treated as follows: (i) if the Termination Date occurs prior to the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then all of the vesting conditions applicable to such Performance-Based Equity Award that are based on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates will be deemed to have been satisfied and the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that will be earned and vest based the achievement of the Performance-Based Conditions of such Performance-Based Equity Award will equal the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that would have been earned or vested based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions if Executive s employment had not been terminated, determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement (and Section 5 below, if applicable), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in which Executive was employed by the Company during such performance period and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in such performance period; and (b) if the Termination Date occurs after the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is or was earned based on the achievement of the Performance-Based Conditions of such Performance-Based Equity Award, but would not otherwise vest, will vest upon the later of the Termination Date or the date on which the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is earned based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions is determined. 
  (iii)  Performance-Based Equity (Change in Control)  .  In the event that Executive s Involuntary Termination occurs in connection with a Change in Control or during a Change in Control Period, all of the vesting conditions applicable to the Performance-Based Equity Awards that are based on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates will be deemed to have been satisfied and the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Awards that will be earned and vest based the achievement of the Performance-Based Conditions of such Performance-Based Equity Awards will equal the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Awards that would have been earned or vested based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions if Executive s employment had not been terminated, determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement (and Section 5 below, if applicable), with such vesting occurring, for each Performance-Based Equity Award, upon the later of the

  (d)  Continued Healthcare  .  If Executive was participating in the Company s group health plan immediately prior to the Termination Date then the Company shall pay Executive a monthly cash payment for a period of up to: (x) eighteen (18) months after the Termination Date, in the event of Executive s Involuntary Termination other than in connection with a Change in Control; or (y) twenty four (24) months after the Termination Date, in the event that Executive s Involuntary Termination occurs in connection with a Change in Control or during a Change in Control Period, as applicable, equal to the total premiums for such group health plan coverage (based on Executive s coverage elections in effect as of the Termination Date) (the    Company Benefit Payment      provided  , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Executive be entitled to the Company Benefit Payment after the first date on which Executive becomes eligible for healthcare coverage under the plan of a subsequent employer of Executive.

The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each agreement evidencing each applicable Performance-Based Equity Award to which Executive is a party and to supersede any contrary provision in any such agreement unless such agreement specifically refers to and disclaims this provision.

  (a)  in full, or 
  (b)  in such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance payments or benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax,  
  
   -6- 

results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance payments and benefits under this Agreement, the Employment Agreement or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments or benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.  Any reduction in the severance payments and benefits required by this Section will made in the following order: (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) reduction of accelerated vesting of equity awards other than stock options; (iii) reduction of accelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of other benefits paid or provided to Executive.

  The professional firm engaged by the Company for general tax purposes as of the day prior to the date of the event that might reasonably be anticipated to result in severance payments and benefits that would otherwise be subject to the Excise Tax will perform the foregoing calculations.  If the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the acquiring company, the Company will appoint a nationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section.  The Company will bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such firm required to be made by this Section.  The Company and Executive shall furnish such tax firm such information and documents as the tax firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination.  The tax firm will provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and Executive as soon as practicable following its engagement.

   -11- 

dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (ii) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either Executive or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive and the Company each have the right to resolve any issue or dispute over intellectual property rights by Court action instead of arbitration. 
  (b)  Executive understands that this Agreement does not prohibit Executive from pursuing an administrative claim with a local, state or federal administrative body such as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the workers  compensation Committee.  This Agreement, does, however, preclude Executive from pursuing court action regarding any such claim. 
  (c)  Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive is executing this Agreement voluntarily and without any duress or undue influence by the Company or anyone else.  Executive further acknowledges and agrees that Executive has carefully read this Agreement and that Executive has asked any questions needed for Executive to understand the terms, consequences and binding effect of this Agreement and fully understands it, including that Executive is waiving Executive s right to a jury trial.

  (d)  The Company intends that income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement will not be subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code.

Exhibit 10.6 

RETAIL PROPERTIES OF AMERICA, INC. 
  RETENTION AGREEMENT 
  This Retention Agreement (the    Agreement   ) is made and entered into by and between Paula C. Maggio (   Executive   ) and Retail Properties of America, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the    Company   ), effective as of October 31, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ). 
  R E C I T A L S 
  A.  Although the Company anticipates the continuation of a mutually rewarding employment relationship with Executive, the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the    Board   ) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide Executive with certain assurances in the event of the occurrence of an involuntary termination of Executive s employment with the Company.  Further, it is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change in control.  The Committee recognizes that such consideration as well as the possibility of an involuntary termination or reduction in responsibility can be a distraction to Executive and can cause Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities.  Accordingly, the Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of such an event. 
  B.  Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 8 below. 
  NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.  Term of Agreement  .  This Agreement shall have a term commencing on the Effective Date and continuing for three (3) years following the Effective Date (the    Term   ).  The Term shall be automatically extended for successive two (2) year periods unless the Committee has delivered notice to Executive no later than ninety (90) days prior to the completion of the then effective Term that this Agreement is not be extended; provided, however, that if, during the then effective Term, a Change in Control has occurred or the Company has entered into a definitive agreement that, upon consummation, would result in a Change in Control, then the Term shall automatically be extended until the second anniversary of the effective date of such Change in Control or, in the event such a definitive agreement is terminated without the Change in Control being consummated, the second anniversary of the date on which the Company entered into such definitive agreement. 
  2.  Termination Upon Disability or Death  .  The Company may terminate Executive s employment immediately at any time following Executive s Disability.  Executive s employment shall terminate automatically upon Executive s death.  In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Executive shall be entitled to receive only the  

following payments and benefits: (i) unpaid base salary at the rate then in effect, prorated to the date of Executive s termination of employment (the    Termination Date   ), together with any amounts to which Executive is then entitled pursuant to any employee benefit or business expense reimbursement plan or arrangement in which Executive is then a participant, (ii) acceleration in full upon the Termination Date of the vesting of all then unvested equity awards granted to Executive pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based solely on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Time-Based Equity Awards   ) and (iii) treatment of unvested equity awards, if any, granted to Executive on or after the date hereof pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based on the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (   Performance-Based Equity Awards   ) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2. In the event that Executive s employment is terminated in accordance with this Section 2, Performance-Based Equity Awards will be treated as follows: (i) if the Termination Date occurs prior to the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then all of the vesting conditions applicable to such Performance-Based Equity Award that are based on Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates will be deemed to have been satisfied and the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that will be earned and vest based the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates (the    Performance-Based Conditions    of such Performance-Based Equity Award) will equal the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that would have been earned or vested based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions if Executive s employment had not been terminated, determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement (and Section 5 below, if applicable), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in which Executive was employed by the Company during such performance period and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in such performance period; and (b) if the Termination Date occurs after the end of the performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Equity Award, then the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is or was earned based on the achievement of the Performance-Based Conditions of such Performance-Based Equity Award, but would not otherwise vest, will vest upon the later of the Termination Date or the date on which the portion of such Performance-Based Equity Award that is earned based on the achievement of such Performance-Based Conditions is determined.  The foregoing provisions, as they relate to the acceleration of vesting, are hereby deemed to be a part of each agreement evidencing each applicable Time-Based Equity Award and Performance-Based Equity Award to which Executive is a party and to supersede any contrary provision in any such agreement unless such agreement specifically refers to and disclaims this provision.  Any other unvested equity awards granted pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are not specifically described herein (i.e., unvested equity awards, if any, granted to Executive prior the date hereof pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Executive that are subject to vesting conditions that are based on the achievement of corporate financial, stockholder return or other performance goals or any condition other than or in addition to Executive s continued employment or service through specified dates) will not be subject to acceleration pursuant to

The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each agreement evidencing each applicable Performance-Based Equity Award to which Executive is a party and to supersede any contrary provision in any such agreement unless such agreement specifically refers to and disclaims this provision.

  (a)  in full, or 
  (b)  in such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance payments or benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts,  

- 6 - 

taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance payments and benefits under this Agreement, the Employment Agreement or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments or benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.

  The professional firm engaged by the Company for general tax purposes as of the day prior to the date of the event that might reasonably be anticipated to result in severance payments and benefits that would otherwise be subject to the Excise Tax will perform the foregoing calculations.  If the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the acquiring company, the Company will appoint a nationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section.  The Company will bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such firm required to be made by this Section.  The Company and Executive shall furnish such tax firm such information and documents as the tax firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination.

- 10 - 

customers, employees, business methods, public relations methods, organization, procedures or finances, including, without limitation, information of or relating to customer lists, of the Company and its affiliates.  Executive understands that pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted or applied to prohibit Executive from making any good faith report to any governmental agency or other governmental entity concerning any acts or omissions that Executive may believe to constitute a possible violation of federal or state law or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable federal or state law or regulation. Further, this Agreement does not limit your ability to communicate with any government agency or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any government agency, including providing documents or other information, without notice to the Company nor does it limit any right you may have to receive an award for information provided to any government agencies. 
  (b)  Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement  .  Executive shall not for a period of one (1) year following Executive s termination of employment for any reason, either on Executive s own account or jointly with or as a manager, agent, officer, employee, consultant, partner, joint venturer, owner or shareholder or otherwise on behalf of any other person, firm or corporation, directly or indirectly solicit or attempt to solicit away from the Company any of its officers or employees or offer employment to any person who is an officer or employee of the Company;   provided, however  , that a general advertisement to which an employee of the Company responds shall in no event be deemed to result in a breach of this Section 11(b).  Executive also agrees not to harass or disparage the Company or its employees, clients, directors or agents. 
  (c)  Survival of Provisions  .  The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination or expiration of the Executive s employment with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.  If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in this Section 11 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state. 
  12.  Dispute Resolution  . 
  (a)  To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that arise in connection with this Agreement, Executive and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising from or relating to the enforcement, breach, performance or interpretation of this Agreement, Executive s employment, or the termination of Executive s employment, shall be resolved to the fullest extent permitted by law by final, binding and confidential arbitration, by a single neutral arbitrator, in DuPage County, Illinois, conducted by  

- 11 - 

the American Arbitration Association. (   AAA   ) under its rules for arbitration of employment disputes.  By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both Executive and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding.  The arbitrator shall:  (i) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (ii) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award.  The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that Executive or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law.  Each party shall bear its own respective attorney fees and all other costs, unless provided by law and awarded by the arbitrator; provided, however, that the Company shall pay all AAA arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required if the dispute were decided in a court of law.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either Executive or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive and the Company each have the right to resolve any issue or dispute over intellectual property rights by Court action instead of arbitration. 
  (b)  Executive understands that this Agreement does not prohibit Executive from pursuing an administrative claim with a local, state or federal administrative body such as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the workers  compensation Committee.  This Agreement, does, however, preclude Executive from pursuing court action regarding any such claim. 
  (c)  Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive is executing this Agreement voluntarily and without any duress or undue influence by the Company or anyone else.  Executive further acknowledges and agrees that Executive has carefully read this Agreement and that Executive has asked any questions needed for Executive to understand the terms, consequences and binding effect of this Agreement and fully understands it, including that Executive is waiving Executive s right to a jury trial.  Finally, Executive agrees that Executive has been provided an opportunity to seek the advice of an attorney of Executive s choice before signing this Agreement. 
  13.  Compliance with Section 409A of the Code  .  The parties intend that this Agreement (and all payments and other benefits provided under this Agreement) be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and ruling issued thereunder (collectively    Section 409A   ), to the maximum extent possible, whether pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the involuntary separation pay plan exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), or otherwise.  To the extent Section 409A is applicable to such payments, the parties intend that this Agreement (and such payments and benefits) comply with the deferral, payout and other limitations and restrictions imposed under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with such intentions.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary: 

- 12 - 

(a)  No amount payable pursuant to this Agreement which constitutes a  deferral of compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A shall be paid unless and until Executive has incurred a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A.  Furthermore, to the extent that Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A (determined using the identification methodology selected by the Company from time to time, or if none, the default methodology) as of the date of Executive s separation from service, no amount that constitutes a deferral of compensation which is payable on account of Executive s separation from service shall paid to Executive before the date (the    Delayed Payment Date   ) which is first day of the seventh month after the date of Executive s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of Executive s death following such separation from service.  All such amounts that would, but for this Section, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date. 
  (b)  Each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment and the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 
  (c)  With regard to any provision in this Agreement that provides for reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits, except for any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement that does not constitute a  deferral of compensation,  within the meaning of Section 409A, (i) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year, provided that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not be deemed to be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Section 105(b) of the Code solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect, and (iii) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense occurred. 
  (d)  The Company intends that income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement will not be subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code.  However, the Company does not guarantee any particular tax effect for income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.  In any event, except for the Company s responsibility to withhold applicable income and employment taxes from compensation paid or provided to Executive, the Company shall not be responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes on compensation paid or provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement. 
  14.  Miscellaneous Provisions. 
  (a)  At-Will Employment  .  Executive acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to imply that Executive s employment is guaranteed for any period of time.  Unless stated in a written agreement signed by an officer of the Company authorized by the Board or Committee and Executive, Executive s employment is at-will and either the Company or Executive may terminate the employment relationship at any time with or without cause and with or without notice. 

- 13 - 

(b)  Unfunded Obligation  .  Any amounts payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement are unfunded obligations.  The Company shall not be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations.  The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder.  Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Board or the Company and Executive, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in Executive or Executive s creditors in any assets of the Company. 
  (c)  No Duty to Mitigate  .  Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit contemplated by this Agreement by seeking employment with a new employer or otherwise, nor shall any such payment or benefit be reduced by any compensation or benefits that Executive may receive from employment by another employer other than as provided in Section 3(d). 
  (d)  Waiver  .  No provision of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than Executive).  No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time. 
  (e)  Whole Agreement  .  This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior arrangements and understandings regarding same. 
  (f)  Tax Withholding.    All payments made pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to withholding of applicable taxes.

  (h)  Severability  .  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect. 
  (i)  Benefits Not Assignable  .  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, no right or interest of Executive under this Agreement shall be assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including, without  

- 14 - 

limitation, by execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge or in any other manner, and no attempted transfer or assignment thereof shall be effective.  No right or interest of Executive under this Agreement shall be liable for, or subject to, any obligation or liability of Executive. 
  (j)  Further Assurances  .  From time to time, at the Company s request and without further consideration, Executive shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as reasonably requested by the Company to be necessary or desirable to make effective, in the most expeditious manner possible, the terms of this Agreement and the Release, and to provide adequate assurance of Executive s due performance thereunder. 
  (k)  Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

Exhibit 31.1  
  CERTIFICATION 
  Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
    
  I, Steven P. Grimes, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Retail Properties of America, Inc.;  
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and  
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
