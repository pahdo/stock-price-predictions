FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains
forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations
relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. These statements
may include words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   plan, 
 intend,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the
timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions
that we have made in light of our experience in the industry in which we operate, as well as our perceptions of historical trends,
current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although
we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could
affect our actual financial condition or results of operations, impact our strategic review and exploration process, including
the outcome of any decisions we may make regarding strategic alternatives, or cause our actual results to differ materially from
those in the forward-looking statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

During 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) has issued Accounting Standards Updates ( ASUs ) 2016-01 through
2016-15. Except for ASU 2016-02, 2016-08, 2016-09, 2016-10, 2016-12 and 2016-15, which are discussed below, these ASUs provide
technical corrections or simplification to existing guidance and to specialized industries or entities and therefore have minimal,
if any, impact on the Company. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. The
provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years,
with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this ASU and has not yet determined the impact of
the adoption on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-09 , Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
The objective of this ASU is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company adopted this ASU as of March 31, 2016 and that
adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This ASU requires that an entity recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also provides a more robust framework for revenue issues
and improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across industries. This ASU was the product of a joint project between
the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common
revenue standard. This guidance was to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.  This ASU confirmed a one-year delay in the effective date of ASU
2014-09, making the effective date for the Company the first quarter of fiscal 2018 instead of the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Consideration
(Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net) . This ASU is further guidance to ASU 2014-09, and clarifies principal versus agent considerations.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing.  This ASU is also further guidance to ASU 2014-09, and clarifies the identification of performance obligations.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients.  This ASU is also further guidance to ASU 2014-09, and clarifies assessing the narrow aspects of recognizing revenue.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASUs 2014-09, 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12 on its condensed
consolidated financial statements and has not yet 

determined the method by which the Company
will adopt ASU 2014-09. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-15 , Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments .
This ASU addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under
Topic 230,  Statement of Cash Flows , and other Topics. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods
therein, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The implementation of this ASU is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Refinancing   

On January 25, 2016,
the Company entered into a senior loan agreement (the  Senior Loan Agreement ), providing for a five year term loan
facility in the aggregate principal amount of $85.0 million and a five year $5.0 million revolving credit facility, and a subordinated
loan agreement (the  Subordinated Loan Agreement ), providing for a five and a half year term loan facility in the
aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million. On February 17, 2016, the Subordinated Loan Agreement was amended to increase the
aggregate principal amount available for borrowing thereunder to $15.3 million, and the Company borrowed $85.0 million under the
term loan facility of the Senior Loan Agreement and $15.3 million under the Subordinated Loan Agreement. The Company used the borrowings
under the Senior Loan Agreement and the Subordinated Loan Agreement to, among other things, pay all amounts due, including principal,
interest and fees, and satisfy in full all of its obligations under its previous credit facility (the  Previous Credit Facility ),
which was scheduled to mature on April 30, 2016. As a result of the repayment of the Previous Credit Facility, all of the shares
of the Company s Class B common stock were automatically converted into an equal number of shares of the Company s
Class A common stock. The term loan facility under the Senior Loan Agreement requires principal payments of $1.0 million quarterly,
beginning on April 1, 2016. Principal amounts outstanding under the Subordinated Loan Agreement will generally not be due until
maturity. The Company recorded costs of $15 thousand and write-off of loan costs of $140 thousand in connection with this refinancing. 

Reclassifications   

Certain items in the
prior year s condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to 2016 presentation. In addition,
the Company has corrected a typographical mistake in the Company s audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2015. Specifically, current liabilities as shown in its audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 included in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 was presented as $1,181 thousand but should have been $1,818
thousand, or an increase of $637 thousand. The typographical mistake did not affect the total current liabilities as of December
31, 2015, as set forth in the audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Based on its evaluation, the Company
concluded that it is not probable that the analysis of a reasonable person relying on the financial statements would have been
changed or influenced by the mistake or its correction. 

2.    Notes Payable    

Notes payable consists
of the following (in thousands, except percentages) as of: 

Associated with the
Senior Loan Agreement, the Company has capitalized and amortized deferred financing cost using the effective interest method. The
Company has capitalized $4.9 million in deferred financing cost associated with the Senior Loan Agreement. Amortization expense
for the deferred financing cost associated with the Senior Loan Agreement was $704 thousand for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

Associated with the
Subordinated Loan Agreement, the Company has capitalized and amortized deferred financing cost using the effective interest method.
The Company has capitalized $892 thousand in deferred financing cost associated with the Subordinated Loan Agreement. Amortization
expense for the deferred financing cost associated with the Subordinated Loan Agreement was $99 thousand for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

Associated with the
Previous Credit Facility, the Company had capitalized and amortized deferred financing cost using the effective interest method.
The Company had capitalized $2.7 million in deferred financing cost associated with the Previous Credit Facility. Amortization
expense for the deferred financing cost associated with the third amendment and restatement of the Previous Credit Facility was
$141 thousand and $665 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company wrote off $140
thousand of prior deferred financing cost and incurred $15 thousand in external legal fees during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as a result of the extinguishment of the Previous Credit Facility, which is included in interest expense. 

The Company had a revolving
credit facility on December 31, 2015 of $5.0 million associated with the Previous Credit Facility. There was no balance outstanding
as of December 31, 2015. The facility was terminated on February 17, 2016. The Company paid a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum,
payable quarterly in arrears, on the unused portion of the revolver loan under the Previous Credit Facility. The commitment fee
expense was $3 thousand and $19 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The revolving credit
facility associated with the Company s Senior Loan Agreement had a maximum borrowing capacity of $5.0 million on September
30, 2016. The revolving credit facility is available until February 17, 2021. There was no balance outstanding as of September
30, 2016. The Company pays a monthly fee of 0.75% per annum on the unused portion of the revolver loan under the Senior Loan Agreement,
payable in arrears. The fee expense was $24 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Maturities of notes
payable for the next five years and thereafter, assuming no annual excess cash flow payments and the PIK interest, are as follows
(in thousands): 

In addition, PIK interest
of $1,772 thousand associated with the Subordinated Loan Agreement will be paid at maturity. A total of $5,758 thousand of debt
issuance cost is amortized over the life of the loans and is recorded net of the notes payable on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. 

The Company s
notes payable agreements are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness, financial guarantees, business
combinations and other related items. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants and restrictions. 

3.    Income Tax    

As of each of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $0 and $25 thousand,
respectively. The Company had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The
Company establishes valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had no valuation allowance recorded. 

The effective income tax rate as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 39.1% and 39.8%, respectively. 

4.    Net Income per Common Share    

Basic net income per
common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that would occur should all of the shares of Class A common stock underlying
restricted stock units ( RSUs ), as well as all of the shares of Class A common stock, for which the Company has accrued
an expense, that may be delivered pursuant to the purchase agreement relating to the assets of Reliable Networks of Maine, LLC
( Reliable Networks ), be issued. 

A reconciliation of
the common shares for purposes of the calculation of the Company s basic and diluted net income per common share is as follows
(weighted average number of common shares outstanding in whole numbers and net income in thousands): 

5.    Revenue Concentrations    

Revenues for interstate
access services are based on reimbursement of costs and an allowed rate of return. Revenues of this nature are received from the
National Exchange Carrier Association in the form of monthly settlements. Such revenues amounted to 18.4% and 16.9% of the Company s
total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

6.    Commitments and Contingencies    

From time to time,
the Company may be involved in various claims, legal actions and regulatory proceedings incidental to and in the ordinary course
of business, including administrative hearings of the Alabama Public Service Commission, the Maine Public Utilities Commission,
the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Cable, the Missouri Public Service Commission, the New Hampshire Public
Utilities Commission, the Vermont Public Service Board and the West Virginia Public Service Commission, relating primarily to rate
making. In addition, the Company may be involved in similar proceedings with interconnection carriers and the Federal Communications
Commission (the  FCC ). Currently, except as set forth below, none of the Company s legal proceedings are expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 

Sprint Communications
L.P. ( Sprint ), MCI Communications Services, Inc. ( MCI ) and Verizon Select Services, Inc. ( Verizon )
filed more than 60 lawsuits in federal courts across the United States alleging that over 400 local exchange carriers ( LECs 
or  LEC Defendants ) overcharged Sprint, MCI and Verizon for so-called intraMTA traffic (wireless phone calls that
originate and terminate in the same metropolitan transit area). The lawsuits seek a refund of previously-paid access charges for
intraMTA traffic, as well as a discount related to intraMTA traffic on a going-forward basis. One of the Company s subsidiaries,
MMT, was named as a defendant in two of the lawsuits that are being brought before the District Court for the Western District
of Missouri (one filed on May 2, 2014 by Sprint and the other filed on September 5, 2014 by MCI and Verizon). In addition, one
of the Company s other subsidiaries, OTP, was named as a defendant in a lawsuit relating to these issues filed by MCI and
Verizon in the District Court for the District of Delaware on September 5, 2014. As all of the lawsuits relating to these issues
raise the same fundamental questions of law, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated the
lawsuits in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the  Court ) for all pre-trial proceedings. On November
17, 2015, the Court issued a memorandum opinion and order dismissing the federal-law claims with prejudice, dismissing the state-law
claims but granting leave to re-plead said claims, and denying the Defendants  request to refer the matter to the FCC. The
Court continues to handle pre-trial motions related to some LEC Defendants  counterclaims, with decisions on those matters
and final summary judgment motions not scheduled to occur until April of 2017. After all pre-trial matters are addressed, Sprint,
MCI and Verizon have indicated they will appeal the Court s November 17, 2015 decision making. Accordingly, it is not possible
to determine at this time whether these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 

On November 10, 2014,
a large coalition of the LEC Defendants, including MMT and OTP, filed a petition for declaratory ruling with the FCC seeking a
ruling by the FCC that: (1) any traffic intentionally routed over Interexchange carrier ( IXC ) trunks by IXCs should
be subject to access charges; (2) only carriers with specific agreements with an LEC may use alternative billing arrangements;
(3) federal tariffing rules require the LECs to assess access charges for switched access traffic routed through Feature Group
D trunks; and (4) the IXCs may not engage in self-help by refusing to pay the LEC Defendants  properly assessed access charges.
On March 11, 2015, the LEC Defendants filed their reply brief with the FCC. No timeline has been established for a decision by
the FCC and the FCC has given no indication that it intends to issue a ruling in the near future. Accordingly, it is not possible
to determine at this time whether this action will have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.  

7.    Stock Plans and Stock Associated with Acquisition    

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted RSUs underlying 119,655 shares of Class A common stock. The Company granted RSUs
underlying 122,534 shares of Class A common stock on May 15, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, 212,213 RSUs remained outstanding.
These RSUs (or a portion thereof) vest with respect to each recipient over a one to three year period from the date of grant, provided
the recipient remains in the employment or service of the Company as of the vesting date and, in selected instances, certain performance
criteria are attained. Additionally, these RSUs (or a portion thereof) could vest earlier in the event of a change in control of
the Company, or upon involuntary termination without cause. These grants are made primarily to executive-level personnel at the
Company and, as a result, no compensation costs have been capitalized. 

The following
table summarizes RSU activity as of September 30, 2016: 

CRC acquired substantially
all of the assets of Reliable Networks on January 2, 2014. Pursuant to the purchase agreement relating to the Reliable Networks
acquisition, Class A common stock was issued to the former owner of Reliable Networks in 2015 and will be issued to the former
owner of Reliable Networks in 2017, contingent on Reliable Networks achieving certain financial objectives and certain other conditions
being satisfied, including that certain individuals must be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and in good standing
on the last day of the applicable year (the  Earn-Out ). For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company delivered
68,233 shares of Class A common stock to the former owner of Reliable Networks on March 12, 2015 as a result of the Earn-Out. For
the year ended December 31, 2015, the applicable Earn-Out criteria was not met and no shares of Class A common stock were issued
as a result of the Earn-Out. No shares of Class A common stock were earned or issued as a result of the Earn-Out during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Stock-based compensation
expense related to RSUs and the Earn-Out was $311 thousand and $283 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Accounting standards require that the Company estimate forfeitures for RSUs and the Earn-Out and reduce compensation
expense accordingly. The Company has reduced its expense by the assumed forfeiture rate and will evaluate actual experience against
the assumed forfeiture rate going forward. The forfeiture rate has been developed using historical performance metrics which could
impact the number of the final share issuance of Class A common stock. 

As of September 30,
2016, the unrecognized total compensation cost related to unvested RSUs was $630 thousand. That cost is expected to be recognized
by the end of 2019. 

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

General 

Since 1999, we have
acquired and operate eleven rural local exchange carriers ( RLECs ) serving subscribers in north central Alabama, central
Maine, western Massachusetts, central Missouri, western Vermont and southern West Virginia. We are the sole wireline telephone
services provider for three of the rural communities we serve. We also operate a competitive local exchange carrier ( CLEC )
serving subscribers in Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Our services include a broad suite of communications and information
services including local and long distance telephone services; internet and data services; network access; other telephone related
services; cloud hosting and professional engineering services for small and mid-sized companies who rely on mission-critical software
applications; and video and security (in some markets). We view, manage and evaluate the results of operations from the various
telecommunications products and services as one company and therefore have identified one reporting segment as it relates to providing
segment information. As of September 30, 2016, we operated 95,327 access line equivalents. 

The Federal Communications
Commission (the  FCC ) issued its Universal Service Fund and Intercarrier Compensation Order (the  FCC Order )
in November 2011. This order makes substantial changes in the way telecommunications carriers are compensated for serving high
cost areas and for completing traffic with other carriers. We began seeing the significant impact of the FCC Order to our business
in July 2012, with additional impacts beginning in July 2013, July 2014 and July 2015. The initial consequence to our business
was to reduce access revenue from intrastate calling in Maine and other states where intrastate rates were higher than interstate
rates. Nationwide, all switched access rates will be reduced annually through July 2017 to less than $0.01 per minute. A portion
of this revenue loss for our RLEC properties is returned to us through the Connect America Fund. There is no recovery mechanism
for the lost revenue in our CLEC. 

In March 2016, the
FCC issued its Universal Service Fund Reform Order for rate-of-return carriers (the  USF Order ). This order fundamentally
changes the way that rural rate-of-return carriers obtain Universal Service Fund ( USF ) support. Specifically, the
USF Order will reduce the authorized rate-of-return from 11.25% to 9.75% over a six-year phase-in period beginning July 1, 2016,
impose a cap of $2 billion on USF available to rural rate-of-return carriers, introduce a new voluntary path under which rate-of-return
carriers may elect model-based support for a term of ten years, impose new broadband build-out requirements on carriers in return
for receiving USF, establish limitations on capital and operating expenses supported by USF for those rate-of-return carriers that
continue to utilize the modified legacy mechanisms for USF distribution and introduce the concept of a reverse auction for areas
that rate-of-return carriers are unable to serve. The USF Order requires carriers electing voluntary model-based support to notify
the FCC of their election by November 1, 2016. We have elected to accept the new model-based support for all of our RLECs that
are eligible, and we completed the notification of this election on October 31, 2016. As currently established, this election will
provide a slight positive impact on us, beginning in 2017. The FCC may revise the model-based support amounts after it receives
and reviews all of the rate-of-return companies  elections. If the FCC makes a revised model-based support offer that is
lower than the offer made at the time of our election, we will have 30 days to accept the new offer, or continue with the modified
legacy support mechanism. 

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included in Item 1 of Part I and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The following discussion and
analysis addresses our financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis. 

Revenue Sources 

We offer a wide range
of telecommunications, data, entertainment and managed services to our subscribers. More than half of our access line equivalents
serve business customers. Our residential customers purchase packages of services that are delivered and billed together. Our CLEC
subscribers contract with us for selected services that meet their specific telecommunications requirements. Our revenues are derived
from six sources: 

Local services . We receive revenues from providing local exchange telecommunications services
in our eleven rural territories and on a competitive basis throughout Maine, western Massachusetts and New Hampshire through both
wholesale and retail channels. These revenues include monthly subscription charges for basic service, calling beyond the local
territory on a fixed price and on a per minute basis, local private line services and enhanced calling features, such as voicemail,
caller identification, call waiting and call forwarding. We also provide billing and collections services for other carriers under
contract and receive revenues from directory advertising. A significant portion of our rural subscribers take bundled service plans
which contain multiple services, including unlimited domestic calling, for a flat monthly fee.   

Network access . We receive revenues from charges established to compensate us for the origination,
transport and termination of calls of long distance, wireless and other interexchange carriers. These include subscriber line charges   

imposed on end
users and switched and special access charges paid by carriers. Switched access charges for long distance services within Alabama,
Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia have historically been based on rates approved by the
Alabama Public Service Commission, the Maine Public Utilities Commission, the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and
Cable, the Missouri Public Service Commission, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, the Vermont Public Service Board
and the West Virginia Public Service Commission, respectively, where appropriate. The FCC Order preempted the state commissions 
authority to set terminating intrastate access service rates, and required companies with terminating access rates higher than
interstate rates to reduce terminating intrastate access rates to a rate equal to interstate access service rates by July 1, 2013
and to move to  bill and keep  arrangements by July 1, 2020, which will eliminate access charges between carriers.
The FCC Order prescribes a recovery mechanism for the recovery of any decrease in intrastate terminating access revenues through
the Connect America Fund for RLEC companies. This recovery is limited to 95% of the previous year s revenue requirement.
Switched and special access charges for interstate and international services are based on rates approved by the FCC. 

Internet . We receive revenues from monthly recurring charges for digital high-speed data
lines, legacy dial-up internet access and ancillary services such as web hosting, computer virus protection and Classifax, which
is our virtual faxing solution.   

Transport services . We receive monthly recurring revenues for the rental of fiber to transport
data and other telecommunications services in Maine and New Hampshire.   

Video and security . We offer basic, digital, high-definition, digital video recording, video
on demand and pay per view cable television services, including IP television ( IPTV ), to a portion of our telephone
service territory in Alabama. We provide medical alert and
home security systems in Alabama and Missouri, and selected over-the-top video services in Vermont.   

Managed services . We provide private/hybrid cloud hosting services, as well as consulting
and professional engineering services, for mission-critical software applications for small and mid-sized North American companies.
Revenues are generated from monthly recurring hosting IaaS fees, monthly maintenance fees,    la carte  professional
engineering services and pay-as-you-use SaaS fees. Services are domiciled in two diverse owned data centers. Our operations in-rack
and professional engineering services are covered by a SOC 2 Type II audit covering security, availability and confidentiality,
while our data center operations are covered by a separate SOC 2 Type II audit covering security and availability.   

Access Line and Customer
Trends 

The number of voice
and data access lines serves as a fundamental factor in determining revenue stability for a telecommunications provider. Reflecting
general trends in the RLEC industry, the number of residential voice access lines we serve has been decreasing when normalized
for territory acquisitions, whereas business access lines have remained generally steady or grown. We expect that these trends
will continue, and may be potentially impacted by competition from cable and co-operative electric providers in our RLEC territories,
the availability of alternative telecommunications products, such as cellular and IP-based services, as well as economic conditions
generally. Historically, these residential trends have been partially offset by the growth of residential data access lines, also
called digital high-speed internet access service. As the penetration of data lines in our RLEC markets has increased, residential
data line growth no longer offsets the decline in residential voice lines. Our competitive carrier voice and data access lines
have grown as we continue to offer new services and further penetrate our chosen markets. Our ability to continue this growth and
our response to the rural trends will have an important impact on our future revenues. Our primary strategy consists of leveraging
our strong incumbent market position, selling additional services to our rural customer base, such as alarm and medical alert monitoring
services, and providing better service and support levels and a broader suite of services, including managed services and hybrid/cloud-based
hosting, than the incumbent and other competitive carriers to our CLEC customer base. 

Key Operating Statistics  

  (unaudited)  

(1)  We define access line equivalents as retail and wholesale voice lines (including Classifax, our virtual faxing solution) and
data lines (including cable modems, digital subscriber lines and dedicated data access trunks).   

Our business and enterprise
access line equivalents increased by 959 during third quarter 2016, or 1.8%, compared to June 30, 2016. The growth in Hosted PBX
lines in our New England CLEC and business services for schools in our Alabama RLEC territory accounted for the growth. Business
and enterprise access line equivalents accounted for over 56% of our access line equivalents as of September 30, 2016. Residential
access line equivalents declined 862 during third quarter 2016, or 2.0%, compared to June 30, 2016, reflecting industry-wide trends.
Residential data lines declined at a much slower pace than residential voice access lines during third quarter 2016, as most customers
disconnecting their residential voice lines chose to retain their data services. 

We offer competitively-priced
location-specific bundled service packages, many including unlimited domestic calling, tailored to the varying telecommunications
requirements of our customers. Competitive pricing and bundling of services have led our long distance service to be the choice
of the majority of our voice customers in the rural markets we serve. In addition, almost all of our CLEC customers have selected
us as their long distance carrier. Our cable television, IPTV and over-the-top customers decreased 9.1% to 3,338 as of September
30, 2016, from 3,671 as of June 30, 2016, reflecting AT T s reseller channel decisions in its DirecTV  division.
Our other internet customers decreased 1.8% to 2,637 as of September 30, 2016 compared to 2,684 as of June 30, 2016. This also
includes the subscribers we service outside of our RLEC telephone service area in Maine and central Missouri. Approximately 78%
of the other internet customers are served by high-speed data capability from Otelco. We offer security monitoring and medical
alert services in Alabama and Missouri. During third quarter 2016, we installed 14 systems for an increase of 4.1% as of September
30, 2016 when compared to June 30, 2016. 

Our Rate and Pricing
Structure 

Our CLEC enterprise
pricing is based on market requirements. We combine varying services to meet individual customer requirements, including technical
support and managed services, and provide multi-year contracts which are both market sensitive for the customer and stabilizing
for our sales process. 

Our RLECs operate in
six states and are regulated in varying degrees by the respective state regulatory authorities. The impact on pricing flexibility
varies by state. Our rates for other services we provide, including cable, IPTV, satellite, long distance, data lines and dial-up
and high-speed internet access, are not price regulated. The market for competitive services, such as wireless, also impacts our
ability to adjust prices. With the increase of bundled services offerings, including unlimited long distance, pricing for individual
services takes on reduced importance to revenue stability. We expect this trend to continue into the immediate future. 

Categories of Operating
Expenses 

Our operating expenses
are categorized as cost of services; selling, general and administrative expenses; and depreciation and amortization. 

Cost of services .
This includes expenses for salaries, wages and benefits relating to our telephone central office and outside plant operation, maintenance,
sales and customer service; other plant operations, maintenance and administrative costs; network access costs; data center operations;
and costs of services for long distance, cable television, internet and directory services. 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses . This includes expenses for salaries, wages and benefits and contract service payments (for example,
legal fees) relating to engineering, financial, human resources and corporate operations; information management expenses, including
billing; allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable; expenses for travel, lodging and meals; internal and external communications
costs; insurance premiums; stock exchange and banking fees; and postage. 

Depreciation and
amortization . This includes depreciation of our telecommunications, cable and internet networks and equipment, and amortization
of intangible assets. Certain of these amortization expenses continue to be deductible for tax purposes. 

Our Ability to Control
Operating Expenses 

We strive to control
expenses in order to maintain our operating margins. As our revenue shifts to non-regulated services and CLEC customers and our
residential RLEC revenue declines, operating margins decrease, reflecting the lower margins associated with non-regulated services.
Reductions over time in USF and Intercarrier Compensation payments based on the FCC Order may not be fully offset by expense control. 

Results of Operations 

The following table
sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated: 

Three Months and Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Total revenues .
Total revenues decreased 2.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $17.4 million from $17.9 million in the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Total revenues decreased 2.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $52.1 million from $53.4
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue due to the FCC Order and the loss of residential access
lines account for the majority of the decline. The tables below provide the components of our revenues for the three months and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of 2015. 

For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Local services .
Local services revenue decreased 4.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $6.0 million from $6.3 million in the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Hosted PBX and fiber rental revenue increased $0.2 million. T he
decline in RLEC residential voice access lines and the impact of the  FCC Order, which reduces or eliminates intrastate and
local cellular revenue,  account for a decrease of $0.3 million.  A portion of the RLEC
decrease is recovered through the Connect America Fund, which is categorized as interstate access revenue. Long distance and special
line revenue decreased $0.2 million. 

Network access .
Network access revenue decreased 5.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $5.3 million from $5.6 million in the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The Connect America Fund and end user charges increased $0.1 million. This increase was offset
by declines in special access charges of $0.1 million, interstate and intrastate switched access charges of $0.2 million and end-user
fees of $0.1 million. 

Internet . Internet
revenue increased 6.2% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $4.0 million from $3.7 million in the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Increased broadband speed, higher equipment rental fees and pricing accounted for the increase. 

Transport services .
Transport services revenue decreased 13.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $1.2 million from $1.4 million in the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction of carrier circuits and market repricing accounted for the decline. 

Video and security .
Video and security revenue increased 4.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to just over $0.7 million from just under
$0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Increases in security and IPTV deployment and cable pricing were partially
offset by decreases in pay per view revenue and digital cable subscribers and the end of our DirecTV  resale agreement. 

Managed services .
Managed services revenue decreased 5.4% to remain at just over $0.2 million in both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was in equipment sales and groupware services. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Local services .
Local services revenue decreased 5.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $17.9 million from $18.9 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Hosted PBX and fiber rental revenue increased $0.2 million. T he
decline in RLEC residential voice access lines and the impact of the  FCC Order  account
for a decrease of $0.7 million.  A portion of the RLEC decrease is recovered through the Connect America Fund, which is categorized
as interstate access revenue. Long distance and special line revenue decreased $0.5 million. 

Network access .
Network access revenue decreased 3.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $16.0 million from $16.7 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The Connect America Fund increased $0.3 million. This increase was offset by declines in special
access charges of $0.5 million, interstate and intrastate switched access charges of $0.3 million and end-user fees of $0.1 million. 

Internet . Internet
revenue increased 5.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $11.7 million from $11.1 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Increased broadband speed, higher equipment rental fees, the introduction of its satellite-based Internet service
iSpeed in Missouri and pricing accounted for the increase. 

Transport services .
Transport services revenue decreased 7.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $3.7 million from $4.0 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction of carrier circuits and market repricing accounted for the decline. 

Video and security .
Video and security revenue increased 4.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $2.2 million from $2.1 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Increases in security and IPTV deployment and cable pricing were partially offset by decreases
in pay per view revenue and digital cable subscribers and the end of our DirecTV  resale agreement. 

Managed services .
Managed services revenue was $0.7 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The increase
in engineering and professional services revenue was offset by the decline in cloud hosting revenue. 

Operating expenses .
Operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 0.9% to $12.8 million from $12.9 million in the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 3.3% to $37.9 million
from $39.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The tables below provide the components of our operating expenses
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of 2015. 

For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Cost of services .
Cost of services decreased 4.1% to $8.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $8.3 million in the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Internet, access, toll and digital circuit equipment expense decreased $0.3 million and other expense
associated with our New England operations optimization decreased by $0.1 million. Cable television programming costs and computer
expense increased $0.1 million.

and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.5% to $2.9 million in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from $2.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Board of Directors related project expenses
of $0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 had no comparable expenses in the three months ended September 30,
2015. Small increases in external relations, insurance and uncollectible expense accounted for the balance of the increase. 

Depreciation and
amortization . Depreciation and amortization decreased 9.1% to $2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$2.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. New England CLEC decreased $0.1 million and Alabama cable depreciation
and the amortization of other intangible assets decreased $0.1 million. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Cost of services .
Cost of services decreased 4.0% to $24.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $25.0 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Toll and digital circuit equipment expense decreased by $0.4 million, access expense decreased by $0.3
million, pole, power and conduit expense decreased by $0.3 million, other expense associated with our New England operations optimization
decreased by $0.3 million and internet expense decreased by $0.1 million. Performance assurance plan billing credits received from
Fairpoint Communications in Maine decreased by $0.2 million, effectively increasing our cost as their service levels showed further
improvement and the related credits decreased. In addition, cable television programming costs and computer expense increased $0.2
million. 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.3% to $7.9 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from $7.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Board of Directors related project expenses
of $0.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 had no comparable expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The earlier timing of audit expense accounted for an increase of $0.1 million, increased loan fees accounted for $0.1 million and
higher non-cash stock compensation cost accounted for $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in uncollectible,
external relations, human resources and property tax expense of $0.3 million. 

Depreciation and
amortization . Depreciation and amortization decreased 9.3% to $6.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from
$6.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. New England CLEC depreciation decreased 

$0.2 million, the amortization
of other intangible assets decreased $0.2 million, Alabama cable television and internet depreciation decreased $0.2 million and
New England RLEC depreciation decreased $0.1 million. Alabama and Missouri RLEC depreciation increased by $0.1 million. 

For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Interest expense .
Interest expense increased 40.0% to $2.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.9 million in the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Higher interest rates on our new loan facilities accounted for an increase of $0.7 million and the increase
in loan cost amortization accounted for an increase of $0.1 million. 

Other income .
Other income was not material in either the three months ended September 30, 2016 or three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Income tax expense .
Provision for income tax expense was $0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.1 million in the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective income tax rate as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 39.1% and
39.8%, respectively. In December 2015, changes in tax law related to bonus depreciation were enacted, impacting both the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Interest expense .
Interest expense increased 32.4% to $7.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $6.0 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Higher interest rates on our new loan facilities accounted for an increase of $1.5 million and the increased
loan cost amortization accounted for an increase of $0.4 million. 

Other income .
Other income decreased 41.1% to $0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in the annual CoBank dividend in first quarter 2016 accounted for the decrease. 

Income tax expense .
Provision for income tax expense was $2.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.6 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The effective income tax rate as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 39.1% and
39.8%, respectively. In December 2015, changes in tax law related to bonus depreciation were enacted, impacting both the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net income .
As a result of the foregoing, there was net income of $1.1 million and $1.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. As a result of the foregoing, there was net income of $4.2 million and $5.7 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The differences are primarily attributable to lower residential and access revenues
in both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the smaller CoBank dividend received in first quarter 2016,
partially offset by continued cost reductions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity needs
arise primarily from: (i) interest and principal payments related to our credit facilities; (ii) capital expenditures for investment
in our business; and (iii) working capital requirements. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we generated cash from our business to invest in additional property and equipment of $4.1 million, pay
loan origination costs of $5.2 million, pay scheduled interest on our debt of $6.1 million and pay income taxes of $0.5 million.
As described in greater detail below, we fully repaid our previous credit facility that was scheduled to mature in April 2016 with
borrowings under two new credit agreements, both of which are scheduled to mature in 2021. After reflecting the above changes in
our business, cash increased to $9.3 million as of September 30, 2016 when compared to $6.9 million as of December 31, 2015. 

Cash flows from operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $13.7 million compared to $15.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net income associated with the CoBank dividend and the reduction in prepaid expenses
and other assets and accounts receivable primarily accounted for the difference. 

Cash flows used in
investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4.1 million compared to $4.6 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Lower investment in property and equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 accounted for
the difference. 

Cash flows used in
financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $7.1 million compared to $10.1 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, reflecting changes associated with our credit facilities, primarily loan origination costs for the facilities
and the change in principal payment date from the last day of the quarter with respect to the former facility to the first day
of the following quarter with respect to the current senior facility. 

We do not invest in
financial instruments as part of our business strategy. 

As mentioned above,
our prior credit facility was scheduled to mature in April 2016. However, on January 25, 2016, we entered into a new senior credit
facility, providing for a five year term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $85.0 million and a five year
$5.0 million revolving credit facility, and a new subordinated credit facility, providing for a five and a half year term loan
facility in the aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million. On February 17, 2016, the subordinated credit facility was
amended to increase the aggregate principal amount available for borrowing thereunder to $15.3 million, and we borrowed $85.0 million
under the term loan facility of the senior credit facility and $15.3 million under the subordinated credit facility. We used the
borrowings under the credit facilities to, among other things, pay all amounts due, including principal, interest and fees, and
satisfy in full all of our obligations under our previous credit facility. Under the current senior credit facility, excess cash
flow payments are made annually rather than quarterly as they were under our previous credit facility. 

We use consolidated
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Consolidated EBITDA ) as an operational performance
measurement. Consolidated EBITDA, as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, corresponds to the definition of Consolidated
EBITDA in our credit facilities. Consolidated EBITDA, as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is a supplemental measure
of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ( U.S. GAAP ). The lenders under our credit facilities use this measure to determine compliance with credit
facility requirements. We report Consolidated EBITDA in our quarterly earnings press release to allow current and potential investors
to understand this performance metric and because we believe that it provides current and potential investors with helpful information
with respect to our operating performance. However, Consolidated EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income
or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of Consolidated EBITDA may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Consolidated EBITDA for the three months and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, and its reconciliation to net income, is reflected in the table below (in thousands): 

Recent Developments 

We have retained The
Bank Street Group LLC as our financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives that would enhance stockholder value. These alternatives
could include a broad range of merger and sale transactions, among other things. However, there can be no assurance that our review
of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction. We do not currently intend to make further public comment regarding our
strategic review and exploration process, except as required by applicable law. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 1,  Organization
and Basis of Financial Reporting , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for a description of the recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Our short-term excess
cash balance is invested in short-term commercial paper. We do not invest in any derivative or commodity type instruments. Accordingly,
we are subject to minimal market risk on our investments. 

Interest rates applicable
to the term loans and the revolving loans under our senior credit facility are set at a margin over a LIBOR rate (which is defined
as the higher of  (1) LIBOR and (2) 1.0% per annum) or a reference rate (which is generally defined as the highest of 
(1) 3.5% per annum, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (3) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00% per annum and (4) the prime
rate). Accordingly, we are exposed to interest rate risk. If our current senior credit facility had been in place for the full
period, and assuming $85.0 million was outstanding under that facility from January 1, 2016 through February 16, 2016 (the date
immediately before the date that we actually drew down funds under that facility), a one percentage point change in market interest
rates from the September 30, 2016 interest rates would have resulted in an approximately $282 thousand increase in the interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 

With the participation
of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,
2016. 

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
