NOTE 1   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  As used in this report, the term  Company,  except as otherwise indicated by the context, means Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries for which it has a controlling interest.   
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all legal entities in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest.  The Company is also considered to have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity ( VIE ) if the Company determines it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  Investments in legal entities in which the Company does not own a majority interest but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method.  
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, these unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  However, in the opinion of management, these unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods.  Operating results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31,   2016  . 
  The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to current year classifications.  
  Venezuela   Deconsolidation 
  Effective June 30, 2016, the Company determined that deteriorating conditions in Venezuela had led the Company to no longer meet the accounting criteria for control over its Venezuelan subsidiary.  The restrictive exchange controls in Venezuela and the lack of access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuela bolivar and the U.S. dollar, and restricted the Venezuela operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.  Additionally, other operating restrictions including government controls on pricing, profits, imports and restrictive labor laws significantly impacted the Company s ability to make key operational decisions, including the ability to manage its capital structure, purchasing, product pricing and labor relations.  Therefore, as of June 30, 2016, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of its subsidiary in Venezuela and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting. 
  As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recorded a pretax charge of   $34,348   (  $33,251   after-tax) in the second quarter of 2016.  The pretax charge includes the write-off of the Company s investment in Venezuela, including all inter-company balances and   $283   of Cash and cash equivalents.  Additionally, the charge includes foreign currency translation losses and pension losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  Beginning July 1, 2016, the Company no longer includes the results of the Venezuelan subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements.  Under the cost method of accounting, if cash were to be received from the Venezuela entity in future periods from the sale of inventory, dividends or royalties, income would be recognized.  The Company does not anticipate dividend or royalty payments being made in the foreseeable future and has had no purchases from or sales to the Venezuela entity since it was deconsolidated.  The factors that led to the Company s conclusion to deconsolidate at June 30, 2016 continued to exist through September 30, 2016.  The Company expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.  
  Subsequent to the deconsolidation under the voting interest consolidation model, the Company determined that the Venezuelan subsidiary is considered to be a VIE.  As the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Venezuela subsidiary's economic performance, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore would not consolidate the entity under the VIE consolidation model.  Due to the lack of ability to settle U.S. dollar obligations, the Company does not intend to sell into nor purchase inventory from the Venezuela entity at this time.  Additionally, the Company has no remaining financial commitments to the Venezuelan subsidiary and therefore believes the exposure to future losses are not material.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 

Prior to deconsolidation, the financial statements of the Company s Venezuelan operation had been reported under highly inflationary accounting rules since January 1, 2010.  Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company s Venezuelan operation had been remeasured into the Company s reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities were reflected in current earnings.   
  In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the Marginal Currency System ("SIMADI"), which allows for trading based on supply and demand.  At September 30, 2015, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SIMADI rate (now known as "DICOM"), as the SIMADI rate most appropriately approximated the rates used to transact business in its Venezuelan operations.  At September 30, 2015, the SIMADI rate was   199.4   bolivars to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a remeasurement charge on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of   $4,334  .  This foreign exchange loss was recorded in Selling, general   administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Additionally, the Company recorded lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments of   $22,880   within Cost of goods sold, related to the adoption of the SIMADI rate. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements Yet to be Adopted: 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15,   "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."    The objective of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce existing diversity in practice by addressing eight specific cash flow issues related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  If early adopted, an entity must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on the Company's financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."    ASU 2016-13 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.  The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decrease of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period.  The amendment should be applied using a modified-retrospective approach, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on the Company's financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."    ASU 2016-09 amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  If early adopted, an entity must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on the Company's financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   "Leases (Topic 842)."    ASU 2016-02 aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing agreements.  Entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."    ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  To achieve that core principle, the amendment provides five steps that an entity should apply when recognizing revenue.  The amendment also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers.  An entity can either adopt this amendment retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of initial application.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,"   which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements. 

NOTE 2   EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , common shares subject to equity-based awards of   803,741   and   1,279,664  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their exercise would be anti-dilutive.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , common shares subject to equity-based awards of   807,763   and   508,070  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their exercise would be anti-dilutive.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, special items within Corporate/Eliminations reflect a loss on the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary. 
  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, special items in International Welding reflect rationalization activity charges and charges related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.  Americas Welding special items include rationalization activity charges, charges related to pension settlements and Venezuelan foreign exchange remeasurement losses related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism.  

NOTE 5   RATIONALIZATION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS 
  In prior periods, the Company initiated various rationalization plans whose costs were substantially recognized in the prior year.   As such, no charges were recorded in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  A description of each restructuring plan and the related costs follows: 
  Americas Welding Plans: 
  During 2015, the Company initiated a rationalization plan within Americas Welding that included a voluntary separation incentive program covering certain U.S.-based employees.  The plan was completed during 2016.  
  International Welding Plans: 
  During 2015, the Company initiated rationalization plans within International Welding.  The plans include headcount restructuring to better align cost structures with economic conditions and operating needs.  The Company does not anticipate any additional charges related to the completion of these plans.  At   September 30, 2016  , liabilities relating to the International Welding plans of   $6,199   were recognized in Other current liabilities.  
  The Company believes the rationalization actions will positively impact future results of operations and will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital.  The Company continues to evaluate its cost structure and additional rationalization actions may result in charges in future periods.  The following table summarizes the activity related to the rationalization liabilities by segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :

    The reclassification from AOCI reflects foreign currency translation losses recognized due to the Company's deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary.  (See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies for additional details.) 

NOTE 7   INVENTORY VALUATION 
  The valuation of last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.  Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.  Actual year-end costs and inventory levels may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations.  The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was   $62,239   at   September 30, 2016   and   $59,765   at   December 31, 2015  .

NOTE 8   ACCRUED EMPLOYEE BONUS 
  Other current liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include accruals for year-end bonuses and related payroll taxes of   $69,433     and   $87,542  , respectively, related to the Company s employees worldwide.  The payment of bonuses is discretionary and subject to approval by the Board of Directors.  A majority of annual bonuses are paid in December, resulting in an increasing bonus accrual during the Company s fiscal year.    

NOTE 9   CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.  The claimants in the asbestos cases seek compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts.  The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to contest such suits vigorously. 
  The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.  If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.  Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.  Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.  Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.  Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.  Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves. 
  Based on the Company's historical experience in litigating product liability claims, including a significant number of dismissals, summary judgments and defense verdicts in many cases and immaterial settlement amounts, as well as the Company's current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, the Company believes resolution of these claims and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 10   PRODUCT WARRANTY COSTS 
  The changes in the carrying amount of product warranty accruals for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:

NOTE 11           DEBT 
  Revolving Credit Agreement 
  The Company has a line of credit totaling   $400,000   through the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), which was entered into on   September 12, 2014  .  The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, transactions with affiliates and a fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio.    As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants   and had   $155,000   in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement which was recorded in Short-term debt.  The Credit Agreement has a   five  -year term and may be increased, subject to certain conditions, by an additional amount up to   $100,000  .

  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On   April 1, 2015  , the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it agreed to issue senior unsecured notes (the "2015 Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of   $350,000   through a private placement.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $349,189  , net of debt issuance costs of   $811   and excluding accretion of original issuance costs, was outstanding and recorded in Long-term debt, less current portion.  The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.

NOTE 12           RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
  The components of total pension cost were as follows: 

1 
    The amortization of net loss includes a   $959   charge resulting from the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
     The Company voluntarily contributed   $20,086   to its defined benefit plans in the United States during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The decrease in the components of total pension cost for the defined benefit plans in 2016 was primarily due to the purchase of a group annuity contract in August 2015, which triggered a settlement loss. 
  In October 2016, the Company announced an amendment to The Lincoln Electric Company Retirement Annuity Program ( RAP ) to cease all benefit accruals for participants under the RAP effective as of December 31, 2016.  The RAP currently includes approximately   1,500   domestic employees who will fully transition to The Lincoln Electric Company Employee Savings Plan ( Savings Plan ), a defined contribution retirement savings plan.  Additionally, in October 2016, the Company announced an amendment to the Savings Plan to allow eligible employees to receive company contributions through a combination of matching and automatic employer contributions. 

NOTE 13   INCOME TAXES 
  The Company recognized   $54,264   of tax expense on pretax income of   $199,236  , resulting in an effective income tax rate of   27.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The effective income tax rate was   20.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The 2016 effective income tax rate was lower than the Company s statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of U.S. tax credits, income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance as a result of a legal entity change and an income tax benefit related to a worthless stock deduction of a foreign subsidiary.  The 2015 effective income tax rate was lower than the Company s statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of U.S. tax credits, income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance and a pension settlement charge s deferred tax benefit recorded at the higher U.S. statutory rate. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $16,447   of unrecognized tax benefits.  If recognized, approximately   $10,860   would be reflected as a component of income tax expense. 
  The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012.  The Company is currently subject to various U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax audits.   
  Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statutes of limitations.  Based on information currently available, management believes that additional audit activity could be completed and/or statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits.  It is reasonably possible there could be a reduction of   $2,059   in previously unrecognized tax benefits by the end of the   third quarter     2017  .

NOTE 14   DERIVATIVES 
  The Company uses derivatives to manage exposures to currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices arising in the normal course of business.  Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are assessed as to their effectiveness, when applicable.    Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments.  Counterparties include a number of major banks and financial institutions.  None of the concentrations of risk with any individual counterparty was considered significant at   September 30, 2016  .  The Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  Certain foreign currency forward contracts were qualified and designated as cash flow hedges.  The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these short-term contracts was   $42,501   at   September 30, 2016   and   $30,388   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Fair Value Hedges 
  Certain interest rate swap agreements were qualified and designated as fair value hedges.  The interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.  Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these agreements are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.  The effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in Non-current assets or Other long-term liabilities with offsetting amounts recorded as a fair value adjustment to the carrying value of Long-term debt, less current portion.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert notional amounts of   $25,000   of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on three-month LIBOR plus a spread. 
  Net Investment Hedges 
  The Company has foreign currency forward contracts that were qualified and designated as net investment hedges.  No such contracts were outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  The Company has certain foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as hedges.  These derivatives are held as economic hedges of certain balance sheet exposures.  The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these contracts was $  285,826   at   September 30, 2016   and   $267,626   at   December 31, 2015  .   
  The Company had short-term silver forward contracts with notional amounts of   $2,804   at     December 31, 2015  .

The following table provides a summary of assets and liabilities as of   December 31, 2015  , measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Company s derivative contracts are valued at fair value using the market approach.  The Company measures the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements using Level 2 inputs based on observable spot and forward rates in active markets.  The Company measures the fair value of commodity contracts using Level 2 inputs through observable market transactions in active markets provided by financial institutions.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3. 
  In connection with acquisitions, the Company recorded contingent considerations fair valued at   $9,377   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Under the contingent consideration agreements, the amounts to be paid are based upon actual financial results of the acquired entities for specified future periods.  The fair value of the contingent considerations are a Level 3 valuation and fair valued using probability weighted discounted cash flow analyses. 
  In connection with an acquisition, the Company obtained a controlling financial interest in the acquired entity and at the same time entered into a contract to obtain the remaining financial interest in the entity over a   three  -year period.  The amount to be paid to obtain the remaining financial interest will be based upon actual financial results of the entity through 2016.  A liability was recorded for the forward contract at a fair value of   $14,489   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The change in liability from   December 31, 2015   was primarily the result of a   $14,438   payment to acquire an additional financial interest in the entity offset by foreign exchange translation and additional accruals recorded to interest expense of   $260   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of the contract is a Level 3 valuation and is based on the present value of the expected future payments.  The expected future payments are based on a multiple of forecasted earnings and cash flows over the three-year period ending December 31, 2016, present valued utilizing a risk based discount rate of   3.5%   reflective of the Company's cost of debt and   13.6%   as a risk adjusted cost of capital. 
  The deferred compensation liability is the Company s obligation under its executive deferred compensation plan.  The Company measures the fair value of the liability using the market values of the participants  underlying investment fund elections. 
  The fair value of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Short-term debt excluding the current portion of long-term debt and Trade accounts payable approximated book value due to the short-term nature of these instruments at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The fair value of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , including the current portion, was approximately   $375,548   and   $342,602  , respectively, which was determined using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment.  The carrying value of this debt at such dates was   $359,975   and   $351,803  , respectively.  Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount that could be realized in a current market exchange.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts  ) 
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  General 
  The Company is the world s largest designer and manufacturer of arc welding and cutting products, manufacturing a broad line of arc welding equipment, consumable welding products and other welding and cutting products.  Welding products include arc welding power sources, CNC and plasma cutters, wire feeding systems, robotic welding packages, integrated automation systems, fume extraction equipment, consumable electrodes, fluxes and welding accessories. The Company's product offering also includes oxy-fuel cutting systems and regulators and torches used in oxy-fuel welding, cutting and brazing. In addition, the Company has a leading global position in the brazing and soldering alloys market. 
  The Company s products are sold in both domestic and international markets.  In North America, products are sold principally through industrial distributors, retailers and directly to users of welding products.  Outside of North America, the Company has an international sales organization comprised of Company employees and agents who sell products from the Company s various manufacturing sites to distributors and product users.  
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its organizational and leadership structure into   three   operating segments to support growth strategies and enhance the utilization of the Company s worldwide resources and global sourcing initiatives.  The operating segments consist of Americas Welding, International Welding and The Harris Products Group.  The Americas Welding segment includes welding operations in North and South America.  The International Welding segment primarily includes welding operations in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.  The Harris Products Group includes the Company s global cutting, soldering and brazing businesses as well as its retail business in the United States.  All prior period results have been revised to reflect the realigned segment structure. 
  As further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective June 30, 2016, the Company determined that it no longer had control of its subsidiary in Venezuela as a result of restrictive exchange controls and Venezuelan operating restrictions that have significantly impacted the ability to make key operational decisions.  As a result, the Company has deconsolidated its subsidiary in Venezuela. The results of the Venezuelan subsidiary are no longer included in the current period consolidated financial statements starting in the third quarter of 2016.

Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Net Sales:    Net sales for the   third quarter   of   2016     decreased     12.0%   from the   third quarter     2015  .  The sales   decrease   reflects volume   decreases   of   12.8%  , or 7.8% excluding Venezuela, price   decreases   of   0.7%  , and   unfavorable   impacts from foreign exchange of   0.6%   offset by increases from acquisitions of 2.1%.  Sales volumes decreased primarily as a result of softer demand associated with the current economic environment and weakness in oil   gas and U.S. export markets.  The increase in Net sales from acquisitions was driven by acquired companies within Americas Welding. 
  Gross Profit:    Gross profit   increased     0.5%   to   $199,812   for the   third quarter     2016   compared with   $198,894   in the   third quarter     2015  .  As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit   increased   to   35.2%   in the   third quarter     2016   from   30.8%   in the   third quarter     2015  .  The   third quarter 2016   includes a LIFO charge of   $452   compared with a credit of   $4,062   in the prior year period.  The third quarter 2015 also includes a   $22,172   lower of cost or market inventory adjustment in Venezuela related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism. 
  Selling, General   Administrative ( SG A ) Expenses:    SG A expenses were   lower   by   $10,316  , or   8.0%  , in the   third quarter     2016   compared with the   third quarter   of   2015  .  As a percentage of Net sales, SG A expenses were   20.8%   and   19.9%   in the   third quarter     2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The   decrease   in SG A expenses was predominantly due to lower bonus expense of   $8,183   and lower foreign exchange transaction losses of   $3,685  , partially offset by incremental SG A from acquisitions of   $2,320  .      Foreign currency exchange rates had a   $3,998   favorable translation impact on SG A expenses.  
  Rationalization and Asset Impairment Charges:   In the third quarter 2015, the Company recorded $12,195 in net rationalization charges primarily related to employee severance and other related costs.  The Company also recorded non-cash charges of $6,090 primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.  No rationalization or asset impairment charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2016. See Note 5, "Rationalization and Asset Impairments" for additional information. 
  Pension Settlement Charges:   In the third quarter 2015, the Company recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of $136,331, $83,341 after-tax, primarily related to the purchase of a group annuity contract.  No pension settlement charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2016.  See Note 12, "Retirement and Postretirement Benefit Plans" for additional information. 
  Interest Expense:    Interest expense   decreased   to   $3,815   in the   third quarter     2016   from   $5,803   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The decrease is due to an adjustment in the prior-year period to the consideration expected to be paid to acquire additional ownership interests of a majority-owned subsidiary.

Income Taxes:    The Company recognized   $20,257   of tax expense on pretax income of   $80,296  , resulting in an effective income tax rate of   25.2%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with an effective income tax rate of   31.7%   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The effective income tax rate is lower in the current period as compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   due to a $4,028 income tax benefit related to a worthless stock deduction of a foreign subsidiary. 
  Net Income:    Net income for the   third quarter     2016   was   $60,049   compared with a net loss of   $60,466   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  Diluted earnings per share for the   third quarter     2016   were   $0.89   compared with a net loss per diluted share of   $0.82   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  Reported net income in the third quarter of 2015 includes non-cash pension settlement charges of $83,341, non-cash Venezuelan remeasurement losses of $26,506 related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism and net rationalization and asset impairment charges of $16,832. 
   
  Segment Results 
  Net Sales:    The table below summarizes the impacts of volume, acquisitions, price and foreign currency exchange rates on Net sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  : 

Net sales volumes for the   third quarter   of   2016   decreased for Americas Welding and International Welding due to softer demand associated with the current economic environment and weakness in oil and gas markets.   Americas Welding volumes also decreased due to weakness in U.S. exports and the deconsolidation of Venezuela.  Volumes increased for The Harris Products Group primarily from the retail market.  The pricing decrease in the Americas Welding segment was the result of lower raw material costs and sales mix.  The increase in Net sales from acquisitions was driven by the acquisition of Vizient Manufacturing Solutions ("Vizient") and Rimrock Holdings Corporation ("Rimrock") within Americas Welding (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's recent acquisitions).  The Americas Welding and International Welding sales decreased due to a stronger U.S. dollar.

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes ( Adjusted EBIT ):    Segment performance is measured and resources are allocated based on a number of factors, the primary profit measure being Adjusted EBIT.  EBIT is defined as Operating income plus Equity earnings in affiliates and Other income.  Segment EBIT is adjusted for special items as determined by management such as the impact of rationalization activities, certain asset impairment charges and gains or losses on disposals of assets.  The following table presents Adjusted EBIT for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   by segment compared with the comparable period in   2015  : 

Adjusted EBIT decreased for Americas Welding and International Welding in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared with the same period of the prior year primarily due to lower volumes, offset by lower bonus expense and input costs.  The increase in The Harris Products Group is primarily due to higher volumes and improved margins from favorable mix. 
  There were no special items recorded in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, special items include charges of $3,341 and $8,920 in Americas Welding and International Welding, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and other costs.  Americas Welding special items also include pension settlement charges of $136,331 and Venezuelan foreign exchange remeasurement losses of $26,506 related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism.  International Welding special items also reflect net charges of $6,024 related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and adjustments to reclassify a potential divestiture as held for use.

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    

Net Sales:    Net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     13.1%   from the comparable period in   2015  .  The sales   decrease   reflects volume   decreases   of   12.2%  , or 9.9% excluding Venezuela, and   unfavorable   impacts from foreign exchange of   16.3%   offset by price   increases   of   13.2%   and   increases   from acquisitions of   2.2%  .  Sales volumes decreased as a result of softer demand associated with the current economic environment and weakness in oil   gas and U.S. export markets.  Product pricing increased from prior year levels, reflecting the highly inflationary environment in Venezuela impacting results in the first six months of 2016.  Excluding Venezuela, pricing and foreign exchange had unfavorable impacts of   0.9%   and   1.5%  , respectively. The increase in Net sales from acquisitions was driven by acquired companies within Americas Welding.  
  Gross Profit:    Gross profit   decreased     8.3%   to   $591,841   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   $645,065   in the comparable period in   2015  .  As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit increased to   34.6%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   32.8%   in the comparable period in   2015  .  The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   includes a LIFO charge of   $2,474   compared with a credit of   $7,208   in the prior year period.  The prior year period also includes a $22,172 lower of cost or market inventory adjustment in Venezuela related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism. 
  SG A:    SG A expenses were   lower   by   $33,655  , or   8.7%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the comparable period in   2015  .  As a percentage of Net sales, SG A expenses were   20.6%   and   19.6%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The   decrease   in SG A expenses was primarily due to lower bonus expense of   $20,201  , lower foreign exchange transaction losses of   $10,970   and lower salaries and wages of   $3,510  , partially offset by incremental SG A from acquisitions of   $9,040  .  Foreign currency exchange rates had a   $9,901   favorable translation impact on SG A expenses. 
  Rationalization and Asset Impairment Charges:   In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $13,434 in net rationalization charges primarily related to employee severance and other related costs.  The Company also recorded noncash charges of $6,090 related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.  See Note 5, "Rationalization and Asset Impairments" for additional information. 
  Pension Settlement Charges:   In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded non-cash pension settlement charges of $136,331, $83,341 after-tax, related to the purchase of a group annuity contract.  See Note 12, "Retirement and Post-retirement Benefit Plans" for additional information.

Loss on Deconsolidation of Venezuelan Subsidiary:   In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a loss of   $34,348  ,   $33,251   after-tax, related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary.   See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Other Income:    Other income decreased to   $2,552   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3,223   in the comparable period in   2015  .  The decrease was the result of a gain associated with the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary and the related non-controlling interest in   2015  . 
  Interest Expense:    Interest expense   decreased   to   $11,828   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $12,034   in the comparable period in   2015  .  The decrease is due to an adjustment in the prior-year period to the consideration expected to be paid to acquire additional ownership interests of a majority-owned subsidiary. 
  Income Taxes:    The Company recognized   $54,264   of tax expense on pretax income of   $199,236  , resulting in an effective income tax rate of   27.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with an effective income tax rate of   20.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The lower effective income tax rate in the prior period is primarily due to a pension settlement charge s deferred tax benefit recorded at the higher statutory rate.  Additionally, the effective income tax rate is higher in the current period due to the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela, partially offset by the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance as the result of a legal entity change and an income tax benefit related to a worthless stock deduction of a foreign subsidiary. 
  Net Income:    Net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $145,004   compared with Net income of   $78,786   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Diluted earnings per share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $2.11   compared with   $1.04   in the comparable period in   2015  .  Reported net income in 2016 includes a loss related to the deconsolidation of the Company's Venezuelan subsidiary of $33,251 partially offset by reduced income taxes of $7,196 from the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance as a result of a legal entity change.   Reported net income in 2015 includes non-cash pension settlement charges of $83,341, non-cash Venezuelan remeasurement losses of $26,506 related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism and net rationalization and asset impairment charges of $17,732. 
   
  Segment Results 
  Net Sales:    The table below summarizes the impacts of volume, acquisitions, price and foreign currency exchange rates on Net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

26 

     Table of Contents  

Net sales volumes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased for Americas Welding and International Welding due to softer demand associated with the current economic environment and weakness in oil   gas markets.  Americas Welding volumes also decreased due to weakness in U.S. exports.  Volumes increased for The Harris Products Group primarily from the retail market.  The product pricing increase was driven by Americas Welding due to the highly inflationary environment in Venezuela.  Excluding Venezuela, pricing had a   0.9%   unfavorable impact on sales in the quarter.  The increase in Net sales from acquisitions was driven by the acquisition of Vizient and Rimrock within Americas Welding (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's recent acquisitions).  All segments sales decreased due to the translation effect of a stronger U.S. dollar.  Excluding Venezuela, foreign exchange had a   1.5%   unfavorable impact on sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Adjusted EBIT:    The following table presents Adjusted EBIT for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   by segment compared with the comparable period in   2015  : 

Adjusted EBIT decreased for Americas Welding and International Welding in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared with the same period of the prior year primarily due to volume decreases.  The increase in The Harris Products Group is primarily due to favorable sales mix associated with volume increases. 
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , special items within Corporate/Eliminations include a loss of   $34,348   related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary.  

27 

     Table of Contents  

In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, special items include charges of $3,341 and $10,159 in Americas Welding and International Welding, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and other costs.  Americas Welding special items also include pension settlement charges of $136,331 and Venezuelan foreign exchange remeasurement losses of $26,506 related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism. International Welding special items also reflect net charges of $6,024 related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and adjustments to reclassify a potential divestiture as held for use. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share and Return on invested capital are non-GAAP financial measures.  Management uses non-GAAP measures to assess the Company's operating performance by excluding certain disclosed special items that management believes are not representative of the Company's core business.  Management believes that excluding these special items enables them to make better period-over-period comparisons and benchmark the Company's operational performance against other companies in its industry more meaningfully.  Furthermore, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information that provides a more complete understanding of Company operating results and enables investors to analyze financial and business trends more thoroughly.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed in isolation, are not a substitute for GAAP measures and have limitations including, but not limited to, their usefulness as comparative measures as other companies may define their non-GAAP measures differently. 
   
  The following table presents a reconciliation of Operating income as reported to Adjusted operating income: 

Special items included in Operating income during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflect a loss on the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary.  Special items included in Operating income during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   represent rationalization charges related to employee severance and other related costs, charges related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, pension settlement charges and Venezuelan foreign exchange remeasurement losses related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism.

Special items included in Net income during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflect a loss on the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary and the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance as a result of a legal entity change.  Special items included in Net income during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   represent rationalization charges related to employee severance and other related costs, charges related to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, pension settlement charges and Venezuelan foreign exchange remeasurement losses related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The Company s cash flow from operations can be cyclical.  Operational cash flow is a key driver of liquidity, providing cash and access to capital markets.  In assessing liquidity, the Company reviews working capital measurements to define areas for improvement.  Management anticipates the Company will be able to satisfy cash requirements for its ongoing businesses for the foreseeable future primarily with cash generated by operations, existing cash balances, borrowings under its existing credit facilities and raising debt in capital markets. 
  The Company continues to expand globally and periodically looks at transactions that would involve significant investments.  The Company can fund its global expansion plans with operational cash flow, but a significant acquisition may require access to capital markets, in particular, the long-term debt market, as well as the syndicated bank loan market.  The Company s financing strategy is to fund itself at the lowest after-tax cost of funding.  Where possible, the Company utilizes operational cash flows and raises capital in the most efficient market, usually the United States, and then lends funds to the specific subsidiary that requires funding.  If additional acquisitions providing appropriate financial benefits become available, additional expenditures may be made. 
  The following table reflects changes in key cash flow measures:  

Cash and cash equivalents   decreased     15.5%   or   $47,255   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to   $256,928   from   $304,183   as of   December 31, 2015  .  This   decrease   was predominantly due to cash used in the acquisition of businesses, cash dividends paid to shareholders and the purchase of common shares for treasury, offset by cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from short-term borrowings.      The   decrease   in Cash and cash equivalents during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compares to an   increase   of   30.9%   or   $85,966   to   $364,345   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , $249,582 of Cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. 
  Cash provided by operating activities   increased   by   $1,330   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

Cash used by investing activities   increased   by   $38,316   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   was predominantly due to an increase in cash used in the acquisition of businesses.  The Company currently anticipates capital expenditures of $55,000 to $60,000 in   2016  .  Anticipated capital expenditures reflect investments for capital maintenance to improve operational effectiveness and the Company's continued international expansion.  Management critically evaluates all proposed capital expenditures and expects each project to increase efficiency, reduce costs, promote business growth, or improve the overall safety and environmental conditions of the Company s facilities. 
  Cash used by financing activities   increased   by   $124,648   to   $175,927   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   was due to proceeds from the 2015 Notes in the prior year, partially offset by proceeds from short-term borrowings in 2016.  On   October 20, 2016  , the Company issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of   $350,000   through a private placement.  All proceeds were received during October 2016 (see the Note 11 for additional information).  The Company's total weighted average effective interest rate and weighted average term, inclusive of the 2015 Notes and 2016 Notes, is   3.3%   and 18 years, respectively. 
  The Company anticipates share repurchases of approximately   $400,000   in   2016  .  
  The Company s total debt levels   increased   from   $354,625   at   December 31, 2015   to   $543,658   at   September 30, 2016  .  The increase was due to additional short-term borrowings.  Total debt to total invested capital increased to   41.9%   at   September 30, 2016   from   27.6%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  In October 2016, the Company paid a cash dividend of   $0.32   per share, or   $21,129   to shareholders of record on September 30, 2016.  
  Working Capital Ratios

Return on Invested Capital 
  The Company reviews return on invested capital ("ROIC") in assessing and evaluating the Company's underlying operating performance.  ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC.  ROIC is defined as rolling 12 months of Adjusted net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital.  Invested capital is defined as total debt, which includes Short-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portions, plus Total equity. 
  ROIC for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:

Venezuela   Deconsolidation 
  Effective June 30, 2016, the Company determined that deteriorating conditions in Venezuela had led the Company to no longer meet the accounting criteria for control over its Venezuelan subsidiary.  The restrictive exchange controls in Venezuela and the lack of access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuela bolivar and the U.S. dollar, and restricted the Venezuela operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.  Additionally, other operating restrictions including government controls on pricing, profits, imports and restrictive labor laws significantly impacted the Company s ability to make key operational decisions, including the ability to manage its capital structure, purchasing, product pricing and labor relations.  Therefore, as of June 30, 2016, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of its subsidiary in Venezuela and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting. 
  As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recorded a pretax charge of   $34,348   (  $33,251   after-tax) in the second quarter of 2016.  The pretax charge includes the write-off of the Company s investment in Venezuela, including all inter-company balances and   $283   of Cash and cash equivalents.  Additionally, the charge includes foreign currency translation losses and pension losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  Beginning July 1, 2016, the Company no longer includes the results of the Venezuelan subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements.  Under the cost method of accounting, if cash were to be received from the Venezuela entity in future periods from the sale of inventory, dividends or royalties, income would be recognized.  The Company does not anticipate dividend or royalty payments being made in the foreseeable future and has had no purchases from or sales to the Venezuela entity since it was deconsolidated. The factors that led to the Company s conclusion to deconsolidate at June 30, 2016 continued to exist through September 30, 2016.  The Company expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.  
  Prior to deconsolidation, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company s Venezuela operations contributed   $34,689   to Net sales, a $16,841 loss to Gross profit and net losses of $26,316, or a loss of $0.36 per diluted share.  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company s Venezuela operations contributed   $80,919   to Net sales, a $5,258 loss to Gross profit and net losses of $23,130, or a loss of $0.30 per diluted share. The losses in Gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, include a $22,172 lower of cost or market inventory adjustment related to the adoption of a new foreign exchange mechanism.  Adjusted net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, included earnings of $3,376, or $0.05 per diluted share from the Venezuela operations.

  Pensions 
  In October 2016, the Company announced an amendment to The Lincoln Electric Company Retirement Annuity Program ( RAP ) to cease all benefit accruals for participants under the RAP effective as of December 31, 2016.  The RAP currently includes approximately 1,500 domestic employees who will fully transition to The Lincoln Electric Company Employee Savings Plan ( Savings Plan ), a defined contribution retirement savings plan.  Additionally, in October 2016, the Company announced an amendment to the Savings Plan to allow eligible employees to receive company contributions through a combination of matching and automatic employer contributions. These changes will not have a material impact on 2016 or 2017 financial statements.

Exhibit 31.1 
  CERTIFICATION 
  I, Christopher L. Mapes, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c)

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5.
