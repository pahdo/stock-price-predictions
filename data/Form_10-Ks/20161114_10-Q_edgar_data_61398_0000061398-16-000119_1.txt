NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

N  ote 1 - Basis of Presentation    
  Description of Operations 
  Magellan Petroleum Corporation (the "Company" or "Magellan" or "MPC" or "we") is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Subject to the closing of the announced merger with Tellurian Investments Inc. ( Tellurian ), Magellan will become a company focused on the development of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) projects along the United States Gulf Coast and complementary business lines in the energy industry. Historically active internationally, Magellan also owns interests in the Horse Hill-1 well and related licenses in the Weald Basin, onshore UK, and an exploration block, NT/P82, in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia. 
  The Company conducts its operations through   two   wholly owned subsidiaries corresponding to the geographical areas in which the Company operates: Magellan Petroleum (UK) Limited ("MPUK"), and Magellan Petroleum Australia Pty Ltd ("MPA"). Following the closing of the merger with Tellurian, which is expected in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 or the first quarter of calendar year 2017, the combined company will operate its LNG business in the US through its new wholly owned subsidiary, Tellurian.  
  We believe that Magellan s sources of value are embedded in the Company s platform and portfolio of assets. Magellan s strategy is therefore focused on recovering shareholder value by realizing the value of its existing assets. 
  On July 10, 2015, the Company completed a one share-for-eight shares reverse stock split with respect to the Company's common stock. All amounts of shares of common stock, per share prices with respect to common stock, amounts of stock options to purchase common stock, respective exercise prices of each such option, and amounts of shares convertible upon conversion of the Series A convertible preferred stock for periods both prior and subsequent to the split have been adjusted in this report to reflect the reverse stock split. 
  We were founded in 1957 and incorporated in Delaware in 1967.  The Company's common stock has been trading on NASDAQ since 1972 under the ticker symbol "MPET".  
  Our principal executive offices are located at 1775 Sherman Street, Suite 1950, Denver, Colorado 80203, and our phone number is (720) 484-2400.  
  Going Concern 
  The Company has incurred losses from operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $2.2 million  , has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations of   $1.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and as of   September 30, 2016  , its cash balance was   $892 thousand  . The Company continues to experience liquidity constraints and since July 2015,  has been selling certain of its assets to fund its operations, which has resulted in a significant reduction in the Company s monthly cash burn rate. However, these liquidity constraints continue, and proceeds from these asset sales may not provide sufficient liquidity to fund the Company's operations for the next twelve months. As a result of these conditions and events, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Because Tellurian s assets do not currently generate revenues, the combined company is also likely to experience liquidity constraints. However, we believe that upon the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the combined company will be better positioned     to raise capital to fund the combined company's operations due to the attributes of Tellurian's business plan and management. Therefore, we believe that Magellan's ability to continue as a going concern in the short-term is subject to the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the primary condition of which closing is the approval by the Company s shareholders of the merger agreement that is expected to be sought in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016, or the first quarter of calendar year 2017. However, following the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the combined company may not be able to raise sufficient capital in a timely manner to fund the operations of the combined company. Should the merger with Tellurian not close, the Company will need to pursue other alternatives in order to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   
  Special Committee of the Board of Directors 
  In light of the Company's constrained capital resources and the significant capital requirements to develop the Poplar field using CO   2   -Enhanced Oil Recovery ("EOR"), on June 5, 2015, the Company formed a special committee of independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Special Committee") to i) consider various strategic alternatives potentially available to the Company, which included, but were not limited to, sales of some or all of the assets of the Company,  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

joint ventures, a recapitalization, and a sale or merger of the Company and ii) amend compensation arrangements of executives and employees for the purpose of retention and alignment of their interests with the interests of common stockholders during such strategic alternatives review process. The Special Committee engaged Petrie Partners, LLC ("Petrie") as financial advisor to assist in the consideration of such matters.  
  As discussed in Note 2 - Merger with Tellurian, on August 2, 2016, at the direction of the Special Committee, Magellan entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Tellurian and River Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan ( Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock, par value   $0.001   per share, of Tellurian will be exchanged for   1.300   shares of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of Magellan, and Merger Sub will merge with and into Tellurian (the  Merger ), with Tellurian continuing as the surviving corporation, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan, and the accounting acquirer.  
  As discussed in Note 3 - One Stone Exchange, and Note 5 - Discontinued Operations, on March 31, 2016, at the direction of the Special Committee, the Company and its sole preferred stockholder One Stone Holdings II LP ("One Stone"), an affiliate of One Stone Energy Partners, L.P., entered into an Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") pursuant to which   100%   of the outstanding shares of Magellan Series A convertible preferred stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") were exchanged in consideration for   100%   of the Company's interest in Nautilus Poplar LLC and   51%   of the outstanding common units in Utah CO2 LLC ( Utah CO2,  and together with Nautilus Poplar LLC, the "CO2 Business", or "NP", or the "former NP segment"), as adjusted by the Cash Amount (as defined in the Exchange Agreement and discussed further below) (the  Exchange ). On August 1, 2016, all the conditions to the closing of the Exchange were met and the Exchange was consummated.  
  As discussed in Note 4 - Sale of Weald Basin Assets, and Note 5 - Discontinued Operations, on June 10, 2016, at the direction of the Special Committee, MPUK entered into three concurrent agreements (the "Weald Agreements") for divestiture of certain of its Petroleum Exploration and Development Licenses ("PEDLs"), its peripheral offshore license near the Isle of Wight, and settlement of legal claims related to the Central Weald licenses with its partner and operator, Celtique Energie Weald Limited ("Celtique"). On August 11, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Weald Agreements closed. 
  Following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement with One Stone, and the subsequently announced Merger with Tellurian, the Company believes that the task of the Special Committee has substantially been completed, and on September 26, 2016, the Board disbanded the Special Committee.  
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Magellan and its wholly owned subsidiaries, MPUK, and MPA, and for periods through closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement on August 1, 2016, NP (which has been discontinued and was transferred to One Stone upon closing), and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete annual period financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Operating results for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   June 30, 2017  . This report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016   (the "  2016   Form 10-K"). All amounts presented are in US dollars, unless otherwise noted. Amounts expressed in Australian currency are indicated as "A$." Amounts expressed in the currency of the United Kingdom are indicated as " ." 
  Certain amounts in our prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Effective with the execution of the Exchange Agreement on March 31, 2016, the Company reclassified the operations of NP to discontinued operations, and they are reported in discontinued operations for the period from July 1, 2016 through closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement on August 1, 2016 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, and for all prior periods presented. The Company also reclassified assets and liabilities of NP to assets and liabilities held for sale for all periods prior to closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Effective with the execution of the Weald Agreements on June 10, 2016, the Company reclassified the operations related to the respective licenses to discontinued operations, and they are reported in discontinued operations for the period from July 1, 2016 through closing of the transactions contemplated by the Weald Agreements on August 11, 2016 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, and for all prior periods presented. The Company also reclassified assets and  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

liabilities related to the respective licenses to assets and liabilities held for sale for all periods prior to closing of the transactions contemplated by the Weald Agreements in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned a   1.9%   interest in Central Petroleum Limited (ASX:CTP) ("Central"), a Brisbane-based exploration and production company traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The Company accounts for this investment as securities available-for-sale in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned a   2.0%   interest in UK Oil and Gas Investments, PLC (LSE:UKOG) ("UKOG"), a British oil and gas investment company traded on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company accounts for this investment as securities available-for-sale in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Accounting for Business Combinations 
  At the closing of the Merger, Tellurian, the accounting acquirer will account for the Merger with Magellan as a purchase.  At the closing of the Merger, the adjustments to the consolidated financial statements and the allocation of the purchase price will depend on a number of factors including the fair value of Magellan's common stock transfered and the estimated fair value of Magellan's assets and liabilities at the closing date.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of oil and gas reserves and other assets and liabilities, together with disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to US dollars at period-end exchange rates, and our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. A component of accumulated other comprehensive income will be released into income when the Company executes a partial or complete sale of an investment in a foreign subsidiary or a group of assets of a foreign subsidiary considered a business and/or when the Company no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a foreign subsidiary or group of assets of a foreign subsidiary considered a business. 
  Transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses that are reflected in results of operations as unrealized (based on period end translation) or realized (upon settlement of the transactions) and reported under general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the Company made a determination that it was no longer permanently invested in its foreign subsidiaries because (i) the Company had begun an effort to repay its intercompany balances through the repatriation of cash from these subsidiaries and (ii) the Company was increasingly focusing on its US operations. As such, the Company recorded on its statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, an expense reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss arising from foreign currency exchange losses on its intercompany account balances. For all subsequent periods, including the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company has continued to record foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from its intercompany account balances in its condensed consolidated statement of operations.  
  Securities Available-for-Sale 
  Securities available-for-sale are comprised of investments in publicly traded securities and are carried at quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity (deficit), net of deferred income taxes. The Company recognizes gains or losses when securities are sold. On a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with an unrealized loss has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment. The Company performed this analysis as of   September 30, 2016  , and concluded that no such events had occurred.  
   Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale 
  As a result of the Exchange Agreement executed on March 31, 2016 (see Note 3 - One Stone Exchange), the Company determined that a strategic shift occurred in its business that will have a major effect on the Company's future operations and financial results. Therefore, the Company adjusted the assets and liabilities of NP to the lesser of their carrying value or fair

value less costs to sell, which resulted in an impairment writedown of   $11.3 million  , and reclassified them as held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets effective March 31, 2016, and for all prior periods presented. The Company also reclassified the results of NP's operations to discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. In addition, on June 10, 2016, the Company entered into the Weald Agreements (see Note 4 - Sale of Weald Basin Assets). The Company determined that no fair value adjustments of the assets and liabilities disposed of pursuant to the Weald Agreements was necessary because the net assets were recorded at less than their fair value less costs to sell. The major classes of assets and liabilities transferred in the Exchange and sold pursuant to the Weald Agreements as well as the results of these discontinued operations are presented in Note 5 - Discontinued Operations. The closing of the Exchange took place on August 1, 2016, following its approval at the Company's annual and special meeting of stockholders on July 13, 2016. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Weald Agreements took place on August 11, 2016.  
  Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities 
  The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, all property acquisition costs, and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized until a determination is made that the well has found proved reserves or is deemed noncommercial. If an exploratory well is deemed to be noncommercial, the well costs are charged to exploration expense as dry hole costs. Exploration expenses include dry hole costs and geological and geophysical expenses. Noncommercial development well costs are charged to impairment expense if circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of the carrying value may have occurred. 
  The Company records its proportionate share in joint venture operations in the respective classifications of assets, liabilities, and expenses. The cost of CO   2    injection is capitalized until a production response is seen as a result of the injection and it is determined that the well has found proved reserves. After oil production from the well begins, CO   2    injection costs are expensed as incurred.   
  Depreciation, depletion, and amortization ("DD A") of capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties is calculated on a property-by-property basis using the units-of-production method based upon proved reserves. The computation of DD A takes into consideration restoration, dismantlement, and abandonment costs as well as the estimated proceeds from salvaging equipment. Because all of the Company's proved oil and gas properties related to NP, DD A has been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Effective with the classification of the assets and liabilities of NP to held for sale on March 31, 2016, including the proved oil and gas properties, the Company halted DD A related to these assets, and no further DD A has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from April 1, 2016 through their disposition in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement on August 1, 2016. 
  The sale of a partial interest in a proved oil and gas property is accounted for as normal retirement, and no gain or loss is recognized as long as the treatment does not significantly affect the units-of-production depletion rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties. The sale of a partial interest in an unproved oil and gas property is accounted for as a recovery of cost, with any excess of the proceeds over such cost or related carrying amount recognized as gain. 
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
  The Company reviews the carrying amount of its oil and gas properties and unproved leaseholds for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. The Company estimates the expected undiscounted future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of estimated future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs, using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. There were no significant changes in circumstances during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that would indicate that the carrying values of oil and gas properties were further impaired.  
  Goodwill    
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of liabilities assumed in an acquisition. The goodwill recorded as of   September 30, 2016   relates to the Company's foreign subsidiaries. GAAP requires goodwill to be evaluated on an annual basis for impairment, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could potentially result in impairment. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no significant changes in events or circumstances that suggested further potential impairment of the Company's goodwill balances at   September 30, 2016  .

Asset Retirement Obligations 
  The Company recognizes an estimated liability for future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of its oil and gas properties. A liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation and corresponding increase in the carrying value of the related long-lived asset are recorded at the time a well is acquired or the liability to plug is legally incurred. Assumptions and judgments made by management when assessing an asset retirement obligation include (i) the existence of a legal obligation; (ii) estimated probabilities, amounts, and timing of settlements; (iii) the credit-adjusted risk-free rate to be used; and (iv) inflation rates. The Company depletes the amount added to proved oil and gas property costs, net of estimated salvage values, and recognizes expense in connection with the accretion of the discounted liability over the remaining estimated economic lives of the respective oil and gas properties. The Company's asset retirement obligations were classified as held for sale as of   June 30, 2016   in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, as they relate to NP, and the effects of changes therein have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  Stock option grants may contain time-based, market-based, or performance-based vesting provisions. Time-based options ("TBOs") are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Market-based options ("MBOs") are expensed on a straight-line basis over the derived service period, even if the market condition is not achieved. Performance-based options ("PBOs") are amortized on a straight-line basis between the date upon which the achievement of the relevant performance condition is deemed probable and the date the performance condition is expected to be achieved. Management re-assesses whether achievement of performance conditions is probable at the end of each reporting period. If changes in the estimated outcome of the performance conditions affect the quantity of the awards expected to vest, the cumulative effect of the change is recognized in the period of the change. 
  The fair value of the stock options is determined on the grant date and is affected by our stock price and other assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends, and the expected option exercise term. The Company estimates the fair value of PBOs and time-based stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The simplified method is used to estimate the expected term of stock options due to a lack of related historical data regarding exercise, cancellation, and forfeiture. For MBOs, the fair value is estimated using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
  Other comprehensive income (loss) is presented net of applicable income taxes in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of stockholders' equity (deficit) and comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that under GAAP are reported as separate components of stockholders' equity (deficit) instead of net loss. 
  Earnings (Loss) per Common Share 
  Income and losses per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. The effects of potentially dilutive securities in the determination of diluted earnings per share are the dilutive effect of stock options and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock.  
  The potentially dilutive impact of stock options is determined using the treasury stock method. The potentially dilutive impact of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock is determined using the if-converted method. In applying the if-converted method, conversion is not assumed for purposes of computing dilutive shares if the effect would be anti-dilutive. Until its redemption upon closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement on August 1, 2016, the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible at a rate of   one   common share for one preferred share, multiplied by an applicable conversion ratio. We did not include any stock options nor common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for each of the   three  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to net losses in those periods. 
  Segment Information 
  As of   June 30, 2016  , the Company determined, based on the criteria of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, that it operated in   two   segments, MPUK, and MPA, as well as a head office, Magellan ("Corporate"), which is treated as a cost center. As of   September 30, 2016  , these   two   operating segments met the minimum quantitative threshold to qualify for separate segment reporting.  
  The Company's chief operating decision maker is Antoine J. Lafargue (President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Corporate Secretary of the Company), who reviews the results and manages operations of the Company in the   two   reporting segments of MPUK, and MPA, as well as Corporate. The presentation of all segment information herein reflects the manner in which the Company's management monitors performance and allocates resources. For

  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in reporting certain items in the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for the Company for its first interim period in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, which is intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; (c) classification on the statement of cash flows; and (d) accounting for forfeitures. This standard will be effective for the Company for its first interim period in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months, and provides revised guidance on lease classification as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations or comprehensive loss, and the pattern of cash flow classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for the Company for its first interim period in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This standard will be effective for the Company for its first interim period in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, with earlier application not permitted with the exception of certain specific provisions. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes in the classified balance sheet, by removing the requirement to separate current and noncurrent deferred taxes and requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent. This standard will be effective for the Company for its first interim period in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2015-17 to have a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, which simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date in a business combination, by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs. This standard is effective for the Company for its first interim period in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The Company has adopted this standard, which has not had a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company expects to account for such adjustments, if any, on a prospective basis.  
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, which provides guidance on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This standard is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, and annual and interim periods thereafter. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-8, which changed the requirements for reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. ASU 2014-8 is effective for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. The Company has adopted this standard and applied its guidance to its reporting and disclosure of the One Stone Exchange, the Weald ATA and the IoW ATA, and discontinued operations of NP and MPUK. (Notes 3, 4 and 5). 
  There are no new significant accounting standards applicable to the Company that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company as of   September 30, 2016  .

Note 2 - Merger with Tellurian 
  On August 2, 2016, Magellan, Tellurian, and Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock, par value   $0.001   per share, of Tellurian will be exchanged for   1.300   shares of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of Magellan, and Merger Sub will merge with and into Tellurian, with Tellurian continuing as the surviving corporation, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan, and the accounting acquirer. The Merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 or the first quarter of calendar year 2017. 
  The Merger Agreement and the Merger have been approved by the board of directors of each of Magellan and Tellurian. Stockholders of Magellan will be asked to vote on the approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement at a special meeting that is expected to be held during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 or the first quarter of calendar year 2017. The closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including i) the receipt of Magellan and Tellurian stockholder approval; ii) all directors and officers of Magellan shall have resigned, except for any person(s) that might be designated by Tellurian; iii) a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the Magellan shares to be issued in the Merger shall have been declared effective by the SEC; and iv) shares of Magellan common stock to be issued in the Merger shall have been approved for listing on the NASDAQ.  
  The Merger Agreement also contains a non-solicitation provision pursuant to which Magellan may not, directly or indirectly, take certain actions to negotiate or otherwise facilitate an  Alternative Proposal,  a term generally defined as an inquiry, proposal or offer relating to a business combination with or acquisition of the assets of Magellan by a person or entity other than Tellurian. Magellan s non-solicitation obligations are qualified by  fiduciary out  provisions which provide that Magellan may take certain otherwise prohibited actions with respect to an unsolicited Alternative Proposal if the Board of Directors determines that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and certain other requirements are satisfied.  
  The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including in specified circumstances in connection with receipt of a "Superior Proposal," as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement. In connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement in the event of a Superior Proposal, a breach by Magellan of the non-solicitation provision noted above, or following a change by the Board of Directors of its recommendation to stockholders, Magellan will be required to pay to Tellurian a termination fee for any and all third-party transaction fees and expenses incurred by Tellurian with the drafting, negotiation, execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and related documents (including fees and expenses for attorneys, accountants and other advisors), subject to a maximum of   $1 million   in the aggregate. A termination fee may also be payable in some circumstances in which an Alternative Proposal is made, the transaction fails to close and Magellan subsequently agrees to an Alternative Proposal. If the Merger Agreement is terminated by either party as a result of the failure to obtain the requisite approval by Tellurian stockholders, or by Magellan because Tellurian does not use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the approval for listing the Magellan shares of common stock to be issued in the Merger, then Tellurian will be required to pay to Magellan a reverse termination fee of   $1 million  . 
  In connection with and following the consummation of the Merger, certain contingent items of Magellan will become due and payable by the combined company, including (i) transaction fees payable in shares of Magellan common stock to Petrie; (ii) compensation payable in a combination of cash and Magellan common stock to members of the Special Committee; (iii) transaction incentive compensation payable in cash and common stock to Magellan's Chief Executive Officer, including release of prior transaction incentive compensation; (iv) employee cash bonuses payable under the employee retention cash bonus plan; and (v) the release of Magellan's contingent production obligations related to the Poplar field, via issuance of shares of Magellan common stock     to the beneficiaries of such contingent obligations. In addition, the accelerated vesting provisions of the Company's remaining unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock are expected to be triggered, and these options and restricted stock are expected to become fully vested. In addition, upon the closing of the Merger, which constitutes a change in control, there is a risk that most of the Company's tax attributes may not be available to the Company to reduce the Company's potential US federal and state income taxes. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had foreign tax credit carry forwards amounting to   $9.1 million  , which, based on the Company s estimated tax rate as of June 30, 2016, have the potential to offset approximately   $26.8 million   of taxable income. For further information on these contingent items, refer to   Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies  ,     Note 19 - Employee Retention and Severance Costs     and     Note 10 - Income Taxes  . 

Note 3 - One Stone Exchange    
  On March 31, 2016, Magellan and One Stone entered into the Exchange Agreement. The Exchange Agreement provides, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, for the transfer by One Stone to the Company of   100%   of the outstanding shares of Magellan Series A Preferred Stock, in consideration for the assignment to and  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

assumption by One Stone of   100%   of the outstanding membership interests in Nautilus Poplar LLC, and   51%   of the outstanding common units in Utah CO2 LLC, as adjusted by the Cash Amount (as defined in the Exchange Agreement and discussed further below).  
  On August 1, 2016, all the conditions to the closing of the Exchange were met and the Exchange was consummated. The primary conditions to closing included i) the receipt of the approval of the Exchange by the Company's stockholders, which was received on July 13, 2016, during the Company's annual and special meeting of stockholders, ii) the consent of West Texas State Bank ("WTSB") to release a guaranty provided by Magellan, and iii) the payment of the Cash Amount. If the customary closing conditions had not been satisfied, and the Exchange Agreement had been terminated by either party as a result of the failure to obtain the requisite approval by Magellan stockholders, the Company would have been required to reimburse One Stone for all documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by One Stone in connection with the Exchange Agreement, subject to a maximum of   $200 thousand   in the aggregate. On August 1, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement closed and the Company received the Cash Amount, which amounted to   $900 thousand  . The Company recorded the excess of the proceeds, such proceeds consisting of (i) the carrying amount of the preferred stock; plus (ii) the Cash Amount; plus (iii) the principal amount of the secured promissory note, over the fair value of the net assets of the CO2 Business as a contribution to equity from One Stone, resulting in an increase to capital in excess of par value of approximately   $9.9 million   (Note 5). Transaction costs associated with the Exchange Agreement were charged to expense and recorded in discontinued operations and amounted to approximately   $968 thousand   in the aggregate. 
  The Exchange Agreement was given economic effect as of September 30, 2015 (the  Effective Date ). As such, at closing, One Stone was expected to pay the Company an amount in cash equal to i) any transaction costs One Stone had agreed to pay pursuant to the Exchange Agreement that had not been paid on or prior to closing, ii) minus (if positive) or plus (if negative) the net revenues and expenses attributable to NP after the Effective Date, plus iii) certain specified liabilities of NP actually paid by the Company or NP prior to closing, minus, (iv) the Loan Amount (the  Cash Amount ). The purpose of the Cash Amount was primarily to reimburse the Company for the funding of the operations of NP during the period between September 30, 2015, and the closing of the Exchange, which operations resulted in a loss in the aggregate for the period. At the end of June 2016, the Company provided One Stone with a preliminary estimate of the Cash Amount, which amounted to   $1.2 million  . On August 1, 2016, the final amount agreed between the parties and paid by One Stone to the Company was   $900 thousand  . In addition, Messrs. Israel and Gluzman, One Stone's representatives on the Company's Board of Directors, i) agreed to forgo the amount of director compensation, in cash and stock, owed to them and outstanding as of the closing date, which was estimated at approximately   $174 thousand   in the aggregate and ii) ceased serving as members of the Board effective as of August 1, 2016.  
  Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on April 15, 2016, Magellan and One Stone i) entered into a Secured Promissory Note (the  Note ) pursuant to which One Stone made a loan to Magellan in the aggregate amount of   $625 thousand   (the  Loan Amount ) and ii) simultaneously entered into a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which Magellan pledged, assigned and granted to One Stone a security interest in the Company s interests in MPA, as collateral for the loan. The purpose of the Note was primarily to fund the payment of outstanding payables with certain vendors of the CO2 Business to maintain its ongoing operations between signing of the Exchange Agreement and closing of the Exchange. The Note did not bear interest up until closing of the Exchange, was expected to be forgiven upon closing of the Exchange, and if the Exchange had not closed, would have become due and payable on August 1, 2016, or, in the case of a breach of the Exchange Agreement by One Stone, on August 1, 2017, and would have borne interest from the date of termination of the Exchange Agreement at a rate of the prime rate of interest plus   1%   (  4.5%   at August 1, 2016). Upon closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016, the Loan Amount was deemed paid in full and no further amounts under the Note were owed by the Company. Also, One Stone assumed all assets and virtually all liabilities related to the CO2 Business, which included a term loan with WTSB and outstanding accounts payable related to the CO2 Business. 
  The Exchange Agreement may have been terminated under certain circumstances, including in specified circumstances in connection with receipt of a Superior Proposal, as such term is defined in the Exchange Agreement. In connection with a termination of the Exchange Agreement in the event of a Superior Proposal, a breach by the Company of the non-solicitation provision, or following a change by the Board of its recommendation to stockholders, in addition to amounts discussed above, the Company would have been required to pay to One Stone a termination fee of   $750 thousand  .  
  In addition, since the Exchange constituted a disposition of substantially all of the Company's US assets, the acceleration provisions of the grants of performance-based and market-based options made in October 2013 and October 2014 took effect, and these options became fully vested as of the closing of the Exchange. The remaining unamortized expense related to these grants as of the closing date was expensed, which expense amounted to approximately   $369 thousand  , including release of forfeitures. Following the closing of the Exchange, the Company canceled all issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including PIK dividends owing for the period between June 30, 2016 and August 1, 2016, which amounted to   22,815,748   shares, and eliminated its preferred stock (Note 12).

Note 4 - Sale of Weald Basin Assets 
  On June 10, 2016, MPUK entered into three concurrent agreements, the Weald Agreements, which resulted in the disposal of its interests in four licenses in the UK and the settlement of all legal claims related to its dispute with Celtique.  
  On June 10, 2016, MPUK entered into i) an Asset Transfer Agreement relating to the sale to UK Oil   Gas Investments PLC ("UKOG") of MPUK's   50%   interests in PEDLs 231, 234, and 243 (the "Weald ATA"), ii) an Asset Transfer Agreement relating to the sale to UKOG of MPUK's   22.5%   interest in the Offshore Petroleum Licence P1916 (the "IoW ATA"), and iii) a Settlement Agreement (as defined below) with Celtique. The consideration payable by UKOG to MPUK for the Weald ATA amounted to    1.8 million   in a combination of cash and shares in UKOG. The number and value of shares of UKOG was determined as of the time of execution of the Weald ATA and was based on the volume weighted average price of an ordinary share of UKOG for the ten business days prior to June 10, 2016. The consideration for the IoW ATA was the assumption of MPUK's outstanding payables of    16 thousand   related to its interests in the Offshore Petroleum Licence P1916. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, MPUK was due to pay Celtique    500 thousand   of the gross consideration, in a combination of cash and shares in UKOG pro rata to the consideration payable to MPUK for the Weald ATA.  
  The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA was subject to customary conditions and the approval by the UK Oil and Gas Authority of, amongst other things, an extension of the term of PEDL 234. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA, IoW ATA, and Settlement Agreement were conditional upon each other and also subject to the completion of the acquisition by UKOG of the entire issued share capital in Celtique, the terms of which acquisition were based on consideration equivalent to that in the Weald ATA. Contemporaneously with these transactions, MPUK and Celtique initiated the process of relinquishing their interests in PEDLs 231 and 243. 
  With respect to the Settlement Agreement, MPUK entered into a settlement agreement with Celtique and its parent Celtique Energie Petroleum Limited (the "Settlement Agreement") which provided for the dismissal of all claims and counterclaims related to PEDLs 231, 234, and 243 between the parties. The Settlement Agreement also included a standstill provision among all parties until the completion of the Weald ATA. 
  On August 11, 2016, the conditions to closing the transactions contemplated by the Weald Agreements were met, and the transactions contemplated by all three agreements closed, with MPUK receiving net cash proceeds of    446 thousand   and the net issuance to MPUK of approximately   50.9 million   shares of UKOG, which shares were worth approximately    713 thousand     and    930 thousand   as of August 11, 2016, and   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Upon closing the transactions contemplated by the Weald Agreements during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax, of    $1.1 million   (Note 5). 
  In connection with the Weald ATA, IoW ATA, and Settlement Agreement, the Company accrued its liabilities to Celtique to the full amount of the consideration payable to Celtique of    500 thousand   as of   June 30, 2016  , and classified its assets and liabilities related to PEDLs 231, 234, and 243, and P1916 to held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of   June 30, 2016  . The Company also classified the operations related to these licenses for the period from July 1, 2016 to closing on August 11, 2016, and for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , to discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For further information, refer to   Note 5 - Discontinued Operations  .  

Note 5 - Discontinued Operations    
  As discussed in detail in Note 3, on August 1, 2016, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company completed the Exchange of   100%   of its interest in the CO2 Business for the redemption of   100%   of its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, as adjusted by the Cash Amount. The assets and liabilities of the CO2 Business constituted and were previously reported under the Company's former NP segment, and, following the Company's determination that the closing of the Exchange was probable, were recorded at their fair values, less the cost to sell, and were classified as held for sale as of   June 30, 2016   in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Similarly, the results of operations of the CO2 Business have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.  
  In addition, as discussed in detail in Note 4, on August 11, 2016, pursuant to the Weald Agreements, the Company completed the disposal of its interests in four licenses in the UK and the settlement of all legal claims related to its dispute with Celtique. The assets and liabilities related to the Weald Agreements were previously reported under the Company's MPUK segment, and were recorded at their fair values, less the cost to sell, and were classified as held for sale as of   June 30, 2016   in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Similarly, the results of operations related to these licenses have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.

Following is a reconciliation of the major classes of line items constituting the pretax income (loss) from discontinued operations to the after-tax income (loss) from discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company recorded estimated transaction costs related to the Exchange of   $690 thousand   in loss from discontinued operations. Cumulative transaction costs related to the Exchange incurred through   September 30, 2016   were   $968 thousand  . The additional transaction costs of    $278 thousand   are included in loss from discontinued operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Included in assets held for sale at   June 30, 2016   were cash balances related to the CO2 Business of   $141 thousand  . At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, as a result of the settlement of the Cash Amount, the Company retained the cash of the CO2 Business and transferred to the CO2 Business a cash collateral account of   $150 thousand   securing certain surety bonds of Poplar.

  Contingent Production Payments 
  T  he Company has retained potential future contingent production payments related to its September 2011 acquisition of NP. The contingent production payments are payable, up to a total of   $5.0 million  , if certain increased average daily production rates are achieved at the Poplar field. Based upon the latest reserves estimates available to the Company, the contingent production payments are unlikely to be paid, and therefore, are not recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, on September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with the beneficiaries of these contingent production payments to dispose of its obligations related to them. See   Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies      for further information. 

Note 6 - Sale of Amadeus Basin Assets  
  On March 31, 2014 (the "Central Closing Date"), pursuant to the Share Sale and Purchase Deed dated February 17, 2014 (the "Sale Deed"), the Company sold its Amadeus Basin assets, the Palm Valley and Dingo gas fields ("Palm Valley" and "Dingo," respectively), to Central through the sale of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Magellan Petroleum (N.T.) Pty. Ltd ("MPNT"), to Central's wholly owned subsidiary, Central Petroleum PV Pty. Ltd ("Central PV"). In exchange for the assets, Central paid to Magellan (i)   A$20 million  , (ii) customary purchase price adjustments amounting to   A$800 thousand  ; and (iii)   39.5 million   newly issued shares of Central stock (ASX: CTP), equivalent to an ownership interest in Central of approximately   11%  .

     Table of Contents  

The Sale Deed also provides that the Company is entitled to receive   25%   of the revenues generated at the Palm Valley gas field from gas sales when the volume-weighted gas price realized at Palm Valley exceeds   A$5.00  /Gigajoule and   A$6.00  /Gigajoule for the first   10 years   following the Central Closing Date and for the following   five years  , respectively, with such prices to be escalated in accordance with the Australian consumer price index. Between the third and fifth anniversaries of the Central Closing Date, inclusive, the Company may seek from Central a one-time payment (the "Bonus Discharge Amount") corresponding to the present value, assuming an annual discount rate of   10%  , of any expected remaining bonus payments in exchange for forgoing future bonus payments. If the Company receives the Bonus Discharge Amount, bonus payments and the Bonus Discharge Amount together may not exceed   A$7 million  . 
  The Company also retained its rights to receive any and all bonuses (the "Mereenie Bonus") payable by Santos Ltd ("Santos") and contingent upon production at the Mereenie oil and gas field achieving certain threshold levels. The Mereenie Bonus was established in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to the terms of the asset swap agreement between the Company and Santos for the sale of the Company's interest in Mereenie to Santos and the Company's purchase of the interests of Santos in the Palm Valley and Dingo gas fields. The Company has historically not recognized a contingent asset related to the Bonus Discharge Amount or Mereenie Bonus, as such amounts are not reasonably assured.  
  On May 18, 2016, pursuant to a sale and purchase deed and deed of consent, with appropriate consent from Santos, the Company sold its rights in the Mereenie Bonus for   A$3.5 million  , which translated to   $2.5 million   on that date. Since no asset had previously been recorded related to the Mereenie Bonus, the Company recorded the entire sales price as a gain for the year ended   June 30, 2016  .   The Company s ability to repatriate the proceeds from the sale of the Mereenie Bonus to the US was constrained by the terms of the Pledge Agreement the Company entered into in conjunction with the Note with One Stone, until closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016.  

Note 7 - Securities Available-for-Sale  
  The following table presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair market value of available-for-sale equity securities: 

On August 11, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Weald Agreements and upon closing of the transactions contemplated thereby, the Company received approximately   50.9 million   shares of UKOG common stock (AIM:UKOG) as partial consideration pursuant to the Weald ATA. The Company considers the shares of UKOG to be available-for-sale, and therefore records temporary fluctuations in the value of such shares in other comprehensive income (loss). Pursuant to the Weald ATA, the Company's shares in UKOG are subject to a six-month lock-up period on transfer, and the Company therefore may not sell its shares until February 10, 2017.  
  On April 15, 2016, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Magellan and One Stone entered into a Secured Promissory Note pursuant to which One Stone made a loan to Magellan in the aggregate amount of   $625 thousand   and simultaneously entered into a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which Magellan pledged, assigned and granted to One Stone a security interest in Magellan's interests in MPA, which in turn holds the Company's shareholdings of Central common stock, as collateral for the Note. Upon the closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016, the Loan Amount was deemed paid in full and the Pledge Agreement was terminated, which restored the ability of the Company to sell its shares of Central common stock.  
  As of June 30, 2015, the Company determined that unrealized losses related to its investment in Central were other-than-temporary, and recognized an impairment loss in the amount of   $14.9 million   for the year ended June 30, 2015, equal to the difference between the carrying value of its investment in Central and the market price of Central's common stock on the

Australian Securities Exchange at June 30, 2015, including applicable foreign currency translation. The Company continues to monitor its investments in available-for-sale securities for indicators of other than temporary impairment. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that no such impairment had occurred.  

Note 8 - Notes Payable    
  Insurance Premium Notes    
  Between January 2016 and September 2016, the Company entered into three separate insurance premium financing agreements (the "Premium Notes") to finance the insurance premiums related to the annual renewal of the Company's insurance policies. The Premium Notes have an aggregate original principal amount of   $262 thousand  , bear interest ranging between   6.25%   and   7.75%  , and have amortization terms ranging from   eight   to   ten   months. The aggregate principal and interest payments due monthly under the Premium Notes range between   $27 thousand   and   $2 thousand  , and are payable between   October 2016   and   May 2017  . 
  Secured Promissory Note    
  Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on April 15, 2016, Magellan and One Stone i) entered into a Secured Promissory Note (the  Note ) pursuant to which One Stone made a loan to Magellan in the aggregate amount of   $625 thousand   (the  Loan Amount ) and ii) simultaneously entered into a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which Magellan pledged, assigned and granted to One Stone a security interest in the Company s interests in MPA, as collateral for the loan. Magellan was required to use the borrowed amounts to satisfy transaction costs and pay certain outstanding accounts payable primarily related to the CO2 Business, to maintain its ongoing operations between signing of the Exchange Agreement and closing. The Note did not bear interest up until closing of the Exchange and was expected to be forgiven upon closing of the Exchange, and if the Exchange had not closed, would have become due and payable on August 1, 2016, or, in the case of a breach of the Exchange Agreement by One Stone, on August 1, 2017, and would have borne interest from the date of termination of the Exchange Agreement at a rate of the prime rate of interest plus   1%   (amounting to approximately   4.5%   at August 1, 2016). The Note is included in Notes Payable as of   June 30, 2016     in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Upon the closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016, the Loan Amount was deemed paid in full and no further amounts under the Note were owed by the Company.  

Note 9 - Fair Value Measurements    
  The Company follows authoritative guidance related to fair value measurement and disclosure, which establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement using market participant assumptions at the measurement date. A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows: 
             
    Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
                
    Level 2: Significant other observable inputs   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
                
    Level 3: Significant inputs to the valuation model that are unobservable inputs. 
     The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and the consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company's policy is to recognize transfers in or out of a fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period for which the event or change in circumstances caused the transfer. The Company has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed above for all periods presented. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3, except for the sale and acquisition of securities-available-for-sale, which securities are measured using Level 1 inputs consistently as discussed further below. 
  Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis 
  The Company's financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and current portion of notes payable reflect these items' cost, which approximates fair value based on the timing of the anticipated cash flows and current market conditions.  
  Items required   to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Company include securities available-for-sale and contingent consideration payable (as discussed further below). Within the valuation hierarchy, the Company measures the fair  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

value of securities available-for-sale using Level 1 inputs, and the fair value of contingent consideration payable using Level 3 inputs. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   June 30, 2016  , the fair value of securities available-for-sale was   $1.9 million   and   $601 thousand  , respectively. As of both   September 30, 2016  , and   June 30, 2016  , the fair value of contingent consideration payable was   $0  . The following table presents items required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the periods presented:    

   (1)    See   Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies   below for additional information about this item. 
  The contingent consideration payable as discussed in   Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies      - Contingent production payments is a potential standalone liability that is measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which there is no available quoted market price, principal market, or market participants. The inputs for this instrument are unobservable and therefore classified as Level 3 inputs. The calculation of this liability is a significant management estimate and uses drilling and production projections based in part on the Company's reserve report for NP to estimate future production bonus payments and a discount rate that is reflective of the Company's credit adjusted borrowing rate. The Company has retained future contingent production payments related to its September 2011 acquisition of NP following the closing of the Exchange with One Stone and has entered into an agreement with the beneficiaries to dispose of them upon closing of the Merger. 
  Inputs are reviewed by management on an annual basis or more frequently as deemed appropriate, and the potential liability is estimated by converting estimated future production bonus payments to a single net present value using a discounted cash flow model. Payments of future production bonuses are sensitive to the Poplar field's   60 days   rolling gross production average. The contingent consideration payable would increase with significant production increases and/or a reduction in the discount rate. 
  The Company has previously recorded a liability and resulting accretion expense for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration payable. Based upon the latest reserves estimates available to the Company, the contingent consideration payable is unlikely to be paid, and therefore, it is not recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Adjustments to the fair value of the contingent consideration payable are recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations under other (expense) income.  
  Assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis 
  Effective March 31, 2016, in connection with the Exchange Agreement and related classification of the assets and liabilities of the CO2 Business to held for sale, the Company reviewed the recoverability of the carrying values of its assets and liabilities to be transferred to One Stone in the Exchange, and as a result of this review recorded an impairment of   $11.3 million   to adjust the carrying values of the exchanged assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values at March 31, 2016. The inputs used to determine such fair values were based in part on a fairness opinion provided by a third party in connection with the Exchange and in part on internally developed cash flow models and are classified within Level 3 in the hierarchy. The impairment recorded consisted of an amount identifiable to proved oil and gas properties of   $7.8 million  , an amount identifiable to accounts receivable of   $100 thousand  , and the remainder to wells in progress of   $3.4 million  . As of August 1,

     Table of Contents  

2016, prior to disposition of these assets and liabilities in connection with closing the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, their adjusted carrying values representing their carrying values less costs to sell continued to approximately equal their fair values less costs to sell as determined at March 31, 2016.  
  The Company, in connection with the reclassification of the Weald Basin exploration licenses as held for sale, also reviewed the recoverability of those assets at   June 30, 2016  , and determined that since the purchase price per the Weald ATA and IoW ATA was greater than the carrying values of the assets, the assets and liabilities were properly recorded at the lower of their fair values, less the cost to sell at   June 30, 2016  .  As of August 11, 2016, prior to disposition of these assets in connection with closing of the transactions contemplated by the Weald Agreements, their adjusted carrying values representing their carrying values less costs to sell continued to approximately equal their fair values less costs to sell as determined at June 30, 2016.  
  The Company also utilizes fair value to perform an impairment test on its oil and gas properties and goodwill annually, or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying values may have occurred. Fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows from oil and gas properties. The inputs used to determine such fair value are primarily based upon internally developed cash flow models and are also classified within Level 3. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that no impairment to its remaining oil and gas properties and goodwill was necessary. 

Note 10 - Income Taxes    
  The Company has estimated the applicable effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year. The Company's effective tax rate used to estimate income taxes on a current year-to-date basis for each of the   three  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , was   0%  . Deferred tax assets ("DTAs") are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and foreign tax credit carry forwards. 
  We review our DTAs and valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results in recent years. Consistent with the position at   June 30, 2016  , the Company maintains a full valuation allowance recorded against all DTAs. The Company therefore had   no   recorded DTAs as of   September 30, 2016  . We anticipate that we will continue to record a valuation allowance against our DTAs in all jurisdictions of the Company until such time as we are able to determine that it is "more-likely-than-not" that those DTAs will be realized. 
  The Company has reported losses on discontinued operations for the   three  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , and because there is a full valuation allowance applied against the DTAs, the Company has not recorded any income tax benefit on discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  As a result of the closing of the Exchange, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company may have had an ownership change as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company has not yet concluded its analysis to determine whether a Section 382 ownership change has occurred; however, there should be no financial statement impact if there is a Section 382 ownership change, since the Company has a full valuation allowance against the DTAs and has not utilized any net operating losses as of   September 30, 2016  .   
  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the Company made a determination that it was no longer permanently invested in its foreign subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has an overall deferred tax asset net of a deferred tax liability related to the basis difference in its foreign subsidiaries. A valuation allowance reduces DTAs to the estimated realizable value, which is the amount of DTAs management believes is "more-likely-than-not" to be realized in future periods. 
  The Company does not expect to pay any federal or state income taxes for the fiscal year ending   June 30, 2017  . 

Note 11 - Stock-Based Compensation    
  The 2012 Stock Incentive Plan 
  On January 16, 2013, the Company's stockholders approved the Magellan Petroleum Corporation 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2012 Stock Incentive Plan"). The 2012 Stock Incentive Plan replaced the Company's 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1998 Stock Plan"). The 2012 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and/or restricted stock units, performance shares and/or performance units, incentive awards, cash awards, and other stock-based awards to selected employees, including officers, directors, and consultants of the Company (or subsidiaries of the Company). The stated maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock authorized for awards under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan is   625,000   shares plus the remaining number of shares under the 1998 Stock

     Table of Contents  

Plan immediately before the effective date of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, which was   36,054   as of January 15, 2013. The number of aggregate shares available for issuance will be reduced by   one   share for each share granted in the form of a stock option or stock appreciation right and   two   shares for each share granted in the form of any award that is not a stock option or stock appreciation right that is settled in stock. The maximum aggregate annual number of common shares or options that may be granted to one participant is   125,000  , and the maximum annual number of performance shares, performance units, restricted stock, or restricted stock units that may be granted to any one participant is   62,500  . The maximum term of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan is   ten   years.  
  During the year ended   June 30, 2016  ,   229,947   stock options previously granted under the 1998 Stock Plan expired without exercise. Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, the unissued shares underlying these unexercised options were added to the shares available for issuance under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. 
  In October 2014, the Company repurchased   189,062   options from a former executive, which options were previously granted under the Company's 1998 Stock Plan. Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, the unissued shares underlying these unexercised options were added to the shares available for issuance under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   67,471   shares available for issuance under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. 
  Stock Option Grants 
  Under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, stock option grants may contain vesting provisions such that options are TBOs, PBOs, or MBOs. During each of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , the Company granted   no   stock options.  
  Exercises 
  During each of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  ,   no   stock options were exercised.  
  Forfeitures / Cancellations 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   no   stock options were forfeited or canceled. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   6,250   stock options were forfeited or canceled.  
  Expirations 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   no   stock options expired without exercise. During the prior year period,   33,333   stock options expired without exercise. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   MBOs and PBOs that had not vested. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   no   options were issued outside of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. Stock options outstanding have expiration dates ranging from October 31, 2016, to January 12, 2025. 
  The following table summarizes the stock option activity for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)    Weighted average exercise price per share. 
       
  Stock Compensation Expense 
  The Company recorded   $590 thousand   and   $108 thousand   of related stock compensation expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Stock compensation expense is included in general and administrative expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The   $590 thousand   of stock compensation expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of expense amortization related to prior period awards of   $380 thousand  , including acceleration of expense related to the trigger of accelerated vesting provisions of certain awards and related release of forfeitures in connection with closing of the Exchange Agreement, and expense related to directors' stock awards as  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

described below. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the unrecorded expected future compensation expense related to stock option awards was   $33 thousand   and   $796 thousand  , respectively. 
  Stock Awards 
  The Company's director compensation policy is designed to provide the Company's non-employee directors with a portion of their annual base Board service compensation in the form of equity with a value equal to   $35 thousand  , with the determination of the exact number of shares to be made on July 1, or on the date of the subsequent annual stockholders' meeting (the "Stock Award"). In either case, the number of shares to be awarded is determined using the fair value of the shares as of July 1. In addition, there is an annual cash award alternative to the annual Stock Award whereby a non-employee director may elect to receive   $35 thousand   in cash to exercise previously awarded options to acquire common stock, the exercise price of which is at least equal in value to the common stock eligible for receipt by the director pursuant to the Stock Award (with the difference in value of the options and   $35 thousand   to be paid in cash, referred to as the Make-Up Payment). On July 3, 2015, the Special Committee determined that the directors' annual stock award would be deferred and revisited after the strategic alternatives review process had advanced further and liquidity issues have been addressed. As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company had not made the Stock Award payment that is to be determined as of July 1, but had accrued a total of   $175 thousand  , representing the   $35 thousand   equity value of the Stock Award to each non-employee director.  
  On August 1, 2016, in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement with One Stone, Messrs. Israel and Gluzman, One Stone s representatives on the Company s Board of Directors, i) agreed to forgo the amount of director compensation, in cash and stock, owed to them and outstanding as of the closing date, which was estimated at approximately   $174 thousand   in the aggregate and ii) ceased serving as members of the Board effective as of August 1, 2016.  
  On August 2, 2016, pursuant to the Company's director compensation policy and the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, a total of   119,505   shares of common stock were issued to the Company's non-employee directors, which represented the amount of stock compensation owed and outstanding to the remaining three directors of the Company, which were due to be issued on July 1, 2015 and 2016, and the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to these awards in the amount of   $210 thousand  . On September 6, 2016, the Company paid cash compensation owed and outstanding to the remaining three directors of the Company in the amount of   $201 thousand  .  
  On August 2, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved additional compensation for Messrs. MacMillan, Pettirossi, and West in consideration of i) their service as members of the Special Committee since its formation on June 5, 2015, which service had not been remunerated, and ii) the non-payment by the Company of their compensation as directors of the Company since July 2015, and agreed that this compensation would remain wholly contingent upon closing the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and would amount to the issuance of   100,000   shares of the Company's common stock and the payment of   $150 thousand   in cash, each in the aggregate. 
  On October 12, 2015, as further discussed in   Note 19 - Employee Retention and Severance Costs  , the Company granted   62,500   shares of restricted stock, a potential cash award based on the market value of the Company's common stock, and a phantom stock award based on the value of   62,500   notional shares, payable in cash, to Antoine J. Lafargue, all subject to doubling in certain circumstances under an override bonus agreement, payable in cash, and all vesting upon completion of a qualifying transaction.   No   stock-based compensation expense related to these grants has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations, as the Company does not consider the future events to meet the definition of "probable" due to the nature of the events being contingent upon third parties outside of the Company's control. 

Note 12 - Preferred Stock    
  Cancellation of Preferred Stock 
  Following closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement with One Stone, on August 1, 2016, the Company, having reacquired all of its outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, filed a Certificate of Elimination with the Delaware Secretary of State to remove the Certificate of Designations relating to the preferred stock from the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, thereby eliminating the Company's preferred stock. 
  One Stone Exchange 
  On March 31, 2016, Magellan and One Stone entered into the Exchange Agreement, as described further in   Note 3 - One Stone Exchange  . As a result of the execution of and conditions to the Exchange Agreement, the Company analyzed the redemption features of its Series A Preferred Stock and determined that as part of the Exchange, redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in the near term was probable.  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

The Company reviewed the recoverability of the carrying values of its assets and liabilities to be transferred to One Stone in the Exchange, and as a result of this review recorded an impairment of   $11.3 million   in discontinued operations for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , in order to adjust the carrying values of the exchanged assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values. The Company then determined that the resultant fair value of the net assets expected to be transferred to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in the Exchange was less than the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Company accordingly adjusted the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock to its original issue value of   $23.5 million  , reflecting a reduction in value for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , up to the amount of previously recorded increases in value for accumulated dividends paid-in-kind, such dividends totaling   $4.2 million   in the aggregate at   June 30, 2016  . For the period from July 1, 2016 through closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement on August 1, 2016, the Company again recorded a reduction in value in the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock for recorded increases during that same period for accumulated dividends paid in kind of   $162 thousand  .  
  On August 1, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement closed, resulting in the transfer of the CO2 Business to One Stone in exchange for the redemption of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock. The excess of the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus the cash received and loan forgiven in the Exchange over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the CO2 Business transferred amounted to   $9.9 million   and was recorded as a contribution to capital in excess of par value from the preferred stockholder.  
  Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Financing 
  On   May 10, 2013  , the Company entered into a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Series A Purchase Agreement") with One Stone. Pursuant to the terms of the Series A Purchase Agreement, on   May 17, 2013  , the Company issued to One Stone   19,239,734   shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value   $0.01   per share, at a purchase price of approximately   $1.22149381   per share (the "Purchase Price"), for aggregate proceeds of approximately   $23.5 million  . Subject to certain conditions, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any related unpaid accumulated dividends were convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, using a face amount per share of the Series A Preferred Stock based on the Purchase Price, and dividing by a conversion price of   $9.77586545   per share, which conversion price has been adjusted to reflect the one share-for-eight shares reverse split of the Company's common stock effective July 10, 2015. Please refer to Note 12 - Preferred Stock of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2016 Form 10-K for further information regarding key terms and registration rights that were applicable to the Company's Series A Preferred Stock. 
  Preferred Stock Dividends 
  For the period from July 1, 2016 through closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement on August 1, 2016, the Company recorded preferred stock dividends of   $162 thousand   related to the Series A Preferred Stock, which dividends were payable in kind to One Stone. Accordingly, the value of these dividends of   $162 thousand   was recorded and added to the preferred stock balance on the Company's balance sheet at August 1, 2016, prior to the adjustment to redemption value as a result of the One Stone Exchange and the redemption discussed above. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded preferred stock dividends of   $452 thousand   related to the Series A Preferred Stock. The preferred stock dividends for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , were also paid in kind.  
  The activity related to the Series A Preferred Stock for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  , is as follows:

  Reverse Stock Split 
  On July 10, 2015, pursuant to the Company's definitive proxy statement filed on June 8, 2015, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors within a specific range set forth in the proxy statement, without reducing the number of authorized shares. The Company's shareholders approved the proposed amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and the Board of Directors selected a reverse split ratio of one-for-eight (1:8). As a result of the reverse stock split, as of the close of business on July 10, 2015, each eight shares of common stock were converted into one share of common stock with any fractional shares being settled in cash. Immediately preceding the reverse stock split, there were   55,313,647   shares of common stock issued, including   9,675,114   treasury shares. The number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock did not change as a result of the split; however, following the reverse stock split, the conversion price was adjusted to reflect the split from   $1.22149381   to   $9.77586545  .  
  After the reverse stock split, there were   6,911,921   shares of common stock issued, including   1,209,389   treasury shares. All share and per share amounts relating to the common stock, stock options to purchase common stock, including the respective exercise prices of each such option, and the conversion ratio of the Series A Preferred Stock included in the financial statements and footnotes have been adjusted to reflect the reduced number of shares resulting from the reverse stock split. Market conditions tied to stock price targets contained within MBOs were similarly adjusted. The par value and the number of authorized, but unissued, shares remain unchanged following the reverse stock split.

OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY 
  Magellan Petroleum Corporation (the "Company" or "Magellan" or "MPC" or "we") is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Subject to the closing of the announced merger with Tellurian Investments Inc. ( Tellurian ), Magellan will become a company focused on the development of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) projects along the United States Gulf Coast and complementary business lines in the energy industry. Historically active internationally, Magellan also owns interests in the Horse Hill-1 well and related licenses in the Weald Basin, onshore UK, and an exploration block, NT/P82, in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia. 
   The Company conducts its operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries corresponding to the geographical areas in which the Company operates: Magellan Petroleum (UK) Limited ("MPUK") in the UK, and Magellan Petroleum Australia Pty Ltd ("MPA") in Australia. Following the closing of the merger with Tellurian, which is expected in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 or the first quarter of calendar year 2017, the combined company will operate its LNG business in the US through its new wholly owned subsidiary, Tellurian. 
  We believe that Magellan s sources of value are embedded in the Company s platform and portfolio of assets. Magellan s strategy is therefore focused on recovering shareholder value by realizing the value of its existing assets. 
  We were founded in 1957 and incorporated in Delaware in 1967. The Company's common stock has been trading on the NASDAQ since 1972 under the ticker symbol "MPET". 
  Our principal offices are located at 1775 Sherman Street, Suite 1950, Denver, Colorado, 80203, and our telephone number is (720) 484-2400.  

SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The Company has incurred losses from operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , of   $2.2 million  .  In addition, the Company's cash balance has decreased to   $892 thousand   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  The Company continues to experience liquidity constraints. We believe there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Because Tellurian's assets do not currently generate revenues, the combined company is also likely to experience liquidity constraints. However, we believe that upon the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the combined company will be better positioned to raise capital to fund the combined company's operations due to the attributes of Tellurian's business plan and management. Therefore, we believe that Magellan's ability to continue as a going concern in the short-term is subject to the closing of the merger with Tellurian. However, following the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the combined company may not be able to raise sufficient capital in a timely manner to fund the operations of the combined company. Should the merger with Tellurian not close, the Company will need to pursue other alternatives in order to continue as a going concern. 
  As a result of the transactions related to the strategic alternatives review process, the assets and operations of NP, Utah CO2, and the Weald Basin were reclassified to held for sale and discontinued operations, respectively, until their ultimate disposition during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Therefore, the Company does not report revenues herein, and the results of continuing operations herein exclude the results of these discontinued operations.

Loss from continuing operations  .   For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , loss from continuing operations, including preferred stock dividends and an adjustment to redemption value of the preferred stock, totaled   $2.2 million   (  $0.38   loss/basic share), compared to a loss from continuing operations, including preferred stock dividends of   $2.5 million   (  $0.44   loss/basic share) in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in loss from continuing operations of   $547 thousand   was due to i) a reduction in preferred stock dividends of   $290 thousand  , ii) an adjustment to the redemption value of the preferred stock in the current year period of   $162 thousand   and iii) a realized loss in the prior year period of   $261 thousand   on the sale of available-for-sale securities related to the Company's investment in Central Petroleum, which were partially offset by increases in exploration expenses of   $138 thousand  , general and administrative expenses of   $263 thousand  , and a decrease in other income of   $23 thousand  .  
  Cash  . As of   September 30, 2016  , Magellan had   $892 thousand   in cash and cash equivalents, compared to   $1.7 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The decrease of   $788 thousand   was the result of net cash used in operating activities of   $1.9 million  , which included primarily payment of transaction costs associated with the Exchange and the Merger, net cash used in financing activities of   $73 thousand  , net cash used in operating and investing activities of discontinued operations of   $307 thousand  , and a net decrease in cash from the effect of exchange rate changes of   $15 thousand  , which were offset by net cash provided by investing activities of   $1.5 million  , primarily related to proceeds from the Exchange and the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA.  
  Securities available-for-sale.   As of   September 30, 2016  , Magellan had securities available for sale amounting to approximately   $1.9 million  , consisting of the Company's investment in shares of Central stock and UK Oil and Gas Investment Plc ("UKOG") stock amounting to approximately   $692 thousand   and   $1.2 million  , respectively.  

CORPORATE EVENTS 
  Exchange Agreement 
  On March 31, 2016, Magellan and One Stone entered into an Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ). The Exchange Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, One Stone would transfer to the Company 100% of the outstanding shares of Magellan Series A convertible preferred stock (the  Preferred Stock ), in consideration for the assignment to and assumption by One Stone of 100% of the outstanding membership interests in Nautilus Poplar LLC, and 51% of the outstanding common units in Utah CO2 LLC ( Utah CO2 , and together with Nautilus Poplar LLC, the "CO2 Business"), as adjusted by the Cash Amount (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) (the  Exchange ). On August 1, 2016, all the conditions to the closing of the Exchange were met and the Exchange was consummated. The primary conditions to closing included i) the receipt of the approval of the Exchange by the Company s stockholders, which was received on July 13, 2016, during the Company s annual and special meeting of the stockholders, ii) the consent of West Texas State Bank ("WTSB") to release a guaranty provided by Magellan, and iii) the payment of the Cash Amount. 
  The Exchange Agreement was given economic effect as of September 30, 2015. The purpose of the Cash Amount was primarily to reimburse the Company for the funding of the operations of the Poplar field during the period between September 30, 2015, and the closing of the Exchange. On August 1, 2016, One Stone paid the Cash Amount to the Company, which was agreed to amount to $900 thousand. In addition, Messrs. Israel and Gluzman, One Stone s representatives on the Company s Board of Directors, i) agreed to forgo the amount of director compensation, in cash and stock, owed to them and outstanding as of the closing date, which was estimated at approximately $174 thousand in the aggregate, and ii) ceased serving as members of the Board effective as of August 1, 2016. 
  Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on April 15, 2016, Magellan and One Stone i) entered into a Secured Promissory Note (the  Note ) pursuant to which One Stone made a loan to Magellan in the aggregate amount of   $625 thousand   (the  Loan Amount ) and ii) simultaneously entered into a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which Magellan pledged, assigned and granted to One Stone a security interest in the Company s interests in MPA, as collateral for the loan. The purpose of the Note was primarily to fund the payment of outstanding payables with certain vendors of the CO2 Business to maintain its ongoing operations between signing of the Exchange Agreement and closing of the Exchange. At the closing of the Exchange, the Loan Amount was deemed to be paid in full and no further amounts under the Note were owed by the Company. Also, One Stone assumed all assets and virtually all liabilities related to the CO2 Business, which included a term loan (the "Term Loan") with WTSB and outstanding accounts payable related to the CO2 Business. 
  Merger with Tellurian 
  On August 2, 2016, Magellan, Tellurian, and River Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan ( Merger Sub ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Tellurian will be exchanged for 1.300 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Magellan, and Merger Sub will merge with and into Tellurian (the  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

Merger ), with Tellurian continuing as the surviving corporation, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan, and the accounting acquirer. The Merger Agreement and the Merger have been approved by the board of directors of each of Magellan and Tellurian. Stockholders of Magellan will be asked to vote on the approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement at a special meeting that is expected to be held during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 or the first quarter of calendar year 2017. 
  In addition to the approval of the foregoing matters by the stockholders, the closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including i) the receipt of Magellan and Tellurian stockholder approval; ii) all directors and officers of Magellan shall have resigned, except for any person(s) that might be designated by Tellurian; iii) a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the Magellan shares to be issued in the Merger shall have been declared effective by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC  and iv) shares of Magellan common stock to be issued in the Merger shall have been approved for listing on the NASDAQ. The Merger Agreement also contains a non-solicitation provision pursuant to which Magellan may not, directly or indirectly, take certain actions to negotiate or otherwise facilitate an  Alternative Proposal,  a term generally defined as an inquiry, proposal or offer relating to a business combination with or acquisition of the assets of Magellan by a person or entity other than Tellurian. Magellan s non-solicitation obligations are qualified by  fiduciary out  provisions which provide that Magellan may take certain otherwise prohibited actions with respect to an unsolicited Alternative Proposal if the Board of Directors determines that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and certain other requirements are satisfied. 
  The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including in specified circumstances in connection with receipt of a "Superior Proposal," as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement. In connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement in the event of a Superior Proposal, a breach by Magellan of the non-solicitation provision noted above, or following a change by the Board of Directors of its recommendation to stockholders, Magellan will be required to pay to Tellurian a termination fee for any and all third-party transaction fees and expenses incurred by Tellurian with the drafting, negotiation, execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and related documents (including fees and expenses for attorneys, accountants and other advisors), subject to a maximum of $1 million in the aggregate. A termination fee may also be payable in some circumstances in which an Alternative Proposal is made, the transaction fails to close and Magellan subsequently agrees to an Alternative Proposal. If the Merger Agreement is terminated by either party as a result of the failure to obtain the requisite approval by Tellurian stockholders, or by Magellan because Tellurian does not use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the approval for listing the Magellan shares of common stock to be issued in the Merger, then Tellurian will be required to pay to Magellan a reverse termination fee of $1 million. 
  Post-Merger Strategy 
  Upon the closing of the Merger with Tellurian, Magellan will become a Houston-based energy company focusing on the development of LNG projects along the United States Gulf Coast and complementary business lines in the energy industry.  
  Tellurian s management team is led by Charif Souki, Martin Houston, and Meg Gentle, who have led and/or founded several industry-leading companies, specifically in the LNG sector. Mr. Souki is the former founder, Chairman, and CEO of Cheniere Energy, Inc. ("Cheniere"), which is expected to operate in excess of 30 million tonne per annum ( mtpa ) of LNG export facilities. Mr. Houston retired in November 2013, as chief operating officer of BG Group plc ( BG ), after 30 years of service, during which he pioneered the development and optimization of BG s global LNG portfolio. Meg Gentle will serve as CEO of the combined Company, following a career during which she held various executive roles at Cheniere, including CFO and executive vice president of marketing. Tellurian was formed in February 2016.  
  The combined company plans to own, develop and operate, through Tellurian LNG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Tellurian ( Tellurian LNG ), natural gas liquefaction facilities, storage facilities and loading terminals (collectively, the  LNG Facilities ) at one or more sites along the United States Gulf Coast and plans to sell LNG produced at its LNG Facilities to creditworthy customers, and to pursue complementary business lines in the energy industry. The combined company plans to be a low-cost provider of LNG Facilities and plans to minimize construction costs through utilization of proven technology and a modular design process that reduces installation and interconnection costs throughout the facility. Tellurian LNG, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Driftwood LNG LLC and Driftwood LNG Pipeline LLC, is developing a 26-mtpa LNG Facility and related pipeline in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, with estimated construction costs of $450 to $550 per tonne, before owners  cost, pipeline cost, financing cost, and contingencies, and expects to begin producing LNG in 2022 (the  Driftwood LNG Project ). The combined company also plans to pursue business that is complementary to its LNG business. The combined company plans to purchase gas supply for its LNG Facilities from the North American natural gas market and contract for pipeline and storage services upstream of the LNG Facilities in order to maximize its access to low-cost gas supply. 
  Immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Magellan expects to file a certificate of amendment to Magellan s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and to amend Magellan s bylaws for the purpose of effecting a name change of the company from  Magellan Petroleum Corporation  to  Tellurian Inc.  Pursuant to Section 242 
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

(b)(1) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and the bylaws of Magellan, the name change will not require stockholder approval but will need to be approved by the board of directors of the combined company. The name change will not affect the rights of Magellan s existing stockholders. There will be no other changes to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of Magellan in connection with the name change. 
  Management Changes 
  On and effective August 5, 2016, Mr. Wilson, the Company s director, President, and Chief Executive Officer, tendered his resignation as a director and officer, and Mr. Lafargue assumed the additional officer responsibilities until the closing of the Merger. At the closing of the Merger, Tellurian s management team is expected to assume most of the managerial positions of the Company, with Mr. Lafargue expected to continue as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company. 
  Special Committee 
  On June 5, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors formed the Special Committee to consider various strategic alternatives potentially available to the Company and engaged Petrie Partners, LLC ("Petrie") as financial advisor. Following the closing of the Exchange with One Stone, the subsequently announced Merger with Tellurian and the departures of Messrs. Israel, Gluzman, and Wilson from the Board, we believe that the task of the Special Committee has substantially been completed and on September 26, 2016, the Board disbanded the Special Committee. 
  Central Weald Sale 
  On June 10, 2016, MPUK entered into i) an Asset Transfer Agreement relating to the sale to UKOG of MPUK's 50% interests in PEDLs 231, 234, and 243 (the "Weald ATA"), ii) an Asset Transfer Agreement relating to the sale to UKOG of MPUK's 22.5% interest in the Offshore Petroleum Licence P1916 (the "IoW ATA"), and iii) a Settlement Agreement with Celtique (the"Settlement Agreement"). The consideration payable by UKOG to MPUK for the Weald ATA amounted to    1.8 million   in a combination of cash and shares of UKOG, the number and value of which shares was determined as of the time of execution of the Weald ATA. The consideration for the IoW ATA was the assumption of MPUK's outstanding payables related to its interests in the Offshore Petroleum Licence P1916. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, MPUK was due to pay Celtique    500 thousand   of the gross consideration, in a combination of cash and shares in UKOG pro rata to the consideration payable to MPUK for the Weald ATA. On August 11, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA and IoW ATA closed and the Settlement Agreement became effective, resulting in net cash proceeds to Magellan of    446 thousand   and the net issuance to Magellan of approximately   50.9 million   shares of UKOG, which shares were worth approximately    713 thousand   at the time of closing. The number of shares of UKOG issued to Magellan was determined at the signing of the agreements based on a price per share of    0.01575  , and as of   November 9, 2016  , the price per share of UKOG was    0.01400  . 
  Poplar Contingent Payments Purchase 
  On September 30, 2016, the Company, with Tellurian's consent, entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the  Poplar Contingent Payment Agreement ) with the former owners of the membership interests in Nautilus Technical Group LLC ( Nautilus Technical ) and Eastern Rider LLC ( Eastern Rider ), an entity controlled by J. Thomas Wilson, former CEO and director of the Company (the  Sellers ). Pursuant to the Poplar Contingent Payment Agreement and subject to the closing of the Merger with Tellurian, the Company has agreed to issue to the Sellers an aggregate of 90,350 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for all rights of the Sellers to payments of up to $5.0 million potentially payable by the Company to the Sellers, which payments are contingent on certain production thresholds of the Poplar field formerly owned by the Company. The right to these contingent production payments resulted from a purchase and sale agreement entered into in September 2011, pursuant to which the Company initially acquired its interests in the Poplar field. The shares issuable under the Poplar Contingent Payment Agreement will be issued, and the contingent production payment right terminated, promptly following the completion of the Merger. 
  NASDAQ Listing Requirements 
  On May 17, 2016, Magellan received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ indicating that the Company s stockholders  equity as reported in the Company s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016 did not meet the minimum $2.5 million required for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5550(b)(1). On June 30, 2016, the Company submitted materials to NASDAQ describing a number of transactions that it believed would enable it to report stockholders  equity of approximately $4.1 million on a pro forma basis, as of March 31, 2016, and that it was engaged in negotiations with a specific party to enter into a potential business combination transaction. On July 29, 2016, Magellan received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ indicating that it had determined to grant Magellan an extension until October 14, 2016 to regain compliance with Rule 5550(b). In the letter dated July 29, 2016, the Listing Qualifications Department indicated that any future business combination with a non-NASDAQ entity would likely be considered a  change of control  of Magellan, which would require the post-combination company to apply for initial listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market and meet all applicable initial listing criteria. On October 18, 2016, Magellan received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

indicating that based on the Form 10-K filed by Magellan for its fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  , which included a pro forma consolidated balance sheet evidencing stockholders' equity of   $3.7 million  , the Company had regained compliance with NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5550(b)(1), and that if the Company fails to evidence compliance upon filing its next periodic report, it may be subject to delisting. 

HIGHLIGHTS OF OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , in parallel with the ongoing strategic alternatives review process, the Company continued to operate its projects to evaluate and determine the potential of its exploration and production properties. 
  Poplar (Montana, USA) 
  Following the closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016, the Company does not own or operate the Poplar field.  
  CO   2   -EOR pilot project  .     During the period between July 1, 2016 and the closing of the Exchange, oil continued to be produced from one of the producing wells of the CO   2   -EOR pilot project. 
  Shallow Intervals  . During the period between July 1, 2016 and the closing of the Exchange, Magellan sold   4   Mbbls (  129   bopd) of oil attributable to its net revenue interests in Poplar. This production came primarily from production from the Charles formation. 
  Deep Intervals  . During the period between July 1, 2016 and the closing of the Exchange, there was no production from the Deep Intervals at Poplar. 
  United Kingdom 
  Weald Basin Licenses  . On August 11, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA closed, resulting in the Company s disposal of its interests in PEDLs 231, 234, and 243. Pursuant to the terms of the Weald ATA and considering the expiration of the term of these licenses on June 30, 2016, Celtique Energie Weald Ltd and Magellan relinquished their respective interests in PEDLs 231 and 243. No substantial operational activity occurred in relation to these licenses prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA. 
  Horse Hill  . Pursuant to a farmout agreement with Horse Hill Development, Ltd ("HHDL") dated as of December 20, 2013, the Company holds a 35% interest in PEDLs 137 and 246, where the Horse Hill-1 well ("HH-1") was drilled. In accordance with the farmout agreement, the Company s costs in relation to these licenses are 100% carried by HHDL until production, including costs related to conducting flow tests. During the first quarter of calendar year 2016, HHDL conducted a successful flow test of several formations of HH-1, including the Portland sandstone and two Kimmeridge limestone formations. UKOG, one of the principal interest owners of HHDL, then reported that the flow tests measured a stable dry oil rate of 1,688 barrels of oil per day in aggregate from these formations. Although the duration of the flow tests of each formation was relatively short, we were very encouraged by these results.  
  On October 17, 2016, UKOG announced that HHDL informed UKOG that i) a planning application was submitted to Surrey County Council seeking permission to conduct further significant appraisal testing and drilling at PEDL 137, ii) subject to the required regulatory approvals, the first phase of the proposed development was planned to consist of the extended production testing of four zones, designed to confirm the commerciality of the discovery, and to examine a previously untested Kimmeridge limestone, and iii) the planning application also sought permission for a two-well drilling phase, contingent upon successful testing, to further appraise the extent of the oil accumulations and the field's production capabilities, which drilling phase would consist of a deviated sidetrack, HH-1z, to be drilled from the existing HH-1 borehole and a new well, Horse Hill-2. UKOG also reported that the normal local planning authority cycle for an application not requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment such as at Horse Hill takes approximately 13 weeks. 
  Other UK Licenses  . On August 11, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the IoW ATA closed, resulting in the Company s disposal of its interest in P1916, located offshore southern UK, near the Isle of Wight. No substantial activity occurred in relation to P1916 prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the IoW ATA. 
  Australia 
  NT/P82  . On June 29, 2016, the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator ( NOPTA ) informed the Company that the Commonwealth-Northern Territory Offshore Petroleum Joint Authority approved the following variations of the term of the NT/P82 Exploration Permit in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia: i) the increase of the Year 6 minimum work requirement from 600 km   2    of 3D seismic survey to 1,000 km   2    new seismic data acquisition and processing and geological and geophysical studies, ii) the suspension of Year 6 conditions of title for 18 months, and iii) the extension of the  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

permit term by 18 months to allow the varied minimum work condition to be undertaken. As a result of these variations, the term of the license is now due to end on November 12, 2017. 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company considered its strategic alternatives in relation to its 100% interest in NT/P82. 

CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company used   $788 thousand   in cash and, as of   September 30, 2016  , had   $892 thousand   in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the transactions contemplated by the Exchange and the Weald ATA were consummated, resulting in net cash proceeds of   $900 thousand   and    446 thousand  , respectively, and the net issuance to Magellan of approximately   50.9 million   shares of UKOG. Following these transactions, and in light of the Company's stringent management of its cash disbursements over the past year, the Company paid certain outstanding invoices, which resulted in the reduction of the Company s outstanding payables from   $791 thousand   as of June 30, 2016 to   $519 thousand   as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, following the closing of the Exchange, the Company s cash position was not negatively impacted by the negative cash flows from operations generated by the Poplar field, and the Company s remaining assets consisting of the HH-1 well and NT/P82 have not generated, and in the short term are not expected to generate, substantial disbursements. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Exchange Agreement, the Company expects it will not have sources of revenues, and its expenses will primarily relate to ongoing transaction expenses and public company costs. The Company estimates that its monthly cash burn rate should amount to approximately   $200 thousand   to   $250 thousand  , subject to potential increases related to transaction costs related to the closing of the Merger. The Company believes that it will be able to finance its activities until the closing of the Merger with Tellurian, which is expected during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 or the first quarter of calendar year 2017 using a combination of its cash on hand and the potential disposal of part or all of its shareholdings of Central. In addition, the Company's ability to dispose of its remaining assets is subject to Tellurian's consent, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
  However, the Company continues to experience significant liquidity constraints in the short term. We believe there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Because Tellurian's assets do not currently generate revenues, the combined company is also likely to experience liquidity constraints. However, we believe that upon the closing of the Merger with Tellurian, the combined company will be better positioned to raise capital to fund the combined company's operations due to the attributes of Tellurian's business plan and management. Therefore, we believe that Magellan's ability to continue as a going concern in the short-term is subject to the closing of the Merger with Tellurian. However, following the closing of the Merger with Tellurian, the combined company may not be able to raise sufficient capital in a timely manner to fund the operations of the combined company. Should the Merger with Tellurian not close, the Company will need to pursue other alternatives in order to continue as a going concern. 
  Uses of Funds 
  Capital Expenditure Plans.   Due to the closing of the Exchange, the Company will no longer incur any capital expenditures in relation to the Poplar field. 
  In the UK in PEDLs 137 and 246, where HH-1 was drilled, the cost of the completed flow test and potential future extended flow test are due to be fully paid by HHDL in accordance with the terms of the farmout agreement between HHDL and MPUK. 
  In the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Australia, the Company holds a 100% interest in NT/P82. The Company has received an extension of the term of its permit to November 2017 and is reviewing its strategic alternatives in relation to its interests. In the event that the Company concludes that it is required to relinquish its interest in the license, the Company does not expect to incur any material financial obligation. 
  Series A Preferred Dividend  . Following the closing on August 1, 2016, of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement with One Stone, One Stone transferred to the Company, and the Company subsequently canceled, 100% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including accumulated dividends paid in kind. The Company does not have any remaining amounts due or outstanding in connection with the Series A Preferred Stock. 
  Contractual Obligations.   Please refer to the contractual obligations table in Part II, Item 7 of our 2016 Form 10-K for information on all material contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016, and see   Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies     to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.

On a consolidated basis, the Company had approximately   $892 thousand   of cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.7 million   as of   June 30, 2016  , and   $526 thousand   as of   November 9, 2016  . The Company considers cash equivalents to be short term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near to their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates.  
  Due to the international components of its operations, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks and certain legal and tax constraints in matching the capital needs of its assets and its cash resources. To the extent that the Company repatriates cash amounts from MPUK or MPA to the US, the Company is potentially liable for incremental US federal and state income tax, which may be reduced by the US federal and state net operating loss and foreign tax credit carry forwards available to the Company at that time. However, upon the closing of the Merger, which constitutes a change in control, there is a risk that most of the Company's tax attributes may not be available to the Company to reduce the Company's potential US federal and state income taxes.  
  Central Shares.   Due to the closing of the Exchange, the Company is no longer subject to any restrictions in its ability to sell its remaining shares of Central. As of   September 30, 2016  , and as of   November 9, 2016  , the Company owns   8.2 million   shares of Central.     Based on the closing price on   November 9, 2016  , the shares of Central stock represent   $791 thousand   of additional potential liquidity. In the future, Magellan may decide to dispose of all or part of its position in Central stock to fund some of the Company's activities. Although the Company does not intend to hold its position in Central's stock over the long term, the Company believes that there could be certain commercial or operational developments related to Central s assets, which could positively impact the price per share of Central in the medium term. Therefore, the Company intends to monitor the stock price performance of Central to determine the appropriate time to dispose of its position.  
  UKOG Shares.   On August 11, 2016, the Company received   50.9 million   shares of UKOG, which are listed on the AIM market in the UK, as part of the consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA. However, pursuant to the terms of the Weald ATA, which include a six-month lock-up period, the Company may not sell its shares of UKOG until February 10, 2017. Considering the current volume of trading activity of UKOG shares, the Company believes that it will be able to dispose of its shareholdings effectively once it decides to monetize these shares. The Company does not consider its shareholdings in UKOG to constitute a core asset of the Company and will monitor the performance of the price per share of UKOG and the operational results of HH-1 and UKOG s other assets to determine the appropriate time to dispose of its shareholdings. Based on the price per share of UKOG as of   November 9, 2016  , the Company s shareholdings in UKOG amounted to approximately   $886 thousand  . 
  Existing Credit Facilities.   A summary of the Company's existing credit facilities is as follows: 

Insurance Premium Notes.   Between January 2016 and September 2016, the Company entered into three separate insurance premium financing agreements (the "Premium Notes") to finance the insurance premiums related to the annual renewal of the Company's insurance policies. The Premium Notes have an aggregate original principal amount of   $262 thousand  , bear interest ranging between   6.25%   and   7.75%  , and have amortization terms from   eight   to   ten   months. The aggregate principal and interest payments due monthly under the Premium Notes range between   $27 thousand   and   $2 thousand  , and are payable between   October 2016   and   May 2017  . 
  Secured Promissory Note.   Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on April 15, 2016, Magellan and One Stone i) entered into a Secured Promissory Note (the  Note ) pursuant to which One Stone made a loan to Magellan in the aggregate amount of   $625 thousand   (the  Loan Amount ) and ii) simultaneously entered into a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which Magellan pledged, assigned and granted to One Stone a security interest in the Company s interests in MPA, as collateral for the loan. The purpose of the Note was to finance certain ongoing operations at Poplar between signing of the Exchange Agreement and closing. The Note did not bear interest up until closing of the Exchange. The Note is included in Notes Payable at   June 30, 2016     in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Upon the closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016, the Loan Amount was deemed paid in full and the Pledge Agreement was terminated, and no further amounts under the Note were owed by the Company.

     Table of Contents  

Term Loan.   The Company, through its former wholly owned subsidiary NP, had maintained the Term Loan with WTSB, which, upon closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016, was assumed by One Stone pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement.  
  Registered Equity Facility  . On December 24, 2014, the Company implemented an "at-the-market" (ATM) facility under which the Company can raise up to $10 million through the issuance of new common shares into the market. The ATM facility is registered under the Company's "shelf" registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Shelf"), which was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on November 17, 2014, and which went effective on December 3, 2014. The Shelf registered the issuance of up to $100 million in equity securities of the Company and is currently planned to be effective through December 2017. 
  Depending on various factors, including market conditions for the Company's equity securities, the Company may use the ATM facility and the Shelf on an as-needed basis for general corporate purposes. The Company has no immediate plans to issue shares pursuant to the ATM facility or the Shelf, which are intended to provide financial flexibility going forward. As of the date hereof, no securities have been issued under either the Shelf or the ATM facility. 
  Other Sources of Financing.   In addition to its existing liquid capital resources and the alternatives to address short-term liquidity issues discussed above, the Company could potentially receive funds through a bridge financing pending the closing of the Merger or the pledge of some of its remaining unencumbered assets or through equity issuances via a PIPE or follow-on offering. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table presents the Company's cash flow information for the   three   months ended: 

Cash   used in   operating activities during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , totaled   $1.9 million  , compared to cash   used in   operating activities of   $0.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the current year period of   $561 thousand   and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the prior year period of   $852 thousand  , which was offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation and foreign currency gains of   $222 thousand  .  
  Cash   provided by   investing activities during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   amounted to   $1.5 million  , compared to cash provided by investing activities of   $836 thousand   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to cash proceeds received including cash retained of   $950 thousand   at the closing of the Exchange, and the cash proceeds received relating to the Weald Basin ATA of   $586 thousand  , which were offset by a reduction in proceeds from sales of Central stock of   $836 thousand   received during the same period in   2015  .  
  Cash   used in   financing activities during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $73 thousand  , compared to cash used of   $40 thousand   in the prior year period. Cash   used in   financing activities in the current year period was primarily due to payments on the Company's insurance notes payable of   $70 thousand  . Cash used in the prior year period related to payments made for deferred financing costs of   $24 thousand   and cash payments for the repurchase of stock for settlement of taxes of   $10 thousand  .  
  Cash used in discontinued operations during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $307 thousand  , compared to   $254 thousand   in the prior year period. Cash used in discontinued operations in the current year primarily related to transaction costs paid as a result of the Exchange of   $278 thousand  . Cash used in the prior year period primarily related to capital expenditures at the Poplar field of   $122 thousand  .

     Table of Contents  

During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates   negatively   impacted the translation of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalent balances into US dollars and resulted in   a decrease   of   $15 thousand   in cash and cash equivalents, compared to   a decrease   of   $178 thousand   for the same period in   2015  . 

COMPARISON OF RESULTS BETWEEN THE   THREE MONTHS ENDED     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   AND   2015 
    
  Operating Expenses 
  The following table presents operating expenses for the   three   months ended: 

Depreciation Expense.   Depreciation expense   decreased   by   $8 thousand   to   $11 thousand   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $19 thousand   in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the current year period.  
  Exploration Expenses.   Exploration expenses   increased   by   $138 thousand   to   $155 thousand   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in expenditures related to the Company's activities in the UK in the current year period. 
  General and Administrative Expenses.   The following table presents general and administrative expenses for the   three   months ended: 

General and administrative expenses   increased   by   $263 thousand  , or   15%  , to   $2.0 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior year period. General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and foreign transaction losses, decreased by   $222 thousand  , or   15%  , to   $1.3 million  . This decrease was primarily the result of reductions in expenses related to corporate office salaries and benefits of   $308 thousand  , director expenses of   $481 thousand  , office rent of   $42 thousand  , which were partially offset by an increase in professional fees of   $531 thousand   related to the Merger, and a increase in general administrative expenses related to our foreign subsidiaries of   $65 thousand  . Stock compensation expense increased   $482 thousand   primarily due to the vesting of certain stock awards as a result of the Exchange. Foreign transaction losses increased by   $3 thousand  . 
  Net Loss From Discontinued Operations 
  Net income from discontinued operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $830 thousand   relates to the  gain on disposal of the Company's Weald Basin assets in the UK of   $1.1 million  , which was partially offset by a loss on operations of the Company's former NP segment and transaction costs related to the Exchange of   $239 thousand  . 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  The Company does not use off-balance sheet arrangements, such as securitization of receivables, with any unconsolidated entities or other parties.

EFFECTS OF COMMODITY PRICES  
  Following the closing of the Exchange on August 1, 2016, the Company does not presently sell hydrocarbons from its properties and does not have estimated reserves associated with its remaining assets. However, the value of each of the Company s remaining assets is intrinsically impacted by commodity prices, including the value of their potential monetization. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  Information regarding critical accounting policies and estimates is contained in Item 7 of our 2016 Form 10-K. There have been no changes to the Company's critical accounting policies during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
  The Company is exposed to market risk in the form of foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk related to world prices for crude oil, and equity price risk related to investments in marketable securities. The exchange rates between the Australian dollar and the US dollar and the exchange rates between the British pound and US dollar have changed in recent periods, and may fluctuate substantially in the future. With respect to any net proceeds from the planned farmout of NT/P82 in Australia, any appreciation of the US dollar against the Australian dollar is expected to result in weaker operating results. With respect to any net expenditures for development in the UK, any material appreciation of the US dollar against the British pound could have a positive impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our investments in securities available for sale was   $1.9 million  , with   $693 thousand   of that amount attributable to the   8.2 million   shares held as of   September 30, 2016   from the   39.5 million   Central shares received initially as part of the consideration for the sale of the Amadeus Basin assets in March 2014. Central's stock is traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (the "ASX"), and we determined the fair value of our investment in Central using Central's closing stock price on the ASX on   September 30, 2016  , of   A$0.110   per share, which translated to   $0.084   per share in US dollars on that date. Due to the number of Central shares that we own and Central's general daily trading volumes, we may not be able to obtain the currently quoted market price in the event we elect to sell our Central shares. The remaining   $1.2 million   of the fair value of our investments in securities held for sale is attributable to   50.9 million   shares of UKOG acquired as part of the consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA, which closed on August 11, 2016. UKOG's stock is traded on the AIM market in the UK, and we determined the the fair value of our investment in UKOG using UKOG's closing stock price on   September 30, 2016  , of    0.01825   per share, which translated to   $0.02335   per share in US dollars on that date. Pursuant to the terms of the Weald ATA, which include a six-month lock-up period, the Company may not sell its shares of UKOG until February 10, 2017. Considering the current volume of trading activity of UKOG shares, the Company believes that it will be able to dispose of its shareholdings effectively once it decides to monetize these shares. In addition, a 10% across-the-board change in the underlying equity market price per share for our investments would result in a   $190 thousand   change in the fair value of our investments. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  
  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of certain members of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive and Financial Officer, the Company completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in SEC Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive and Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive and Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
  SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES 
  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designations of Series A Preferred Stock dated   May 17, 2013  , as amended, on August 1, 2016, the Company issued   132,320   shares of its Series A Preferred Stock as quarterly PIK dividends with respect to the   22,683,428   shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of the record date of July 15, 2016.

Each share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible at any time, at the holder's option, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of   $9.77586545  , subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. For additional information regarding the Series A Preferred Stock, see   Note 12 - Preferred Stock   of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this report.

  CERTIFICATIONS  
    
  I, Antoine J. Lafargue, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Magellan Petroleum Corporation;  
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

              4. 
    I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:
