    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     Basis of Presentation     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information (Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 270,   Interim Reporting  ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information necessary for a full presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal year as a whole. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of Integer Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively  Integer  or the  Company ) for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, certain components of equity, sales, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The   January 1, 2016   condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 1, 2016  . The Company utilizes a fifty-two, fifty-three week fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest December 31. The   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016   and   2015   each contained 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively, and ended on   September 30,   and   October 2,   respectively. 
  Effective June 30, 2016, the Company changed its name from Greatbatch, Inc. ( Greatbatch ) to Integer Holdings Corporation.  The new name represents the union of the Greatbatch Medical, Lake Region Medical and Electrochem brands. Integer, as in whole or complete, signifies the Company s more comprehensive products and service offerings, and a new dimension in its combined capabilities. 
  Nature of Operations         On October 27, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Lake Region Medical Holdings, Inc. ( Lake Region Medical ).  As a result, the Company has   three   reportable segments: Greatbatch Medical, QiG Group ( QiG ) and Lake Region Medical. On March 14, 2016, Integer completed the spin-off of a portion of its QiG segment through a tax-free distribution of all of the shares of its QiG Group, LLC subsidiary to the stockholders of Integer on a pro rata basis (the  Spin-off ).  See Note 2  Divestiture and Acquisition  for further description of these transactions.  As a result of the Lake Region Medical acquisition and the Spin-off, the Company is in the process of re-evaluating its internal management and financial reporting structure, which may change its product line and segment reporting in the future. This process is expected to be finalized in 2016. 
  Greatbatch Medical designs and manufactures products where the Company either owns the intellectual property or has unique manufacturing and assembly expertise.  These products include medical devices and components for the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, portable medical, vascular and energy markets among others.  
  The QiG segment focuses on the design and development of complete medical device systems and components for our customers. After completion of the Spin-off, the operations of QiG primarily consists of Centro de Construcci n de Cardioestimuladores del Uruguay ( CCC ), which was acquired in 2014. QiG seeks to assist customers in accelerating the velocity of innovation while delivering an optimized supply chain and critical cost efficiencies. The medical devices QiG designs and develops are full product solutions that utilize the medical technology expertise and capabilities residing within Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical. See Note 2  Divestiture and Acquisition  for further description of the Spin-off and how it impacted the QiG segment. 
  Lake Region Medical has operated as a segment of Integer since it was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2015. This segment specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of products across the medical component and device spectrum, primarily serving the cardio, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Lake Region Medical offers fully integrated outsourced manufacturing, regulatory and engineering services, contract manufacturing, finished device assembly services, original device development, and supply chain management to its customers.  
  The Company s customers include large multi-national original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and their affiliated subsidiaries.

    DIVESTITURE AND ACQUISITION 
     Spin-off of Nuvectra Corporation 
  On March 14, 2016, Integer completed the spin-off of a portion of its QiG segment through a tax-free distribution of all of the shares of its QiG Group, LLC subsidiary to the stockholders of Integer on a pro rata basis. Immediately prior to completion of the Spin-off, QiG Group, LLC was converted into a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and changed its name to Nuvectra Corporation ( Nuvectra ). On March 14, 2016, each of the Company s stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2016 (the  Record Date ) received one share of Nuvectra common stock for every   three   shares of Integer common stock held as of the Record Date.  Upon completion of the Spin-off, Nuvectra became an independent publicly traded company whose common stock is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol  NVTR.   
  The portion of the QiG segment spun-off consisted of QiG Group, LLC and its subsidiaries: (i) Algostim, LLC ( Algostim ), (ii) PelviStim LLC ( PelviStim ), and (iii) the Company s NeuroNexus Technologies ( NeuroNexus ) subsidiary. The operations of CCC and certain other existing QiG research and development capabilities were retained by the Company and not included as part of the Spin-off. As the Company continues to focus on the design and development of complete medical device systems and components, and more specifically on medical device systems and components in the neuromodulation market, the Spin-off was not considered a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the Spin-off is not presented as a discontinued operation in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of Nuvectra are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income through the date of the Spin-off.    
  In connection with the Spin-off, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company made a cash capital contribution of   $75 million   to Nuvectra and divested the following assets and liabilities (in thousands): 

For the first quarter of 2016, Nuvectra contributed a pre-tax loss of   $5.2 million   to the Company s results of operations.  Nuvectra contributed a pre-tax loss of   $7.0 million   and   $18.7 million  , respectively, to the Company s results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended October 2, 2015.  
  In connection with the Spin-off, on March 14, 2016, Integer entered into several agreements with Nuvectra that govern its post Spin-off relationship with Nuvectra, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement.   The Transition Services Agreement contains customary mutual indemnification provisions.   Amounts earned by Integer under the Transition Services Agreement were immaterial for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  Accounts Receivable, Net within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2016 includes   $7.0 million   due from Nuvectra for payments made by the Company on Nuvectra s behalf. 
  Acquisition of Lake Region Medical Holdings, Inc. 
  On October 27, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Lake Region Medical Holdings, Inc. for a total purchase price, including debt assumed, of approximately   $1.77 billion  . Lake Region Medical specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of products across the medical component and device spectrum primarily serving the cardio, vascular and advanced surgical markets.

2. 
    DIVESTITURE AND ACQUISITION (Continued) 
     The aggregate consideration paid to the stockholders and equity award holders of Lake Region Medical consisted of the following (in thousands):   

  The fair value of the Integer common stock issued as part of the consideration was determined based upon the closing stock price of Integer s shares as of the acquisition date.  The fair value of the Integer stock options issued as part of the consideration was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the acquisition date.  Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, the Company repaid all of the outstanding debt of Lake Region Medical of approximately   $1.0 billion  . The cash portion of the purchase price and the repayment of Lake Region Medical s debt was primarily funded through new senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of senior notes. See Note 6  Debt  for additional information regarding the Company s debt.   The Company believes that the combination of Greatbatch and Lake Region Medical brings together two highly complementary organizations that can provide a new level of industry leading capabilities and services to OEM customers while building value for stockholders.    Through this acquisition, the Company believes that it will be at the forefront of innovating technologies and products that help change the face of healthcare, providing its customers with a distinct advantage as they bring complete systems and solutions to market. In turn, Integer s customers will be able to accelerate patient access to life enhancing therapies.  The transaction is consistent with Integer's strategy of achieving profitable growth and continuous improvement to drive margin expansion.  
  This transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the cost of the acquisition was allocated to the Lake Region Medical assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the closing date of the acquisition, with the amount exceeding the fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Measurement-period adjustments made during the first nine months of 2016 were primarily to goodwill (  $1.1 million  ) and deferred tax liabilities (  $2.6 million  ), and did not impact the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The measurement-period for this acquisition is now closed and no further purchase price adjustments will be made. 
  The following table summarizes the allocation of the Lake Region Medical purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):

    DIVESTITURE AND ACQUISITION (Continued) 
     The fair values of the assets acquired were determined using one of three valuation approaches: market, income or cost. The selection of a particular method for a given asset depended on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset, among other considerations. 
  The market approach estimates the value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets. The income approach estimates the value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. The projected cash flows were discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the asset and the time value of money. The projected cash flows for each asset considered multiple factors from the perspective of a marketplace participant including revenue projections from existing customers, attrition trends, technology life-cycle assumptions, marginal tax rates and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins. The cost approach estimates the value for a subject asset based on the cost to replace the asset and reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation or obsolescence, with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated. These fair value measurement approaches are based on significant unobservable inputs, including management estimates and assumptions. 
  Current Assets and Liabilities     The fair value of current assets and liabilities, excluding inventory, was assumed to approximate their carrying value as of the acquisition date due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 
  The fair value of in-process and finished goods inventory acquired was estimated by applying a version of the market approach called the comparable sales method. This approach estimates the fair value of the assets by calculating the potential revenue generated from selling the inventory and subtracting from it the costs related to the completion and sale of that inventory and a reasonable profit allowance. Based upon this methodology, the Company recorded the inventory acquired at fair value resulting in an increase in inventory of   $23.0 million  . This step-up in the fair value of inventory was amortized as the inventory to which the step-up relates was sold and was fully amortized as of January 1, 2016.  
  Property, Plant and Equipment     The fair value of property, plant   equipment acquired was estimated by applying the cost approach for personal property, buildings and building improvements and the market approach for land.  The cost approach was applied by developing a replacement cost and adjusting for depreciation and obsolescence. The value of the land acquired was derived from market prices for comparable properties. 
  Intangible Assets     The purchase price was allocated to intangible assets as follows (dollars in thousands):   

  The weighted average amortization period is less than the estimated useful life, as the Company is using an accelerated amortization method, which approximates the distribution of cash flows used to fair value those intangible assets. 
  Technology     Technology consists of technical processes, patented and unpatented technology, manufacturing know-how, trade secrets and the understanding with respect to products or processes that have been developed by Lake Region Medical and that will be leveraged in current and future products. The fair value of technology acquired was determined utilizing the relief from royalty method, a form of the income approach, with a royalty rate that ranged from   0.5%   to   7%  . The estimated useful life of the technology is based upon management s estimate of the product life cycle associated with the technology before it will be replaced by new technologies.

    DIVESTITURE AND ACQUISITION (Continued) 
     Customer Lists     Customer lists represent the estimated fair value of non-contractual customer relationships Lake Region Medical had as of the acquisition date. The primary customers of Lake Region Medical are large OEMs in various geographic locations around the world. These relationships were valued separately from goodwill at the amount that an independent third party would be willing to pay for these relationships. The fair value of customer lists was determined using the multi-period excess-earnings method, a form of the income approach. The estimated useful life of the existing customer base was based upon the historical customer annual attrition rate of   5%  , as well as management s understanding of the industry and product life cycles. 
  Trademarks and Tradenames     Trademarks and tradenames represent the estimated fair value of Lake Region Medical s corporate and product names. These tradenames were valued separately from goodwill at the amount that an independent third party would be willing to pay for use of these names. The fair value of the trademarks and tradenames was determined by utilizing the relief from royalty method, a form of the income approach, with a royalty rate that ranged from   0.25%   to   1%  . Trademarks and tradenames were assumed to have an indefinite useful life based upon the significant value the Lake Region Medical name has with OEMs in the medical component and device industries, their long history of being an industry leader and producing quality and innovative components, and given management s current intention of using this tradename indefinitely, which was assumed to be consistent with what a reasonable market participant would also assume. 
  Goodwill     The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. Various factors contributed to the establishment of goodwill, including the value of Lake Region Medical s highly trained assembled work force and management team, the incremental value resulting from Lake Region Medical s capabilities and services to OEMs, enhanced synergies, and the expected revenue growth over time that is attributable to increased market penetration from future products and customers. The goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition was allocated to the Lake Region Medical segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. 
  Long-term Debt     The fair value of long-term debt was assumed to be equal to what was paid by Integer at the time of closing of the acquisition in order to retire the debt, including prepayment penalties and fees. 
  Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income 
  The operating results of Lake Region Medical have been included in the Company s Lake Region Medical segment from the date of acquisition.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Lake Region Medical added $  607.1 million   to the Company s revenue and decreased the Company s net loss by approximately $  27.9 million  .

  Senior Secured Credit Facilities   - In connection with the Lake Region Medical acquisition, on October 27, 2015, the Company replaced its existing credit facility with new senior secured credit facilities (the  Senior Secured Credit Facilities ) consisting of (i) a   $200 million   revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), (ii) a   $375 million   term loan A facility (the  TLA Facility ), and (iii) a   $1,025 million   term loan B facility (the  TLB Facility ). The TLA Facility and TLB Facility are collectively referred to as the  Term Loan Facilities.  The TLB facility was issued at a   1%   discount. 
  Term Loan Facilities 
  The TLA Facility and TLB Facility mature on   October 27, 2021   and   October 27, 2022  , respectively. Interest rates on the TLA Facility, as well as the Revolving Credit Facility, are at the Company s option, either at: (i) the prime rate plus the applicable margin, which will range between   0.75%   and   2.25%  , based on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement or (ii) the applicable LIBOR rate plus the applicable margin, which will range between   1.75%   and   3.25%  , based on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio. Interest rates on the TLB Facility are, at the Company s option, either at: (i) the prime rate plus   3.25%   or (ii) the applicable LIBOR rate plus   4.25%  , with LIBOR subject to a   1.00%   floor.  
  Subject to certain conditions,   one   or more incremental term loan facilities may be added to the Term Loan Facilities so long as, on a pro forma basis, the Company s first lien net leverage ratio does not exceed   4.25  :1.00. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the TLB Facility was approximately   $1,005 million  , based on quoted market prices for the debt, recent sales prices for the debt and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency, among other factors, and is classified as Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The par amount of the TLA Facility approximated its fair value as of   September 30, 2016   based upon the debt being variable rate in nature.

     Revolving Credit Facility 
  The Revolving Credit Facility matures on   October 27, 2020  . The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a   $15 million   sublimit for swingline loans and a   $25 million   sublimit for standby letters of credit. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which will range between   0.175%   and   0.25%  , depending on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $50 million   of outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and an available borrowing capacity of   $141.1 million   after giving effect to   $8.9 million   of outstanding standby letters of credit.      
  Subject to certain conditions, commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased through an incremental revolving facility so long as, on a pro forma basis, the Company s first lien net leverage ratio does not exceed   4.25  :1.00. 
  Covenants 
  The Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility contain covenants requiring (A) a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio of   6.50  :1.00, subject to step downs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to interest expense of not less than   3.00  :1.00. The TLB Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. Based upon the Company s current expectations for its 2016 adjusted EBITDA, there is a potential that it will not be able to meet its minimum interest coverage ratio at year-end 2016. The Company is working with the administrative agent under its Senior Secured Credit Facilities to obtain an amendment or waiver of the financial covenants before year-end.  
  The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain negative covenants that restrict the Company s ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) create certain liens; (iii) consolidate or merge; (iv) sell assets, including capital stock of the Company s subsidiaries; (v) engage in transactions with the Company s affiliates; (vi) create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts from the Company s restricted subsidiaries; (vii) pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock; (viii) pay, prepay, repurchase or retire certain subordinated indebtedness; (ix) make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions; (x) make certain amendments or modifications to the organizational documents of the Company or its subsidiaries or the documentation governing other senior indebtedness of the Company; and (xi) change the Company s type of business. These negative covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions that are described in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all negative covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.   
  The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide for customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities become immediately due and payable. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by Integer Holdings Corporation, as a parent guarantor, and all of the Company s present and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than Greatbatch Ltd. (which is the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), non-wholly owned joint ventures, and certain other excluded subsidiaries). The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first priority security interest in; i) the present and future shares of capital stock of (or other ownership or profit interests in) Greatbatch Ltd. and each guarantor (except Integer Holdings Corporation); ii) sixty-six percent (  66%  ) of all present and future shares of voting capital stock of each specified first-tier foreign subsidiary; iii) substantially all of the Company s, Greatbatch Ltd. s and each other guarantor s other personal property; and iv) all proceeds and products of the property and assets of the Company, Greatbatch Ltd. and the other guarantors.

On or after November 1, 2018, the Company may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, pursuant to a customary schedule of declining redemption prices.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was approximately   $351 million  , based on quoted market prices of these Senior Notes, recent sales prices for the Senior Notes and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency, among other factors, and is classified as Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.

Interest Rate Swaps     From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on its outstanding variable rate debt.  In July 2016, the Company entered into a   one  -year   $250 million   interest rate swap with an effective date of July 27, 2016.  The Company entered into the swap to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on the outstanding variable rate debt, which is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate. The variable rate received on the interest rate swap and the variable rate paid on the outstanding debt will have the same rate of interest, excluding the credit spread, and will reset and pay interest on the same day. The swap is being accounted for as a cash flow hedge. 
  In June 2016, the Company entered into a   three  -year   $200 million   interest rate swap with an effective date of June 27, 2017. The Company entered into the swap to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on the outstanding variable rate debt, which is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.

    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
     At the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 24, 2016, the Company s stockholders approved the Company s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ).  The 2016 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and stock bonuses to employees, non-employee directors, consultants, and service providers. The 2016 Plan supplements the Company s existing 2009 and 2011 Stock Incentive Plans, as amended. 
  In connection with the Spin-off, under the provisions of the Company s existing 2009 and 2011 stock incentive plans, employee stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock unit awards were adjusted to preserve the fair value of the awards immediately before and after the Spin-off.  As such, the Company did not record any modification expense related to the conversion of the awards. Certain awards granted to employees who transferred to Nuvectra in connection with the Spin-off were canceled.  As required, the Company accelerated the remaining expense related to these canceled awards of   $0.5 million   during the first quarter of 2016, which was classified as Other Operating Expenses, Net.  The stock awards held as of March 14, 2016 were modified as follows: 
             
    Stock options  : Holders of the Company s stock option awards continued to hold stock options to purchase the same number of shares of Integer common stock at an adjusted exercise price and one new Nuvectra stock option for every   three   Integer stock options held as of the Record Date, which, in the aggregate, preserved the fair value of the overall awards granted. The adjusted exercise price for Integer stock options was equal to approximately   93%   of the original exercise price.  The stock option awards will continue to vest over their original vesting period.  
                
    Restricted stock and restricted stock units  : Holders of the Company s restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards received one new share of Nuvectra restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for every three Integer restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards held as of the Record Date.  Integer restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest in accordance with their original performance metrics and over their original vesting period.

The income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors, including discrete items, changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws and foreign tax holidays, business reorganizations, settlements with taxing authorities and foreign currency fluctuations.    The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was   41.3%   and   20.4%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 includes the impact of a   $1.6 million   (  $2.9 million   for the third quarter of 2016) of net discrete tax benefits related to Lake Region Medical and Spin-off transaction costs. For fiscal year 2016, the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately (30%). The tax benefit for the third quarter and expected tax benefit for full year 2016 is due to these discrete tax items, as well as Company having projected losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions and income in lower tax rate jurisdictions.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance of unrecognized tax benefits is approximately   $9.8 million  . It is reasonably possible that a reduction of up to   $0.1 million   of the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months as a result of potential audit settlements. Approximately   $9.0 million   of the balance of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate, net of federal benefit on state issues, if recognized.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
     Litigation         In April 2013, the Company commenced an action against AVX Corporation and AVX Filters Corporation (collectively  AVX ) alleging that AVX had infringed on the Company s patents by manufacturing and selling filtered feedthrough assemblies used in implantable pacemakers and cardioverter defibrillators that incorporate the Company s patented technology. On January 26, 2016, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware returned a verdict finding that AVX infringed on   two   Integer patents and awarded Integer   $37.5 million   in damages. The finding is subject to post-trial proceedings, including a possible appeal by AVX. The Company has recorded   no   gains in connection with this litigation as no cash has been received. 
  The Company is a party to various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business. The Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of any other pending legal actions will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. As such, there can be no assurance that any pending legal action, which the Company currently believes to be immaterial, will not become material in the future. 
  Environmental Matters       The Company s Collegeville, PA facility, which was acquired as part of the Lake Region Medical acquisition, is subject to two administrative consent orders entered into with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ), which require ongoing groundwater treatment and monitoring at the site as a result of historic leaks from underground storage tanks. Upon approval by the EPA of the Company s proposed post remediation care plan, which requires a continuation of the groundwater treatment and monitoring process at the site, the Company expects that the consent orders will be terminated. The Company expects a decision from the EPA on whether the Company s post remediation care plan has been approved during the fourth quarter of 2016 or early 2017. The groundwater treatment process at the Collegeville facility consists of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the performance of annual sampling of a defined set of groundwater wells as a means to monitor containment within approved boundaries. The Company does not expect this environmental matter will have a material effect on its condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) 
     In January 2015, Lake Region Medical was notified by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ( NJDEP ) of the NJDEP s intent to revoke a no further action determination made by the NJDEP in favor of Lake Region Medical in 2002 pertaining to a property on which a subsidiary of Lake Region Medical operated a manufacturing facility in South Plainfield, New Jersey beginning in 1971. Lake Region Medical sold the property in 2004 and vacated the facility in 2007. In response to the NJDEP s notice, the Company further investigated the matter and submitted a technical report to the NJDEP in August of 2015 that concluded that the NJDEP s notice of intent to revoke was unwarranted. After reviewing the Company s technical report, the NJDEP issued a draft response in May 2016, stating that the NJDEP would not revoke the no further action determination at that time, but would require some additional site investigation to support the Company s conclusion. The Company is cooperating with the NJDEP and has met with NJDEP representatives to discuss the appropriate scope of the requested additional investigation.  The Company does not expect this environmental matter will have a material effect on its condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  As of September 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016, there was   $1.1 million   recorded in Other Long-Term Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in connection with these environmental matters. 
  Product Warranties         The Company generally warrants that its products will meet customer specifications and will be free from defects in materials and workmanship.   The Company does not expect future product warranty claims will have a material effect on its condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that any future customer complaints or negative regulatory actions regarding the Company s products, which the Company currently believes to be immaterial, does not become material in the future.

  Foreign Currency Contracts       From time to time, the Company enters into forward contracts to purchase Mexican pesos in order to hedge the risk of peso-denominated payments associated with operations at its facilities in Mexico  . In connection with the Lake Region Medical acquisition, the Company terminated its outstanding forward contracts resulting in a   $2.4 million   payment to the foreign currency contract counter-party during the fourth quarter of 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a   $0.3 million   loss recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to these contracts, which will be amortized to Cost of Sales as the inventory, which the contracts were hedging the cash flows to produce, is sold.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) 
     Self-Insurance Liabilities         As of   September 30, 2016  , and at various times in the past, the Company self-funded its workers' compensation and employee medical expenses. The Company has established reserves to cover these self-insured liabilities and also maintains stop-loss insurance to limit its exposures under these programs.  Claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of reported claims, including adverse development of reported claims, as well as estimates of incurred but not reported claims. Claims incurred but not reported are estimated based on the Company s historical experience, which is continually monitored, and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances.  The Company s actual experience may be different than its estimates, sometimes significantly. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change. Insurance and claims expense will vary from period to period based on the severity and frequency of claims incurred in a given period. The Company s self-insurance reserves totaled   $6.7 million   and   $7.9 million   as of September 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016, respectively. These accruals are recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other Long-Term Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
     Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Fair value measurement standards apply to certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (each reporting period). For the Company, these financial assets and liabilities include its derivative instruments. The Company does not have any nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  Foreign Currency Contracts     The fair value of foreign currency contracts were determined through the use of cash flow models that utilize observable market data inputs to estimate fair value. These observable market data inputs included foreign exchange rate and credit spread curves. In addition, the Company received fair value estimates from the foreign currency contract counterparties to verify the reasonableness of the Company s estimates. The Company s foreign currency contracts are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company s foreign currency contracts will be realized as Cost of Sales as the inventory, which the contracts are hedging the cash flows to produce, is sold, of which approximately   $1.7 million   is expected to be realized within the next twelve months. 
  Interest Rate Swaps     The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were determined through the use of a cash flow model that utilizes observable market data inputs. These observable market data inputs include LIBOR, swap rates, and credit spread curves. In addition, the Company received a fair value estimate from the interest rate swaps counterparty to verify the reasonableness of the Company s estimate. This fair value calculation was categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps will be realized as Interest Expense as interest on the corresponding borrowings is accrued. 
  The following table provides information regarding assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):   

  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Fair value standards also apply to certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. Refer to Note 6  Debt  for further discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes. A summary of the valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis is as follows: 
  Long-lived Assets     The Company reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for potential impairment whenever certain indicators are present such as: a significant decrease in the market price of the asset or asset group; a significant change in the extent or manner in which the long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the long-lived asset or asset group, including an action or assessment by a regulator; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction; a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset or asset group; or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent.

    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) 
     Potential recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to its related total future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the asset or asset group is considered to be impaired. Impairment is measured by comparing the asset or asset group s carrying amount to its fair value. When it is determined that useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, and no impairment is present, the rate of depreciation is accelerated in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives. The Company recorded   $1.0 million   of impairment charges related to its long-lived assets, which is included in Other Operating Expenses, Net during the first   nine   months of   2016  . The Company did   no  t record any impairment charges related to its long-lived assets during the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
  Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets     Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded are not amortized but are periodically tested for impairment. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment on the last day of each fiscal year, or more frequently if certain events occur as described above. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not greater than its carrying amount. This qualitative assessment is referred to as a  step zero      approach. If, based on the review of the qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, the required two-step impairment test can be bypassed. If the Company does not perform a step zero assessment or if the fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than its carrying value, the Company must perform a two-step impairment test, and calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If, based upon the two-step impairment test, it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Under the two-step approach, fair values for reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flows and market multiples.  
  Other indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment on the last day of each fiscal year, or more frequently if certain events occur as described above, by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. The fair value is determined by using the income approach.  
  The Company did not record any impairment charges related to its indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, during the first   nine   months of   2016   or   2015  , respectively. See Note 5  Intangible Assets  for additional information on the Company s intangible assets. 
  Cost and Equity Method Investments     The Company holds investments in equity and other securities that are accounted for as either cost or equity method investments, which are classified as Other Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total carrying value of these investments is reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company s investment may not be recoverable. The fair value of cost or equity method investments is not adjusted if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a material effect on the fair value of the investments. Gains and losses realized on cost and equity method investments are recorded in Other Expense (Income), Net, unless separately stated. The aggregate recorded amount of cost and equity method investments at   September 30, 2016   and January 1, 2016 was   $24.4 million   and   $20.6 million  , respectively. The Company s equity method investment is in a Chinese venture capital fund focused on investing in life sciences companies. This fund accounts for its investments at fair value with the unrealized change in fair value of these investments recorded as income or loss to the fund in the period of change. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   7.0%   of this fund. 
  During the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , the Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to its cost method investments. The fair value of these investments is primarily determined by reference to recent sales data of similar shares to independent parties in an inactive market. This fair value calculation is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. During the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , the Company recognized a net gain on cost and equity method investments of   $0.9 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized   $4.6 million   of income from its equity method investment and received a   $3.4 million   cash distribution, which was classified as a cash flow from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as it represented a return on investment.

    IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
       In the normal course of business, management evaluates all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ), or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Based upon this review, except as noted below, management does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements, which have not already been adopted, to have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Recently Adopted 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. This update requires acquiring companies to recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance in this ASU became effective for the Company on January 2, 2016. See Note 2  Divestiture and Acquisition  for further description of the measurement-period adjustments made and the Company s acquisition. 
    Not Yet Adopted 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments: A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.  ASU 2016-15 makes targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The areas specifically addressed include debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, the settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, cash premiums paid for and proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees and cash receipts from payments on transferor s beneficial interest on securitized trade receivables. Additionally, the amendment states that, in the absence of other prevailing guidance, cash receipts and payments that have characteristics of more than one class of cash flows should have each separately identifiable source or use of cash presented within the most predominant class of cash flows based on the nature of the underlying cash flows. These amendments are effective for the Company in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  which amends the guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost and available-for-sale debt securities.  For assets held at amortized cost, the ASU eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and requires an entity to reflect a current estimate of all expected credit losses, such that the net amount expected to be collected is presented.  For available-for-sale debt securities, the ASU requires credit losses to be presented as an allowance versus a write-down.  These amendments are effective for the Company in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  If an entity early adopts in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period and the entity must adopt all of the amendments from ASU 2016-09 in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

    IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (Continued) 
     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which requires companies to recognize all leases as assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. This ASU retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases, and the classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the current accounting literature. As a result, the effect of leases on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and a consolidated statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous GAAP.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  This ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; requires entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; and requires entities to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as  own credit ) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. This ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the own credit provision is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this ASU on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   The core principle behind ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering goods and services.  In August 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral to the effective date to be adopted by all public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with earlier application permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  In March, April and May of 2016, respectively, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, ASU No. 2016-10, which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing and ASU No. 2016-12, which provides improvements to the guidance on collectability, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts at transition, a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. These amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of adopting these ASU s and the methods of adoption; however, given the scope of the new standard, the Company is currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact or which method of adoption will be elected.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Our Business 
  Integer Holdings Corporation (NYSE: ITGR) is one of the largest medical device outsource ( MDO ) manufacturers in the world serving the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular, advanced surgical, and power solutions markets. We provide innovative, high quality medical technologies that seek to enhance the lives of patients worldwide. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Lake Region Medical Holdings, Inc. ( Lake Region Medical ). As a result, we have three reportable segments: Greatbatch Medical, QiG Group ( QiG ), and Lake Region Medical. In March 2016, we spun-off of a portion of our QiG segment (the  Spin-off ), which is now an independent publicly traded company known as Nuvectra Corporation ( Nuvectra ).  As a result of the Lake Region Medical acquisition and the Spin-off, we are in the process of re-evaluating our internal management and financial reporting structure, which may change our product line and segment reporting in the future. This process is expected to be finalized in 2016. See Note 2  Divestiture and Acquisition  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for further description of these transactions and Note 15  Business Segment, Geographic and Concentration Risk Information  for further information on our product lines and business segments. 
  Effective June 30, 2016, we changed our name from Greatbatch, Inc. ( Greatbatch ) to Integer Holdings Corporation. The new name represents the union of the Greatbatch Medical, Lake Region Medical and Electrochem brands. Integer, meaning whole or complete, signifies our more comprehensive products and service offerings, and a new dimension in our combined capabilities.  When used in this report, the terms  Integer,   we,   us,   our  and the  Company  mean Integer Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
  The Greatbatch Medical segment designs and manufactures products where we either own the intellectual property or have unique manufacturing and assembly expertise. These products include medical devices and components for the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, portable medical, vascular and energy markets among others. The Greatbatch Medical segment also offers value-added assembly and design engineering services for medical devices that utilize its component products. 
  The QiG segment focuses on the design and development of complete medical device systems and components for our customers. After completion of the Spin-off, the operations of QiG primarily consists of Centro de Construcci n de Cardioestimuladores del Uruguay ( CCC ), which was acquired in 2014. QiG seeks to assist customers in accelerating the velocity of innovation while delivering an optimized supply chain and critical cost efficiencies. The medical devices QiG designs and develops are full product solutions that utilize the medical technology expertise and capabilities residing within Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical. QiG revenue consists primarily of sales of various medical device products such as implantable pulse generators, programmer systems, battery chargers, patient wands and leads to medical device companies. Once the medical devices developed by QiG reaches significant production levels, the responsibility for manufacturing these products may be transferred to Greatbatch Medical. 
  The Lake Region Medical segment specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of products across the medical component and device spectrum, primarily serving the cardio, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Lake Region Medical offers fully integrated outsourced manufacturing, regulatory and engineering services, contract manufacturing, finished device assembly services, original device development, and supply chain management.  
  Our Acquisitions 
  On October 27, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Lake Region Medical, headquartered in Wilmington, MA. Lake Region Medical is a manufacturer of interventional and diagnostic wire-formed medical devices and components specializing in minimally invasive devices for cardiovascular, endovascular, and neurovascular applications. This acquisition has added scale and diversity to our operations, which has enhanced customer access and experience by providing a more comprehensive portfolio of technologies. The operating results of Lake Region Medical are included in our Lake Region Medical segment from the date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price of Lake Region Medical including debt assumed was $1.77 billion, which was funded primarily through new senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of senior notes. Total assets acquired from Lake Region Medical were $2.1 billion. Total liabilities assumed from Lake Region Medical were $1.3 billion. For the first nine months of 2016, Lake Region Medical added approximately $607.1 million to our revenue and decreased our net loss by approximately $27.9 million. 
  With the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, our main strategic priorities over the next two to three years include, among others, the integration of both legacy companies, driving integration synergies, and the paying down our outstanding debt.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

As previously mentioned, we expect to finalize the process of re-evaluating our internal management and financial reporting structure during 2016. As a result of this process, we may change our product line and/or segment reporting. If we change our segment reporting, we will assess goodwill for impairment and   re-allocate our goodwill to the new   reporting units based on their relative fair value at that time. While the results of our annual impairment reviews have historically not indicated impairment, impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results and cash flows, discount rates based on the Company s weighted average cost of capital, the Company s stock price, revenue and adjusted EBITDA multiples, and appropriate benchmark peer companies. Assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions, and future sales and earnings forecasts, which incorporate projected future operating efficiencies. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment charges. Any impairment charges that we record in the future could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. A detailed discussion of our impairment testing is included in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Our Critical Accounting Estimates  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Despite our lower than expected revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and reduction in our stock price during 2016, we believe that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets was indicated for any of our reporting units as of September 30, 2016. This determination was based upon management s evaluation, which took into consideration our current and expected results to date, current revenue and adjusted EBITDA multiples, and the significant cushion that existed as of the last goodwill impairment analysis. However, there can be no assurances that our goodwill and/or intangible assets will not be impaired in future periods if future operating results and cash flows continue to deteriorate, are less than our projections, and/or we continue to have a sustained decrease in our stock price. 
  Our Customers 
  Our products are designed to provide reliable, long-lasting solutions that meet the evolving requirements and needs of our customers. The nature and extent of our selling relationships with each customer are different in terms of breadth of products purchased, purchased product volumes, length of contractual commitment, ordering patterns, inventory management, and selling prices. 
  Our Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical customers include large multinational original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and their subsidiaries, such as Abbott Laboratories, Biotronik, Boehringer Ingelheim, Boston Scientific, Halliburton Company, Johnson   Johnson, LivaNova, Medtronic, Nevro Corp., Philips Healthcare, Smith   Nephew, St. Jude Medical, Stryker, and Zimmer Biomet. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Johnson   Johnson, Medtronic, and St. Jude Medical collectively accounted for   46%   of our total sales. QiG customers include various early stage medical device companies. 
   
  Financial Overview 
  For the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, sales increased $199.9 million, or 136%, and $544.3 million, or 113%, respectively, in comparison to the prior year periods. Included in these periods is $203.9 million and $607.1 million of sales contributed by Lake Region Medical, respectively. Sales for the first nine months of 2016 also include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced Greatbatch Medical sales by approximately $1 million in comparison to the prior year due to the strengthening dollar versus the Euro. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not materially impact Greatbatch Medical sales for the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of these items, our organic constant currency sales decreased 4% and 13% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 in comparison to the prior year, respectively. These decreases were primarily due to 1) the reduction of shipments in a limited number of cardiac rhythm management ( CRM ) customer programs; 2) the decline in energy market-driven revenue; and 3) a decline due to contractual price reductions. These decreases were partially offset by growth in sales to our neuromodulation customers during the first half of 2016. Lake Region Medical revenues were consistent with the prior year for the quarter and year-to-date periods.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information 
  We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  Additionally, we consistently report and discuss in our earnings releases and investor presentations adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ), adjusted EBITDA and organic constant currency sales growth rates. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share consist of GAAP amounts adjusted for the following to the extent occurring during the period: (i) acquisition-related charges, (ii) amortization of intangible assets, (iii) facility consolidation, optimization, manufacturing transfer and system integration charges, (iv) asset write-down and disposition charges, (v) charges in connection with corporate realignments or a reduction in force, (vi) certain litigation expenses, charges and gains, (vii) unusual or infrequently occurring items, (viii) gain/loss on cost and equity method investments, (ix) the income tax (benefit) related to these adjustments and (x) certain tax items related to the Federal research and development tax credit which are outside the normal benefit received for the period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income (loss) plus (i) the same adjustments as listed above except for items (ix), and (x), (ii) GAAP stock-based compensation, interest expense, and depreciation, (iii) GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes and (iv) cash gains received from cost and equity method investments during the period. To calculate organic constant currency sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures of product lines on sales growth rates, we convert current period sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using the previous periods  foreign currency exchange rates and exclude the amount of sales acquired/divested during the period from the current/previous period amounts, respectively. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and organic constant currency sales growth rates provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, incentive compensation targets for our executives and associates are based upon these adjusted measures.  
  A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) to adjusted amounts is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

(a) 
    The difference between pre-tax and net income (loss) amounts is the estimated tax impact related to the respective adjustment. Net income amounts are computed using a 35% U.S., Mexico, Germany, and France statutory tax rate, a 0% Swiss tax rate, a 20% Netherlands statutory tax rate, a 25% Uruguay statutory tax rate, and a 12.5% Ireland statutory tax rate. Expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes (i.e. permanent tax differences) are added back at 100%. 
              (b) 
    In 2013, we filed suit against AVX Corporation alleging they were infringing our intellectual property. Given the complexity and significant costs incurred pursuing this litigation, we are excluding these litigation expenses from adjusted amounts. This matter proceeded to trial during the first quarter of 2016 and a federal jury awarded the Company $37.5 million in damages. To date, no gains have been recognized in connection with this litigation.  
              (c) 
    During 2016 and 2015, we incurred costs primarily related to the transfer of our Beaverton, OR portable medical and Plymouth, MN vascular manufacturing operations to Tijuana, Mexico. Additionally, with the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, 2016 costs also include expenses incurred in connection with the closure of Lake Region Medical s Arvada, CO, site and the consolidation of its two Galway, Ireland sites, which was initiated by Lake Region Medical in 2014. 
              (d) 
    During 2016 and 2015, we incurred acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, which was acquired in October 2015. During 2015, we incurred costs related to the integration of CCC Medical Devices, which was acquired in August 2014. 
              (e) 
    Costs consist primarily of legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the Spin-off, which was completed in March 2016. 
              (f) 
    During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded transaction costs (i.e. debt commitment fees, interest rate swap termination costs) in connection with our acquisition of Lake Region Medical. 
              (g) 
    Tax adjustments for the 2016 periods include a discrete tax benefit related to certain transaction costs of the Lake Region Medical acquisition and the Spin-off. For the 2015 periods, tax adjustments consist of the 2015 Federal R D tax credit, which was enacted during the fourth quarter of 2015 and has been permanently reinstated. Amounts assume that the tax credit was effective at the beginning of the year for 2015. 
              (h) 
    The per share data in this table have been rounded to the nearest $0.01 and therefore may not sum to the total. 
              (i) 
    Adjusted diluted weighted average shares for the year-to-date 2016 period includes 455,000 of potentially dilutive shares not included in the computation of diluted weighted average common shares for GAAP diluted EPS purposes because their effect would have been anti-dilutive given our net loss during that period.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

GAAP diluted EPS for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 was income of $0.37 per share and a loss of $0.06 per share, respectively, compared to $0.00 and income of $0.66 per share, respectively for the comparable 2015 periods. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 and $1.72 per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, increased 43% and decreased 12%, respectively, in comparison to the prior year periods. The primary drivers behind these variances are as follows:  
             
    GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter and nine month periods of 2016 includes $29.9 million and $78.5 million, respectively, of operating income added from Lake Region Medical; 
                
    The organic constant currency decline in sales as discussed above; 
                
    A $7.0 million and $13.5 million increase in operating income (primarily lower SG A and RD E Costs) for the quarter and nine month period comparisons, respectively, due to the Spin-off; 
                
    The third quarter and nine month periods of 2016 includes the benefit of approximately $11 million and $25 million, respectively, of synergies realized in connection with our acquisition of Lake Region Medical; 
                
    A $22.0 million and $75.2 million increase in interest expense for the third quarter and nine month period comparisons, respectively, due to the debt incurred in connection with the Lake Region Medical acquisition in October 2015; 
                
    The third quarter and nine month period 2016 GAAP effective tax rate includes $2.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of net discrete tax benefits related to Lake Region Medical and Spin-off transaction costs, which are added back for adjusted diluted EPS purposes; 
                
    The addition of 5 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the Lake Region Medical acquisition; and  
                
    The decrease in GAAP diluted EPS for the nine month period was also attributable to a $20.6 million increase in acquisition, integration and Spin-off related expenses over the comparable 2015 period, which are included in GAAP results, but are excluded from adjusted amounts. 
     A reconciliation of net income (loss) as reported (GAAP) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

The primary driver behind the increases in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 versus the comparable 2015 periods was approximately $48 million and $136 million, respectively, of adjusted EBITDA added from Lake Region Medical, partially offset by lower sales and gross profit from legacy Greatbatch Medical during the same periods as discussed above. Additionally, the Spin-off of Nuvectra accounted for approximately $7 million and $13 million of the increase in our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and nine month periods, respectively.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

As of the end of the 2016 third quarter, we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our senior secured credit facilities. We are actively monitoring our financial covenant compliance and based upon our current expectations for our 2016 adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, there is a potential that we will not be able to meet our minimum interest coverage ratio at year-end 2016. We are working with the administrative agent under the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to obtain an amendment or waiver of our financial covenants before year-end. If a waiver or amendment cannot be obtained from our lenders, an event of default may occur. An event of default under our debt agreements may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness. As a result, management believes that compliance with these covenants is material to us. See the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of this Item for further discussion on our debt covenants and liquidity. 
   
  Financial Outlook 
  Our current full-year 2016 outlook is as follows (in millions, except for per share amounts): 

Adjusted Comparable Basis net income and EPS for 2016 are expected to consist of GAAP net income and EPS, excluding items such as intangible amortization (approximately $40 million), IP related litigation costs, and consolidation, acquisition, integration, and asset disposition/write-down charges totaling approximately $105 million. The after-tax impact of these items is estimated to be approximately $70 million, or approximately $2.25 per diluted share. Additionally, our comparable basis revenue, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA guidance excludes the results of Nuvectra prior to its spin-off on March 14, 2016, of $1.2 million, a tax benefit of $1.4 million, a loss of $2.6 million, a loss of $0.08 per share, and $3.7 million of adjusted EBITDA, respectively. 
  With respect to our expectations under  Financial Outlook  above, for adjusted comparable basis net income, adjusted comparable basis earnings per diluted share, and adjusted comparable basis EBITDA, except as described above, further reconciliations by line item to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and visibility with respect to charges excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. 
   
  Our CEO s View 
  Our third quarter results demonstrate that the steps we have taken are beginning to stabilize our business. Our focus on reducing costs, improving working capital, and business process optimization is progressing well and has allowed us to stem the revenue and adjusted EBITDA declines we saw during the first half of the year. Our outlook for the remainder of the year further demonstrates this business stabilization. With that said, we acknowledge that we have work to do in order to further stabilize our business and bring us back to predictable revenue growth.  
  We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand and grow our business. Today, a relatively low percentage of medical device manufacturing is outsourced, and the market is highly fragmented. Our competencies in manufacturing, core technologies, quality control, and operational excellence will allow our customers to leverage significant benefits provided by Integer. As we work closely with our customers, and deepen those relationships, we feel we have established a better line of sight to our customer s programs, demand plans and growth objectives, which will help us better manage our business and product line forecasts. Integer s value proposition remains intact and we believe we are well-positioned within the medical technology market, with a broad suite of technologies, capabilities and product offerings to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to our customers in order to enrich the lives of patients worldwide.

Cost Savings and Consolidation Efforts 
  In   2016   and   2015  , we recorded charges in other operating expenses, net related to various cost savings and consolidation initiatives. These initiatives were undertaken to improve our operational efficiencies and profitability, the most significant of which are as follows (dollars in millions):   

           (a) 
    Represents the annual benefit to our operating income expected to be realized from these initiatives through cost savings and/or increased capacity. These benefits will be phased in over time as the various initiatives are completed, and some of which are already included in our current period results. 
     See Note 9  Other Operating Expenses, Net  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional information about the timing, cash flow impact and amount of future expenditures for these initiatives. We continually evaluate our operating structure in order to maximize efficiencies and drive margin expansion. Future charges are expected to be incurred as a result of the consolidation and optimization of the combined Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical businesses. We seek to create an optimized manufacturing footprint, leveraging our increased scale and product capabilities while also supporting the needs of our customers. Our efforts will include: 
             
    potential manufacturing consolidations; 
                
    continuous improvement; 
                
    productivity initiatives; 
                
    direct material and indirect expense savings opportunities; and 
                
    the establishment of centers of excellence around the world.  
     In September 2016, we announced the planned closure and transfer of product lines of our Clarence, NY facility. We will be transferring these machined component product lines to other Integer locations in the U.S.  The project is expected to take 12 to 18 months and will generate estimated annual synergies of approximately $4 million starting in 2018.  
  For 2016, we expect to achieve between $30 million to $35 million in net synergies in connection with our acquisition of Lake Region Medical, which exceeds our $25 million annual net synergies target. These net synergies are expected to increase to $60 million by 2018.  We expect the investment necessary to achieve these synergies to be approximately $60 million to $75 million, which consists of $20 million to $25 million in capital expenditures and $40 million to $50 million of operating expenses over a period of three years following completion of the acquisition. 
   
  Our Financial Results 
  We utilize a fifty-two, fifty-three week fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest December 31. For 52-week years, each quarter contains 13 weeks. The   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016   and   2015   ended on   September 30,   and   October 2,   respectively, and each contained 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively. 
  In connection with our acquisition of Lake Region Medical, we have recast our revenue by product line into the following four categories: 
             
    Cardio and Vascular   - Includes the legacy Greatbatch Vascular product line sales plus the legacy Lake Region Medical Cardio and Vascular product line sales less the legacy Lake Region Medical Cardiac/Neuromodulation sales. 
                
    Cardiac/Neuromodulation   - Includes the legacy Greatbatch Cardiac/Neuromodulation and QiG sales plus the legacy Lake Region Medical Cardiac/Neuromodulation sales previously included in their Cardio and Vascular product line sales. 
                
    Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics, and Portable Medical   - Includes legacy Greatbatch Orthopedics and Portable Medical product line sales plus the legacy Lake Region Medical Advanced Surgical product line sales. 
                
    Electrochem   - Includes the legacy Greatbatch Energy, Military and Environmental product line sales. 
     We are currently in the process of re-evaluating our internal management and financial reporting structure, which may change our product line and segment reporting in the future. This process is expected to be finalized in 2016.

Product Line Sales Highlights 
  For the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, Cardio and Vascular sales increased $134.2 million and $388.8 million, respectively, versus the comparable 2015 periods. These increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, which added approximately $136 million and $394 million, respectively, of revenue to this product line. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales in comparison to the prior year. On an organic constant currency basis, which comparison disregards revenue provided by Lake Region Medical, Cardio and Vascular sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 decreased 10% and 13%, respectively, primarily due to specific customers  working down their inventory levels. 
  For the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, Cardiac/Neuromodulation sales increased $20.2 million and $36.0 million, respectively, versus the comparable 2015 periods. The Lake Region Medical acquisition added approximately $16 million and $53 million of revenue to this product line, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales in comparison to the prior year. On an organic constant currency basis, third quarter and first nine months of 2016 Cardiac/Neuromodulation sales increased 4% and decreased 8%, respectively. Cardiac/Neuromodulation sales for the first nine months of 2016 were negatively impacted by reduced shipments in a limited number of CRM customer programs, resulting in lower orders compared to the prior year, and contractual price reductions. These impacts were driven by both internal and external delays in product launches, customer clinical market share changes, customers lowering inventory levels, and order disruption due to acquisition-related influences in the medical technology markets. These factors were partially offset by growth in sales to neuromodulation customers in the first half of 2016.  Cardiac/Neuromodulation sales stabilized during the third quarter of 2016, as the impact of certain CRM customer programs, which negatively impacted the first half of 2016, began to subside. We believe that the challenges we faced during the first half of the year in this product line are now behind us.

For the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics, and Portable Medical sales increased $50.2 million and $140.0 million, respectively, versus the comparable 2015 periods. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, which added approximately $54 million and $163 million, respectively, of revenue to this product line. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative $1 million impact on legacy Greatbatch Medical sales for this product line in comparison to the prior year nine month period. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not materially impact legacy Greatbatch Medical sales for this product line for the third quarter of 2016. On an organic constant currency basis, third quarter and first nine months of 2016 Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics, and Portable Medical sales decreased 8% and 15%, respectively, which was primarily due to portable medical customers building safety stock in the fourth quarter of 2015 in anticipation of our product line transfers, thus lowering orders in the first quarter of 2016, a backlog in shipments to one specific Portable Medical customer, and price concessions made in return for long-term volume commitments. As we look to 2017, we see slight revenue growth opportunities driven by new product launches and acceleration in targeted areas.  
  For the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, Electrochem sales declined 26% and 34%, respectively, versus the comparable 2015 periods. Foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact this product line during the quarter and the Lake Region Medical acquisition did not add any revenue to this product line. Our Electrochem product line continues to trend with the health of the oil and gas market. Although we have seen revenue declines throughout the first nine months of 2016, primarily driven by the prolonged downturn in the energy market, our customers are indicating that they believe the market has bottomed out and there are signs of a slow recovery. Electrochem volumes with our military and environmental customers remain stable. As the market has contracted, we have been able to advance our competitive position with key strategic customers resulting in multi-year supply agreements and the opportunity to quote on significant new business opportunities. We are actively pursuing new customer and market opportunities, developing new product solutions and investing in R D to advance our technology. As we manage the Electrochem product line through this challenging revenue period, we are rationalizing our cost structure and maintaining inventory at appropriate levels to improve our return on invested capital.  
   
  Gross Profit 
  Changes to gross profit as a percentage of sales ( Gross Margin ) from the prior year were due to the following:   
   
           (a) 
    Amount represents the impact to our Gross Margin related to Lake Region Medical, which was acquired in October 2015 and historically had lower Gross Margins than Greatbatch Medical. 
              (b) 
    Our Gross Margin for 2016 has been negatively impacted by lower production volumes, as well as a higher mix of sales of lower margin products partially offset by production efficiencies gained as a result of our investments in capacity and capabilities. 
              (c) 
    Amount represents the change in performance-based compensation versus the prior year and is recorded based upon the actual results achieved. 
              (d) 
    Our Gross Margin for 2016 has been negatively impacted by price concessions given to our larger OEM customers in return for long-term volume commitments.

SG A Expenses 
  Changes to SG A expenses from the prior year were due to the following (in thousands):   
   
           (a) 
    Amounts represent the change in performance-based compensation versus the prior year period and is recorded based upon actual results achieved. 
              (b) 
    Amounts represent the change in legal costs compared to the prior year period and includes IP related defense costs, as well as other corporate initiatives. In 2013, we filed suit against one of our cardiac/neuromodulation competitors alleging they were infringing on our IP. In January 2016, a jury returned a verdict finding in favor of Integer and awarded us $37.5 million in damages. The finding is subject to post-trial proceedings, including a possible appeal by our competitor. We have not recorded any gains in connection with this litigation as no cash has been received. Costs associated with this litigation accounted for approximately $0.6 million of the quarter over quarter and year over year decreases in SG A expenses from 2015 to 2016 as the trial for this litigation concluded in the first quarter of 2016. 
              (c) 
    Amounts represent the decrease in SG A costs attributable to Nuvectra, which was spun-off in March 2016.  
              (d) 
    Amounts represent the incremental SG A expenses from Lake Region Medical, which was acquired in October 2015. Note that the three and nine month amounts are approximately $20 million and $70 million, respectively, below the prior year Lake Region Medical amounts on a pro forma basis reflecting the synergies realized in connection with the acquisition. 
              (e) 
    Amounts represent the net impact of various increases and decreases to SG A costs and include the impact of normal increases in operating costs as well as increased costs associated with operating a Company that is nearly double the size of a year ago. 
      
  RD E Expenses, Net 
  Net RD E expenses are comprised of the following (in thousands): 

Net RD E expenses for the   2016     third   quarter decreased $2.9 million versus the comparable 2015 period as $0.7 million of higher customer cost reimbursements and $4.1 million less RD E expenses as a result of the Spin-off was partially offset by $2.8 million of additional RD E expenses from Lake Region Medical. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , net RD E expenses increased $2.5 million versus the comparable 2015 period primarily due to $9.1 million of net RD E costs added from Lake Region Medical, as well as $0.4 million of lower customer cost reimbursements, which were partially offset by a $8.9 million decrease in RD E as a result of the Spin-off. The remainder of the year to date increase was attributable to an increased level of research and development investments in order to support organic growth initiatives including development opportunities in the Neurostimulation, Structural Heart, Neuro Vascular and Peripheral Vascular markets, which are expected to generate future revenues over the longer-term.

Other Operating Expenses, Net 
  Other Operating Expenses, Net is comprised of the following (in thousands): 

(a) 
    Refer to  Cost Savings and Consolidation Efforts  section of this Item and Note 9  Other Operating Expenses, Net  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for disclosures related to the timing and level of remaining expenditures for these initiatives. 
              (b) 
    During the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, we incurred $5.2 million and $18.9 million, respectively, in Lake Region Medical integration costs, which primarily included professional, consulting, severance, retention, relocation, and travel costs. Additionally, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, we incurred $0.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, which primarily included change-in-control payments to former Lake Region Medical executives, as well as professional and consulting fees. We incurred $5.1 million in similar costs during the third quarter and first nine months of 2015.  Refer to Note 9  Other Operating Expenses, Net  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for disclosures related to the timing and level of remaining expenditures for acquisition and integration costs. 
              (c) 
    During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, we incurred legal and professional costs in connection with the Spin-off of Nuvectra of $4.4 million ($0.02 million in the third quarter of 2016) and $4.6 million ($3.1 million in the third quarter of 2015), respectively. Refer to Note 2  Divestiture and Acquisition  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional discussion on the Spin-off.  
     We continually evaluate our operating structure in order to maximize efficiencies and drive margin expansion. Other Operating Expenses, Net for 2016 are expected to be approximately $55 million to $65 million.  
   
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $27.9 million compared to $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense totaled $83.4 million compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2015. These increases were primarily due to $1.76 billion of debt borrowed in connection with the Lake Region Medical acquisition and $55.0 million borrowed in connection with the Spin-off. See Note 6  Debt  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional information pertaining to our debt.

Other Expense (Income), Net 
  Other Expense (Income), Net for the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015 includes income realized on our cost and equity method investments of $0.9 million ($0.2 million loss for the   third   quarter of 2016) and $5.1 million ($4.6 million gain for the   third   quarter of 2015), respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $24.4 million of investments in equity and other cost method securities. The total carrying value of these investments is reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest our investment may not be recoverable. These investments are in start-up research and development companies whose fair value is highly subjective in nature and could be subject to significant fluctuations in the future that could result in material gains or losses.  
  Other Expense (Income), Net also includes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which decreased (less income) $0.2 million and increased (more income) $0.3 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2015. Going forward, we expect the impact of foreign currency exposures could be more significant to our consolidated results versus historical levels given the inclusion of Lake Region Medical s foreign operations, which increased our exposure to foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Mexican Peso and Malaysian Ringgit. See Item 3  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  of this report for disclosures related to our most significant foreign currency exposures. 
   
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The GAAP effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 41.3% on $3.4 million of losses before the benefit for income taxes compared to 20.4% on $21.8 million of income before the provision for income taxes for the same period of 2015. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 includes the impact of a $1.6 million ($2.9 million for the third quarter of 2016) of net discrete tax benefits related to Lake Region Medical and Spin-off transaction costs. The three and nine month periods of 2015 do not include the benefit of the Federal R D tax credit, which was enacted during the fourth quarter of 2015 and has been permanently reinstated. For fiscal year 2016, the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately (30%). The GAAP tax benefit for the third quarter and expected tax benefit for full year 2016 is due to the Company having projected losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions and income in lower tax rate jurisdictions. 
  Excluding the impact of the above items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 30.0%. For the full year, our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% to 30%. This decrease is primarily attributable to the Company tax affecting its non-GAAP adjustments at the statutory rate, consistent with its adjusted diluted EPS methodology, but at the lower expected full-year effective tax rate for GAAP purposes as required. The impact from these differences is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter of 2016. Cash taxes are expected to be approximately $8 million for 2016.  
  We expect there to be continued volatility of this effective tax rate due to several factors, including the impact of the Lake Region Medical acquisition, changes in the mix of pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws and foreign tax holidays, business reorganizations, settlements with taxing authorities and foreign currency fluctuations. We continuously evaluate and currently have various tax planning initiatives in place that are aimed at reducing our effective tax rate over the long-term.

Government Regulation 
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively  Health Care Reform ) legislated broad-based changes to the U.S. healthcare system that could significantly impact our business operations and financial results, including higher or lower revenue, as well as higher employee medical costs and taxes. Health Care Reform imposes significant new taxes on medical device OEMs, which are expected to result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry and which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and our cash flows. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the medical device excise tax was suspended through December 31, 2017, but if this suspension is not continued or made permanent thereafter, the medical device excise tax will be automatically reinstated starting on January 1, 2018. Other elements of Health Care Reform, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition. Many significant parts of Health Care Reform will be phased in over the next several years and require further guidance and clarification in the form of regulations. 
  In the first quarter of 2014, we initiated a voluntary field corrective action for all Standard Offset Cup Impactors after an internal review determined that the sterilization recommendation in the instructions for use for the product did not meet requirements for sterility assurance, which has the potential to result in surgical infection. We have validated two sterilization parameters that meet acceptable sterility assurance levels and provided them to affected customers. We have informed the FDA and other government agencies of this action, which impacts all Standard Offset Cup Impactors manufactured and distributed from 2004 to 2013. We have received three complaints possibly related to this issue, however no adverse events have been reported.  
  We do not expect customer complaints, voluntary field corrective actions, or negative regulatory actions will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  However, there can be no assurance that any customer complaints, voluntary field corrective actions, or negative regulatory actions regarding our products, that may arise in the future or that which we currently believe to be immaterial, do not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the future. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, working capital, and current ratio from the end of   2015   were primarily due to the $76.3 million of cash divested with the Spin-off, which was funded with cash on hand as well as $55.0 million of borrowings on our revolving line of credit. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities for the first nine months of 2016 were $71.8 million, which were used to fund property, plant and equipment purchases of $47.0 million, as well as the repayment of $28.8 million on our outstanding term loans. Of the $45.0 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand as of   September 30, 2016  , $18.2 million is being held at our foreign subsidiaries and is considered permanently reinvested. 
  Credit Facilities     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had senior secured credit facilities (the  Senior Secured Credit Facilities ) that consists of (i) a $200 million revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), which had $50 million drawn as of   September 30, 2016  , (ii) a $361 million term loan A facility (the  TLA Facility ), and (iii) a $1,017 million term loan B facility (the  TLB Facility ).  Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had $360 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% senior notes due on November 1, 2023 (the  Senior Notes ) outstanding.  The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on October 27, 2020, the TLA Facility will mature on October 27, 2021 and the TLB Facility will mature on October 27, 2022. The TLB facility was issued at a 1% discount. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities include mandatory prepayments customary for credit facilities of its nature.

  INTEGER HOLDINGS CORPORATION 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

The Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility contain financial covenants requiring (A) a maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in the agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) of 6.5:1.00, subject to step downs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to interest expense of 3.00:1.00. As of   September 30, 2016  , our total net leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our credit agreement, was approximately 5.55 to 1.00. For the twelve month period ended   September 30, 2016  , our ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense, calculated in accordance with our credit agreement, was approximately 3.11 to 1.00. Failure to comply with these financial covenants would result in an event of default as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility unless a waiver is received from these lenders. An event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness. As a result, management believes that compliance with these covenants is material to us. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in full compliance with the financial covenants described above. We are actively monitoring our financial covenant compliance and based upon our current expectations for our 2016 adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, there is a potential that we will not be able to meet our minimum interest coverage ratio at year-end 2016. We are working with the administrative agent under our credit facilities to obtain an amendment or waiver of our financial covenants before year-end. If a waiver or amendment cannot be obtained from our lenders, an event of default may occur.  
  The Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a consortium of thirteen banks with no bank controlling more than 27% of the facility.  As of September 30, 2016, the banks supporting 88% of the Revolving Credit Facility each had an S P credit rating of at BBB+ or better, which is considered investment grade. The banks which support the remaining 12% of the Revolving Credit Facility are not currently being rated. 
  See Note 6  Debt  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for a further description on the Company s outstanding debt. 
  Summary of Cash Flows 

Operating Activities       The $40.8 million increase was due to a $26.9 million increase in cash flow provided by working capital and a $26.9 million increase in cash net income. The cash flow from working capital accounts primarily related to a $25.0 million decrease in inventory in comparison to the prior year. One of our key strategic priorities is to reduce our working capital levels, and in particular inventory levels, to improve our cash conversion cycle. Additionally, we have successfully extended payment terms with many key supply chain partners, which should also improve our cash conversion cycle. These initiatives are expected to improve our working capital levels by $25 million to $50 million by the end of 2016. 
  Investing Activities         The $14.0 million increase in net cash used was primarily attributable to higher levels of cash used in 2016 for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment in connection with the consolidation and optimization initiatives discussed in Note 9  Other Operating Expenses, Net  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report, as well as an increased level of routine capital expenditures as a result of the Lake Region Medical acquisition. Our current expectation is that capital spending for 2016 will be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, of which approximately half is discretionary in nature. We anticipate that cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures. 
  Financing Activities     The $57.0 million increase in net cash used consisted primarily of $76.3 million of cash that was divested with the Spin-off, partially offset by a $28.3 million net increase in our debt obligations.  Additionally, during the first nine months of 2016 we paid $6.8 million to purchase the remaining non-controlling interests in QiG s Algostim and PelviStim subsidiaries, which were included as part of the Spin-off.  See Note 2  Divestiture and Acquisition  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for a further description of the Spin-off.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Capital Structure     As of   September 30, 2016  , our capital structure consists of $1.8 billion of debt outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes and 30.8 million shares of common stock outstanding.  If necessary, we currently have access to   $141.1 million   under our Revolving Credit Facility. This amount may vary from period to period based upon our debt and EBITDA levels, which impacts the covenant calculations discussed above.  If necessary, we are also authorized to issue 100 million shares of common stock and 100 million shares of preferred stock.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest for the remainder of 2016, are estimated to be approximately $33 million.  
  Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents and potential borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months. If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.  However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. We have clear line of sight to the Lake Region Medical acquisition synergies and believe we will be able to de-lever the Company to 3.5X to 3X adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, over the next two to three years.  
  Non-Guarantor Information     For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , after giving pro forma effect to the completion of the Spin-off, our subsidiaries that are non-Guarantors under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities represented approximately 30% and 41% of our revenue and EBITDA, respectively. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , after giving pro forma effect to the completion of the Spin-off, our subsidiaries that are non-Guarantors under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities held approximately 27% of our total tangible assets and 3% of our total tangible liabilities. Tangible assets consist of total assets less intangible assets, intercompany receivables, and deferred taxes. Tangible liabilities consist of total liabilities less intercompany payables and deferred taxes. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 
  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), SEC, Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.   
  Contractual Obligations 
  A table of our contractual obligations as of January 1, 2016 was included in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2016. There have been no significant changes to our contractual obligations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . See Note 6  Debt  and Note 11  Commitments and Contingencies  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for further discussion on our contractual obligations. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Making estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Management believes the estimates, assumptions and judgments employed and resulting balances reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially.  
  There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Form 10-K.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Foreign Currency     As of September 30, 2016, we have foreign operations in Ireland, Germany, France, Switzerland, Mexico, Uruguay, and Malaysia, which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swiss francs, Mexican pesos, Uruguayan pesos, and Malaysian ringgits. We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk, and we use operational hedges, as well as forward currency exchange rate contracts, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $12 million on our annual sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased sales in comparison to the   2015   period by approximately $1 million. 
  We have historically entered into forward contracts to purchase Mexican pesos in order to hedge the risk of peso-denominated payments associated with our operations in Mexico. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The amounts recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   related to our forward contracts was an increase in Cost of Sales of $2.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. No portion of the change in fair value of our foreign currency exchange rate contracts during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   was considered ineffective. As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding contracts had a negative fair value of $1.4 million. See Note 11  Commitments and Contingencies  to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our outstanding forward contracts.  
  We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income (Loss). The translation adjustment for the first   nine   months of   2016   and 2015 was a gain of $12.3 million and a loss of $1.5 million, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency gains and losses included in Other Expense (Income), Net amounted to a gain of $1.8 million and $1.6 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro, our most significant foreign currency net asset exposure, would have had an impact of approximately $44 million on our foreign net assets as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest Rates     Historically, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on our outstanding variable rate debt. As a result of the Lake Region Medical acquisition, the forecasted cash flows that our interest rate swaps were hedging were no longer expected to occur. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we terminated our outstanding interest rate swap agreements at that time.  
  On June 20, 2016, we entered into a three-year $200 million interest rate swap with an effective date of June 27, 2017 to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on our outstanding variable rate debt, which are also indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate. Under the terms of the swap agreem  ent, we will receive a floating interest rate indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate and pay a fixed interest rate of 1.1325%. The variable rate received on the interest swap and the variable rate paid on the outstanding borrowings will have the same rate of interest, excluding the credit spread, and will reset and pay interest on the same date. The swap is being accounted for as a cash flow hedge.  As of     September 30, 2016  , this swap has a negative fair value of $1.0 million.    
  On July 7, 2016, we entered into an additional one-year $250 million interest rate swap     with an effective date of July 27, 2016     to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on outstanding borrowings under     our outstanding variable rate debt  . The swap will terminate on July 27, 2017. Under the terms of the swap agreement, the Company will pay a fixed interest rate of 0.615% and receive a floating interest rate equal to the one-month LIBOR rate. The variable rate received on the interest swap and the variable rate paid on the outstanding borrowings will have the same rate of interest, excluding the credit spread, and will reset and pay interest on the same date. The swap is being accounted for as a cash flow hedge. As of     September 30, 2016  , this swap has a positive fair value of $0.1 million.

     Table of Contents  

As of September 30, 2016, we had $1.8 billion in principal outstanding on our debt, of which $360 million related to our Senior Notes which has a fixed interest rate of 9.125%, $361 million related to our TLA Facility and $50 million related to our Revolving Credit Facility, which both have a variable interest rate, and $1,017 million related to our TLB Facility which has a 1.00% LIBOR floor, and as such, has a variable interest rate when LIBOR is above 1.00%. Interest rates on our TLA Facility, TLB Facility, and Revolving Credit Facility reset, at our option, based upon the prime rate or LIBOR rate, thus subjecting us to interest rate risk. We continuously evaluate our interest rate exposures and may take steps to mitigate these exposures as appropriate. Refer to Note 6  Debt  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional information about our outstanding debt. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) increase in the LIBOR rate on the $1.2 billion of unhedged variable rate debt outstanding would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $7 million.

     Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) related to the recording, processing, summarization and reporting of information in our reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of   September 30, 2016  . These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to us, including our subsidiaries, is made known to our management, including these officers, by our employees, and that this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Based on their evaluation, as of   September 30, 2016  , our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
           b. 
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
     We acquired the following subsidiary during 2015:  
             
    Lake Region Medical Holdings, Inc. 
     We believe that the internal controls and procedures of the above mentioned subsidiary are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. We are currently in the process of incorporating the internal controls and procedures of this subsidiary into our internal controls over financial reporting. 
  The Company is extending its Section 404 compliance program under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  Act ) and the applicable rules and regulations under such Act to include this subsidiary. However, the Company excluded this subsidiary from management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2016 as permitted by the guidance issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
  Other than as described above, there were no changes in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

October 7, 2016 
    
  Jeremy Friedman 
  97 Cedar Street 
  Wenham, MA 01984 
    
  Dear Jeremy: 
    
  I am very pleased to confirm our offer to you to assume the position of Chief Operating Officer of Integer Holdings Corporation (the  Company ), reporting directly to me.  Allowing for work-related travel, it is anticipated that you will spend approximately one-half of your time working out of the Company s offices in the Frisco-Plano, Texas area.  The  Effective Date  for your new position will be October 10, 2016. 
  You agree to perform your duties, which will be the duties customarily performed by a Chief Operating Officer, and discharge your responsibilities in a faithful manner to the best of your ability.  You agree to devote your full business time and attention to the leadership and conduct of your function and the business to the best of your ability.  You also agree that you will not accept other gainful employment or engage in any outside business concerns or activities without the consent of the Company.   
  Compensation  
  Base Salary  :  As of the Effective Date, your base salary will be increased to $550,000 per annum, payable bi-weekly at a rate of $21,153.85.  The Company will, in good faith, review your performance and salary on an annual basis, and will consider appropriate increases in your salary, but will not decrease your salary, based on your performance and the successful achievement of agreed upon objectives.  Our performance year is consistent with the calendar year. 
  Housing Allowance  .  As of the Effective Date, you will receive a monthly housing allowance of $2,500 to help you offset the cost of temporary housing you expect to secure in the Plano, Texas area.  If you relocate a portion of your household goods to your temporary residence to the Dallas area, you will be eligible for relocations benefits up to a maximum amount of $10,000, in accordance with the Company's relocation program, a copy of which has been provided to you.  
    
  Airfare  .  Beginning with the Effective Date, the Company will pay the reasonable cost of round trip coach airfare to and from Dallas, Texas for you and your spouse each month. 
  Short-Term Incentive Award  :  Based on your level, your eligibility for short term cash incentive will be 80% of base salary at target, with the opportunity for 155% at maximum.  Provided that you are not terminated for Cause and further provided that a short-term incentive award is awarded by the Company for a given year during which you worked the full year, the short-term incentive award will be paid to you in the following year whether or not you are in the Company s employ on the payment date.  Your 2016 short term cash incentive will in any event remain at the greater of $357,000 or the actual amount earned under the short term incentive plan, to be paid at the time such incentives are paid to other employees.  If your employment is terminated prior to December 31, 2016, your short term cash incentive will be pro-rated. 
  Long-Term Incentive Award  . Effective on January 3, 2017, you will receive a long term incentive equity award valued at $2,100,000 consisting of time based Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) that will vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period with the first installment vesting on the last day of fiscal year 2017, provided that such RSUs will not be eligible for accelerated Retirement vesting treatment under the Stock Incentive Plan before March 31, 2019.  Our most recent Stock Incentive Plan prospectus  

is enclosed for your reference.  The number of RSUs that you will be awarded will be equal to $2,100,000, divided by the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January 3, 2017. 
  If at any time the Company terminates your employment for a reason other than Cause or you terminate your employment for Good Reason, then the NSQOs described below that have not previously vested at the time you terminate employment shall immediately vest and will be exercisable during the twelve-month period following termination. If at any time the Company terminates your employment for a reason other than Cause or you terminate your employment for Good Reason, then the RSUs described above that have not previously vested at the time you terminate employment  shall immediately vest based upon a formula that multiplies the number of unvested RSUs by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months that have elapsed between the Effective Date and the date of termination, plus twelve, and the denominator of which is 30.     
  Special Equity Grant  :  We also are pleased to provide you with an equity grant consisting of non-qualified stock options ( NQSO ) for 50,000 shares of the Company s common stock.  The NQSOs will have an exercise price fixed at the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the close of business on the grant date.  The NQSOs will vest and become exercisable in three equal installments on the last day of each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 2017, provided (except as set forth in this agreement and in the NQSO award agreement) you remain continuously employed by the Company through each applicable vesting date.  For the avoidance of doubt, all of the NQSOs are eligible for accelerated Retirement vesting treatment as of the date of grant. 
  Prior Sign On Cash Bonus  :  The remaining portion to be paid under the Sign On Cash Bonus provided in the offer letter dated January 8, 2016, in the amount of $617,500, will be paid to you on or about December 30, 2016, whether or not you are in the Company s employ on the payment date. 
  Other Benefits 
  You will continue to be entitled to participate in the programs from time to time generally offered to the Executives of the Company.  These plans, policies and programs are subject to change at the sole discretion of the Company.  The current benefits currently include the following: 
  Life Insurance  :  At the Company s expense, term life insurance with a total face value of $1,000,000, with the death beneficiary designated by you. 
  Disability  :  Participation in the Executive long term disability program currently providing a benefit equal to 60% of base salary and short-term incentive (short-term incentive is calculated using the average of payments from the last two years).        
  Executive Physical Examination  :   Consistent with our interest in you maintaining your personal health, eligibility for the key management Physical Examination Program.  
  Financial Planning Assistance  :  This benefit provides reimbursement of certain expenses incurred in connection with your personal financial and estate planning.    
  Director and Officer Liability and Fiduciary Insurance  :  You are covered by the Company s Director and Officer Liability Insurance policies.  In addition, you will be covered by the Company s fiduciary liability insurance for any service related to employee benefit plans.

Given that you may be required to attend evening events and/or dinners, the Company will reimburse you for related travel, hotel and meal expenses.  The Company also will reimburse you for the attorney s fees incurred by you in connection with this offer, up to a maximum amount of $17,000.  Payment will be made as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of your submission of documentation of the total amount of attorney s fees incurred, but in no event later than March 15, 2017.

  Termination of Employment 
  If at any time, the Company terminates your employment for a reason other than Cause or you terminate your employment for Good Reason, within 15 days of your termination of employment, the Company will pay you (a) any unpaid salary through the date of termination, (b) any incurred but not yet reimbursed expenses (including, without limitation, any housing expenses and any airfare for you and your wife reimbursable under this agreement), and (c) any accrued and Paid Time Off (the  Accrued Obligations ).  In addition, you will be entitled to you will be entitled to a payment of an amount equivalent to: (a) one and one-half times the sum of your base salary, as in effect on the date of termination and your annual bonuses earned for the prior fiscal year under the short term incentive program as in effect from time to time; and (b) the value of 18 months of premiums  in the Company s group health plan (for you and your spouse and/or eligible dependents to the extent covered immediately prior to your termination) at the rate in effect as of your separation date ( Severance Pay ).  In addition, if you terminate your employment without Good Reason with the Company prior to January 1, 2017, you will receive from the Company the value of 18 months of premiums in the Company s group health plan (for you and your spouse and/or eligible dependents to the extent covered immediately prior to your termination) in a lump sum payment as soon as reasonably practicable following the 15   th    calendar day after the date of termination of your employment.  As a condition of receipt of the Severance Pay, you will be required to execute a Separation Agreement and Release satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable discretion within 45 days after the date of termination of your employment and not thereafter revoke the Separation Agreement and Release as permitted therein.   
  The Severance Pay will be less applicable tax withholdings and will commence to be paid as soon as reasonably practicable following the 60   th    calendar day after the date of termination of your employment.

  If your employment is terminated for Cause, or due to your death or disability, the Company will pay the Accrued Obligations within 15 business days of your termination of employment.  If your employment is terminated for Cause, or due to your death or disability,     to the extent you are entitled to benefits under the Change in Control Agreement, you will not be eligible for Severance Pay under this agreement.  
   Cause,  for purposes of this Agreement, means a material breach of this agreement, which is not cured within 15 days after written notice to you specifying in detail the nature of the material breach, or material breach of the Inventions, Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of your duties, dishonesty to the Company, or the commission of a felony that results in a conviction of law.

  At-Will Employment 
  In accepting this new position with the Company, you certify that you understand and accept that your employment continues to be on an at-will basis, and that except as expressly set forth herein neither you nor any Company representative has entered into a contract regarding the terms or the duration of your employment.  As an at-will employee, you will be free to terminate your employment with the Company at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.  Likewise, the Company will have the right to terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.  
  It is intended that all payments and benefits under this agreement shall either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and that this agreement shall be interpreted, to the maximum extent possible, such that there shall be no adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A with respect to any such payments and benefits.  Any terms of  

this agreement that are undefined or ambiguous shall be interpreted in a manner that makes the payment or benefit in question exempt from, or compliant with, Code Section 409A.  The Company and you agree to take such actions as may be permissible to correct any Code Section 409A failures under this Agreement and to comply in operation with the requirements of Code Section 409A. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, any payments and benefits to be provided by the Company that constitute  deferred compensation  within the meaning of Code Section 409A and that are payable in connection with your termination of employment shall not be paid or commence in connection with your termination of employment unless and until you have also incurred a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, unless the Company reasonably determines that such amounts may be provided to you without causing you to incur adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A. 
  All expenses or other reimbursements payable to you that are taxable income to you shall in no event be paid later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which you incur such expense.  With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses or in-kind benefits, except as permitted by Code Section 409A, the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year. 
  Prior Agreements 
  This Agreement supersedes your offer letter dated January 8, 2016 and all amendments thereto and you hereby forfeit any rights or entitlements that you may have had under such offer letter and release and discharge the Company, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, of and from any cause of action, obligation, liability or other obligations to you under any such letter.
