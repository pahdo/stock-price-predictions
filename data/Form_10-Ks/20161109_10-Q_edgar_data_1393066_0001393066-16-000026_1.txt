  RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. 
  Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
  Nature of operations 
  Resolute Forest Products Inc. (with its subsidiaries and affiliates, either individually or collectively, unless otherwise indicated, referred to as  Resolute Forest Products,   we,   our,   us,   Parent  or the  Company ) is incorporated in Delaware. We are a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers, which are marketed in close to   80   countries. We own or operate over   40   pulp, paper, tissue and wood products facilities in the United States, Canada and South Korea, as well as power generation assets in Canada and the United States. 
  Financial statements 
  Our interim Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim reporting. Under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are normally required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles may be condensed or omitted. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. The results for the interim period ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on   February 29, 2016  . Certain prior period amounts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on total assets. 
  Change in depreciable lives of machinery and equipment 
  We periodically review the estimated economic useful lives of our fixed assets. Based on this review, during the first quarter of 2016, we prospectively changed our estimate of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment to reflect a net increase of estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment were changed to a range of   five   to   25 years  , increasing the weighted-average estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment by   two years  . The effect of this change in estimate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was to reduce  Depreciation and amortization , and increase    Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc.   , and basic and diluted    Net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. common shareholders    in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows:

New accounting pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective or prospective basis as required for each amendment. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  In March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  ASU 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  respectively, which further affect the guidance of ASU 2014-09. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position.

  RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. 
  Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  which introduces the current expected credit losses model in the estimation of credit losses on financial instruments. This update is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact the presentation of our cash flows. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,  which eliminates the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory until the transferred assets are sold to a third party or recovered through use. This update is effective on a modified retrospective approach for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period, we plan to adopt this ASU as of January 1, 2017, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to  Deficit  in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. The adoption of this accounting guidance will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   
  Note 2. Acquisition of Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. 
  On November 16, 2015 (the  acquisition date ), we acquired Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Atlas Paper ), a manufacturer of a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and private-label at-home markets, including virgin and recycled products, covering economy, value and premium grades and operating two tissue mills and a recycling facility in Florida. 
  In 2016, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the purchase price allocation due to a change in our preliminary valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, which is still subject to adjustment during the 12-month measurement period following the acquisition date or upon completion of the final valuation. As a result, we increased  Goodwill  by $2 million and decreased  Fixed assets, net  and  Amortizable intangible assets, net,  each by $1 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  We are still in the process of evaluating new information relating to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to validate the valuation of certain acquired intangibles assets, which will result in a reallocation of the purchase price. We are presently finalizing the amounts of the reallocation of the purchase price and expect to record a decrease to  Amortizable intangible assets, net,  which could range from $25 million to $35 million, and a corresponding increase to  Goodwill,  net of tax of approximately $10 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the fourth quarter of 2016, prior to the completion of the measurement period, as permitted. 
  The amount of Atlas Paper s sales and net loss included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations were   $23 million   and   $5 million  , respectively, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and were   $70 million   and   $11 million  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The following unaudited pro forma information for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   represents our results of operations as if the acquisition of Atlas Paper had occurred on January 1, 2015. This pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results that would have occurred for the periods presented or that may be expected in the future.

These charges were included in  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs  in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
   
  Note 8. Long-Term Debt 
  Overview 
  Long-term debt, including current portion, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was comprised of the following: 

2023 Notes 
  We issued   $600 million   in aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   senior notes due 2023 (the  2023 Notes ) on May 8, 2013. Upon their issuance, the notes were recorded at their fair value of   $594 million  , which reflected a discount of   $6 million   that is being amortized to  Interest expense  in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of

  Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

the notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of   6%  . Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, until their maturity date of May 15, 2023. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we incurred financing costs of approximately   $9 million  , which were deferred and recorded as a reduction of the notes. These deferred financing costs are being amortized to  Interest expense  in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of the notes. The fair value of the 2023 Notes was   $522 million   and   $440 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was determined by reference to over-the-counter prices (Level 1). 
  ABL Credit Facility 
  Our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the  ABL Credit Facility ) has a maturity date of May 22, 2020 and provides an aggregate lender commitment of up to   $600 million   at any time outstanding, subject to borrowing base availability based on specified advance rates, eligibility criteria and customary reserves. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $376 million   of availability under the ABL Credit Facility, net of   $40 million   of borrowings and   $29 million   of ordinary course letters of credit outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the ABL Credit Facility approximated its carrying value as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). 
  Senior Secured Credit Facility 
  On September 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (the  Senior Secured Credit Facility ) for up to   $185 million  . The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a term loan of   $46 million   with a maturity date of September 7, 2025 ( Term Loan ), a revolving credit facility of up to   $139 million   with a maturity date of September 7, 2022 ( Revolving Credit Facility ), and also provides an uncommitted option to increase the Senior Secured Credit Facility by up to   $175 million  , subject to certain terms and conditions. 
  The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a first priority mortgage on the real property of our Calhoun, Tennessee, facility and a first priority security interest on the fixtures and equipment located therein. 
  Interest rates under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are based, at the Company s election, on either a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), or a base rate, in each case plus a spread over the index. The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.5%  ; and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus   1%  . The applicable spread over the index fluctuates quarterly based upon the Company s capitalization ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the Company s funded indebtedness to the sum of the Company s funded indebtedness and its net worth. For the Term Loan, the initial applicable spread is   1%   for base rate loans and   2%   for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from   0.875%   to   1.5%   for base rate loans, and from   1.875%   to   2.5%   for LIBOR rate loans. For loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the initial applicable spread is   0.625%   for base rate loans and   1.625%   for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from   0.5%   to   1.125%   for base rate loans, and from   1.5%   to   2.125%   for LIBOR rate loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was issued by eight lenders within the farm credit system and will be eligible for patronage refunds. Patronage refunds are distributions of profits from lenders in the farm credit system, which are cooperatives that are required to distribute profits to their members. Patronage distributions, which are made in either cash or stock, are received in the year after they were earned. Future refunds will be dependent on future farm credit lender profits, made at the discretion of each farm credit lender. 
  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to pay a fee in respect of unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility equal to   0.325%   per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to   35%   of the total revolving commitments, and   0.275%   per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is greater than   35%   of the total revolving commitments. The fee for unutilized commitments will be   0.325%   per annum initially. 
  Base rate loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be repaid from time to time at our discretion without premium or penalty. LIBOR rate loans may be repaid from time to time at our discretion, subject to breakage costs, if any. Amounts repaid on the Term Loan may not be subsequently re-borrowed. Principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn, repaid, and redrawn until September 6, 2022. 
  Pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are also required to maintain a capitalization ratio not greater than   45%   at all times, available liquidity of not less than   $100 million  , and a collateral coverage ratio of not less than   1.8   to 1.0 (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence and repayment of indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of liens; (iv) restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries making certain restricted payments; (v)  
  
   11

  Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations, and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to material indebtedness. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties, and, subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, also contains certain customary events of default. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $89 million   of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of   $50 million   of borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the fair values of the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility approximated their carrying values as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). 
  Capital lease obligation 
  We have a capital lease obligation for a warehouse with a maturity date of December 1, 2017, which can be renewed for   20 years   at our option. Minimum monthly payments are determined by an escalatory price clause. 
   
  Note 9. Employee Benefit Plans 
  Pension and OPEB plans 
  The components of net periodic benefit cost relating to our pension and OPEB plans for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , were as follows: 
  Pension Plans: 

OPEB Plans: 

Defined contribution plans 
  Our expense for the defined contribution plans totaled   $6 million and $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $16 million and $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 10. Income Taxes 
  The   income tax benefit (provision)   attributable to   income (loss) before income taxes   differs from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , as a result of the following: 

(1)   
    We recorded a valuation allowance of $20 million and $16 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $65 million and $43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. 
               (2)   
    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded tax benefits of $37 million, almost all of which related to the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations of the applicable jurisdictions. 
               (3)   
    During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of   $18 million   as a result of a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes, primarily due to an intercompany asset transfer in connection with an operating company realignment. 
               (4)   
    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $4 million upon the completion of a tax audit. 
     Deferred tax charge 
  As a result of a gain on an intercompany asset transfer in connection with an operating company realignment in 2015, a   $36 million   income tax provision was deferred and recorded in  Other assets  in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . This deferred tax charge is amortized, as the underlying assets are consumed or sold to an unrelated party, in    Income tax benefit (provision)    in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Legal matters 
  We become involved in various legal proceedings and other disputes in the normal course of business, including matters related to contracts, commercial disputes, taxes, environmental issues, activists  damages, employment and workers  compensation claims, Aboriginal claims and other matters. Although the final outcome is subject to many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, we regularly assess the status of the matters and establish provisions (including legal costs expected to be incurred) when we believe an adverse outcome is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Except as described below and for claims that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters outstanding or pending as of   September 30, 2016  , will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Effective January 1, 2015, we modified our U.S. OPEB plan so that unionized participants, upon reaching Medicare eligibility, are provided Medicare coverage via a Medicare Exchange program rather than via a Company-sponsored medical plan. On March 2, 2016, a proposed class action lawsuit (  Reynolds, et al v. Resolute Forest Products Inc., Resolute FP US Inc., Resolute FP US Health and Resolute Welfare Benefit Plan  ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of certain Medicare-eligible retirees who were previously unionized employees of our Calhoun, Tennessee; Catawba, South Carolina; and Coosa Pines, Alabama, mills, and their spouses and dependents. The plaintiffs allege that the modifications described above breach the collective bargaining agreements and plan covering the members of the proposed class in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the health care benefits as in effect before January 1, 2015, for the proposed class in the lawsuit. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to defend the action. On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The proposed class action lawsuit is at a preliminary stage and no class has been certified. Accordingly, we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter or to reasonably estimate the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  On February 26, 2015, a countervailing duty petition was filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce ( Commerce ) and the U.S. International Trade Commission ( Trade Commission ) by certain U.S. supercalendered ( SC ) paper producers requesting the U.S. government to impose countervailing duties on Canadian-origin SC paper exported to the U.S. market. One of our subsidiaries was identified in the petition as being a Canadian exporting producer of SC paper to the U.S. and was selected as a mandatory respondent to be individually investigated by Commerce. On August 3, 2015, Commerce assigned a preliminary subsidy rate of   2.04%   to our SC paper produced at our Canadian mills. On October 15, 2015, Commerce issued a final determination and increased the subsidy rate applicable to our Canadian-produced SC paper to   17.87%  . In December 2015, the Trade Commission ruled that exports of SC paper from Canada to the U.S. have caused or threatened to cause material injury to the U.S. SC paper industry and Commerce issued its final order on the basis of the   17.87%   rate. As a result, since October 20, 2015, we have been required to make cash deposits at the   17.87%   subsidy rate for estimated and projected countervailing duties on SC papers we import to the U.S. from our Canadian mills. We will be required to continue making cash deposits at that rate until Commerce sets a countervailing duty rate in an administrative review, which may not be finalized until December of 2017, or possibly later. Resolute has appealed the determination of Commerce to a bi-national panel under the North American Free Trade Agreement. A hearing on that appeal was held on October 25, 2016, and Resolute is waiting for the panel's decision. Based on our current operating parameters, the cash deposits could be as high as   $25 million   per year. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have made   $21 million   of cash deposits. To the extent the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is lower than   17.87%  , we will recover excess deposits, plus interest. If the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is at or above   17.87%  , the deposits and any deficiency will be converted into actual countervailing duties. We are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter, but we believe it is not probable that we will be assessed with significant countervailing duties. Accordingly,   no   contingent loss was recorded in respect of this petition in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Effective July 31, 2012, we completed the final step of the transaction pursuant to which we acquired the remaining   25.4%   of the outstanding Fibrek Inc. ( Fibrek ) shares, following the approval of Fibrek s shareholders on July 23, 2012, and the issuance of a final order of the Quebec Superior Court in Canada approving the arrangement on July 27, 2012. Certain former shareholders of Fibrek exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent in respect of the transaction, asking for a judicial determination of the fair value of their claim under the   Canada Business Corporations Act  .   No   consideration has to date been paid to the former Fibrek shareholders who exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent. Any such consideration will only be paid out upon settlement or judicial determination of the fair value of their claims and will be paid entirely in cash. Accordingly, we cannot presently determine the amount that ultimately will be paid to former holders of Fibrek shares in connection with the proceedings, but we have accrued approximately Cdn   $14 million   (  $11 million  , based on the exchange rate

in effect on   September 30, 2016  ) for the eventual payment of those claims. The hearing in this matter is expected to begin in 2019. 
  On June 12, 2012, we filed a motion for directives with the Quebec Superior Court, the Canadian court with jurisdiction in the creditor protection proceedings from which AbitibiBowater Inc. (our predecessor entity) and all but one of its affiliates emerged in 2010 (the  Creditor Protection Proceedings ), seeking an order to prevent pension regulators in each of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador from declaring partial wind-ups of pension plans relating to employees of former operations in New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, or a declaration that any claim for accelerated reimbursements of deficits arising from a partial wind-up is a barred claim under the Creditor Protection Proceedings. These plans are subject to the funding relief regulations described in Note 13,  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans - Canadian pension funding,  to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and we contend, among other things, that any such declaration, if issued, would be inconsistent with the Quebec Superior Court s sanction order confirming the plan of reorganization and the terms of our emergence from the Creditor Protection Proceedings. A partial wind-up would likely shorten the period in which any deficit within those plans, which could reach up to Cdn   $150 million   (  $115 million  , based on the exchange rate in effect on   September 30, 2016  ), would have to be funded if we do not obtain the relief sought. No hearing date has been set to date. 
  Environmental matters 
  We are subject to a variety of federal or national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental regulations promulgated in the future could require substantial additional expenditures for compliance and could have a material impact on us, in particular, and the industry in general. 
  We may be a  potentially responsible party  with respect to   four   hazardous waste sites that are being addressed pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act corrective action authority. We believe we will not be liable for any significant amounts at any of these sites. 
  We have recorded   $9 million   and   $12 million   of environmental liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, primarily related to environmental remediation related to closed sites. The amount of these liabilities represents management s estimate of the ultimate settlement based on an assessment of relevant factors and assumptions and could be affected by changes in facts or assumptions not currently known to management for which the outcome cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. These liabilities are included in  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  or  Other liabilities  in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  We have also recorded   $22 million   and   $23 million   of asset retirement obligations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, primarily consisting of liabilities associated with landfills, sludge basins and the dismantling of retired assets. These liabilities are included in  Other liabilities  in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Other matters 
  On October 30, 2014, we received a notice from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry of Ontario (the  MNRF ) directing us to repay a conditional incentive of Cdn   $23 million   (  $18 million  , based on the exchange rate in effect on   September 30, 2016  ) offered in 2007 toward the construction of an electricity-producing turbine, should we fail to restart our Fort Frances, Ontario, pulp and paper mill or otherwise implement an alternative remedy that is acceptable to the MNRF. Several extensions to implement an alternative remedy have been granted to us by the MNRF, with the latest remedy date being January 2, 2017. We announced the permanent closure of the mill in the second quarter of 2014 and have been exploring a number of opportunities for the mill. We are not presently able to determine the outcome of this process, but we currently believe that we could reach an acceptable outcome for the MNRF. Accordingly, we have recorded   no   contingent liability in respect of this notice in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Note 12. Share Capital 
  On May 28, 2015, our board of directors authorized a   $50 million   increase to our existing   $100 million   share repurchase program, which was originally launched in May of 2012. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 2.3 million and 5.5 million shares, respectively, at a cost of $22 million and $59 million, respectively. We did not repurchase any shares during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . There remains   $24 million   under the program.

Note 13. Segment Information 
  We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Accordingly, our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. 
  None of the income or loss items following    Operating income (loss)    in our Consolidated Statements of Operations are allocated to our segments, since those items are reviewed separately by management. For the same reason, closure costs, impairment and other related charges, inventory write-downs related to closures, start-up costs, gains and losses on disposition of assets, certain components of pension and OPEB costs and credits as well as other discretionary charges or credits are not allocated to our segments. We allocate depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although the related fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are not allocated to segment assets. Additionally, all selling, general and administrative expenses are allocated to our segments, with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under  corporate and other.  
  Information about certain segment data for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was as follows:

    As discussed in     Note 1,  Organization and Basis of Presentation  ,  we   changed our estimate of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment to reflect a net increase of estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The effect of this change in estimate was to (decrease) increase  Depreciation and amortization  by reportable segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as follows:

  O  VERVIEW 
  Resolute Forest Products is a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers, which are marketed in close to 80 countries. The company owns or operates over 40 pulp, paper, tissue and wood products facilities in the United States, Canada and South Korea, as well as power generation assets in Canada and the United States. We are the biggest Canadian producer of wood products east of the Rockies and one of the most significant pulp producers in North America. By capacity, we are the number one producer of newsprint in the world and the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America. We are also an emerging tissue producer. 
  We report our activities in five business segments: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. 
  We are guided by our vision and values, focusing on safety, profitability, accountability, sustainability and teamwork. These are the elements that we believe best define us: 
             
    Competitive cost structure   - as a result of aggressive cost reductions and mill rationalizations, today we compete as a leading, lower-cost North American producer. Maintaining this competitive advantage is our key focus. We are committed to maximizing shareholder value and earnings power by: stressing our guiding principles of operational excellence in everything we do; pushing to optimize our asset base in order to maximize the utilization of our most cost-effective mills; and streamlining production to adapt to changing market dynamics. 
                
    Synergistic and diversified asset base   - we apply our principles of operational excellence to our synergistic and diversified asset base, one that has evolved with time as we execute our gradual retreat from certain paper grades toward more sustainable long-term businesses. Put simply, we use cash flow from our optimized paper segments to grow our business for the long-term, including: the Calhoun, Tennessee, tissue manufacturing and converting facility scheduled for ramp-up in 2017; the two tissue mills and the three pulp mills we acquired in 2015 and 2012, respectively; the capacity enhancement initiatives in wood products; and the continuous pulp digester project at the Calhoun pulp and paper facility. This synergistic and complementary asset base also offers the fiber management advantage of integration and earnings diversification. 
                
    Financial strength   - we make disciplined capital management a priority; we believe in maintaining a flexible and conservative capital structure. Our financial strength gives us the ability to consider a range of suitable opportunities to expand our activities in market pulp, tissue and wood products, all of which have strong growth potential. 
     Our Business 
  For information relating to our business, including our products, strategy, sustainable performance and development, and power generation assets, refer to our   2015   Annual Report. 
  Third Quarter   Overview 
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 
  Our operating income was   $10 million   in the quarter, compared to operating income of   $6 million   in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding special items, we generated operating income of   $17 million  , compared to   $23 million   in the year-ago period. Special items are described below. 
  Our net income in the quarter was   $14 million  , or   $0.15   per share, compared to a net loss of   $6 million  , or   $0.07   per share, in the year-ago period. Our net income in the quarter, excluding special items, was   $19 million  , or   $0.21   per share, compared to net income, excluding special items, of   $14 million  , or   $0.15   per share, in the year-ago period.

    Operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share (or    EPS   ), in each case as adjusted for special items, are not financial measures recognized under GAAP. We calculate operating income (loss), as adjusted for special items, as operating income (loss) from our Consolidated Statements of Operations, adjusted for items such as closure costs, impairment and other related charges, inventory write-downs related to closures, start-up costs, gains and losses on disposition of assets, non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit (or    OPEB   ) costs and credits, and other charges or credits that are excluded from our segment s performance from GAAP operating income (loss). We calculate net income (loss), as adjusted for special items, as net income (loss) from our Consolidated Statements of Operations, adjusted for the same special items applied to operating income (loss), in addition to foreign exchange translation gains and losses, other income (expense), net, and the income tax effect of the special items. EPS, as adjusted for special items, is calculated as net income (loss), as adjusted for special items, per diluted share. We believe that using these non-GAAP measures is useful because they are consistent with the indicators management uses internally to measure the Company s performance, and it allows the reader to more easily compare our operations and financial performance from period to period. Operating income (loss), net income (loss) and EPS, in each case as adjusted for special items, are internal measures, and therefore may not be comparable to those of other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes to financial measures determined under GAAP.

  Our operating loss was   $8 million  , in the first nine months of the year, compared to operating income of   $7 million   in the year-ago period. Excluding special items, we generated operating income of   $55 million  , compared to   $59 million   in the year-ago period. Special items are described below. 
  Our net loss in the first nine months of the year was   $36 million  , or   $0.40   per share, compared to a net loss of   $43 million  , or   $0.46   per share, for the first nine months of 2015. Our net income in the period, excluding special items, was   $7 million  , or   $0.08   per share, compared to net income, excluding special items, of   $2 million  , or   $0.02   per share, in the year-ago period.

  Consolidated Results 
  Selected financial information 

(1)    
    Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, or    EBITDA    and adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures recognized under GAAP. EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) including noncontrolling interests from the Consolidated Statements of Operations, adjusted for interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA, excluding special items, such as foreign exchange translation gains and losses, closure costs, impairment and other related charges, inventory write-downs related to closures, start-up costs, gains and losses on disposition of assets, non-operating pension and OPEB costs and credits, and other charges or credits. We believe that using non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is useful because they are consistent with the indicators management uses internally to measure the Company s performance and it allows the reader to more easily compare our operations and financial performance from period to period. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are internal measures, and therefore may not be comparable to those of other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes to financial measures determined under GAAP.

On November 16, 2015 (or the    acquisition date   ), we acquired Atlas Paper, a manufacturer of a range of tissue products. We began consolidating the results of operations of Atlas Paper in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the acquisition date. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the tissue segment generated sales of   $23 million   and   $70 million  , respectively, and incurred an operating loss of   $5 million   and   $11 million  , respectively. 
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 
  Operating income   variance analysis 
  
  Sales 
  Excluding Atlas Paper sales of   $23 million  , sales were $40 million, or 4%, lower than in the year-ago period, to   $888 million  . Volume had a $41 million unfavorable impact, which reflects a decline of 10% in shipments of market pulp, 9% in newsprint and 7% in specialty papers, partially offset by higher shipments in wood products of 20%. Overall pricing was up by $1 million, reflecting an increase of 5% in the average transaction price for wood products and 3% for newsprint, almost entirely offset by a drop of 5% in the average transaction price for market pulp, and 3% for specialty papers.

Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs, which we refer to as    COS   , were   $6 million   lower in the quarter. After removing the effects of the Canadian dollar fluctuation, given that approximately 60% of our production capacity is based in Canada, and the lower overall volume, offset in part by the COS related to the newly acquired Atlas Paper, manufacturing costs increased by $3 million, reflecting: 
             
    a favorable property tax adjustment and the recognition of tax credits in connection with infrastructure investments, in the year-ago period ($13 million); 
                
    unfavorable chemical costs ($7 million); and 
                
    higher maintenance and labor costs ($5 million); 
     mostly offset by: 
             
    lower wood costs ($9 million), including lower fuel prices and favorable usage; 
                
    lower defined benefit pension and OPEB plans costs ($7 million), mostly due to lower amortization of actuarial losses, as a result of the lower balance sheet net pension and OPEB liability as of December 31, 2015; and 
                
    better power costs ($5 million), mostly price-related, including a benefit from the reduced power rates on Quebec s north shore to compensate for the higher cost related to processing spruce budworm infested wood. 
     Distribution costs 
  After removing the effect of lower volume, distribution costs were $4 million lower than in the year-ago period, primarily due to lower fuel surcharges, and the expiration of the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (or the    SLA   ) in October 2015, under which our Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S. had been subject to export duties ($2 million). 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization was   $8 million   lower in the quarter, largely reflecting the reduced carrying value of our Catawba, South Carolina, paper assets after the $176 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, the net increase of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment, and the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta, Georgia, mill in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by the depreciation and amortization related to the newly acquired Atlas Paper. 
  Net income (loss)   variance analysis 
  Income taxes 
  We recorded an income tax benefit of   $14 million   in the quarter, on income before income taxes of   $1 million  , compared to none expected based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects a $37 million adjustment primarily related to the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations of the applicable jurisdictions, partially offset by a   $20 million   valuation allowance related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. 
  In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an income tax provision of   $2 million  , on a loss before income taxes of   $4 million  , compared to an expected income tax benefit of   $1 million   based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects a   $16 million   valuation allowance primarily related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets and foreign exchange related items, offset in part by a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes due to an intercompany asset transfer in connection with an operating company realignment.

  Sales 
  Excluding Atlas Paper sales of   $70 million  , sales were $165 million, or 6%, lower than in the year-ago period, to   $2,656 million  . Sales volume decreased by $45 million because of lower shipments in newsprint, down by 6%, as well as market pulp and specialty papers, both down by 2%, only partially offset by higher shipments in wood products, up by 9%. Pricing had an unfavorable impact of $120 million, including the effect of currency of $6 million, reflecting a 7% drop in the average transaction price for market pulp, 4% for newsprint, 4% for specialty papers, and 2% for wood products. 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  COS were   $71 million   lower in the period. After removing the effects of the Canadian dollar fluctuation and the lower volume, offset in part by the COS related to the newly acquired Atlas Paper, manufacturing costs improved by $34 million, reflecting: 
             
    lower defined benefit pension and OPEB plans costs ($24 million), mostly due to lower amortization of actuarial losses, as a result of the lower balance sheet net pension and OPEB liability as of December 31, 2015; 
                
    lower wood costs ($16 million), including lower fuel prices and favorable usage; 
                
    better power costs ($15 million), mostly price-related, including a benefit from the reduced power rates on Quebec s north shore to compensate for the higher cost related to processing spruce budworm infested wood; 
                
    lower steam costs ($14 million), mainly due to lower natural gas prices; 
                
    lower recovered paper costs ($9 million); 
                
    higher contribution from our cogeneration assets that sell power externally and our hydroelectric facilities ($7 million); and 
                
    lower wood chip prices ($3 million);

partially offset by: 
             
    higher maintenance costs ($17 million); 
                
    favorable property tax adjustments and the recognition of tax credits in connection with infrastructure investments, in the year-ago period ($15 million); 
                
    unfavorable chemical costs ($8 million); 
                
    higher labor costs ($7 million); and 
                
    write-downs of mill stores and other supplies ($5 million), primarily as a result of the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta mill. 
     Distribution costs 
  After removing the effects of lower volume and the Canadian dollar fluctuation, distribution costs were $9 million lower than in the year-ago period. The decrease is mostly due to lower fuel surcharges, and the expiration of the SLA in October 2015, under which our Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S. had been subject to export duties ($4 million), offset in part by an increase in average length of haul and higher freight rates. 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization was   $19 million   lower in the period, largely reflecting the reduced carrying value of our Catawba paper assets after the $176 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, the net increase of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment, and the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta mill in the second quarter of 2016, offset in part by depreciation and amortization related to the newly acquired Atlas Paper, our new and refurbished sawmills in Ontario and the implementation of our integrated business management software. 
  Closure costs, impairment and other related charges 
  See the corresponding variance analysis under      Segment Earnings   Corporate and Other    below. 
  Net loss   variance analysis 
  Other income, net 
  We recorded other income, net, of   $14 million   in 2016, compared to   $5 million   in the year-ago period. This mostly reflects, in the current period, a $5 million gain on the disposition of our 50% interest in Produits Forestiers Petit-Paris Inc. and a non-cash foreign exchange gain of $3 million on the translation of Canadian dollar net monetary balances, compared mainly to a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $2 million in the year-ago period. 
  Income taxes 
  We recorded an income tax provision of   $9 million   in the period, on a loss before income taxes of   $23 million  , compared to an expected income tax benefit of   $8 million   based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects mostly a   $65 million   valuation allowance related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, partially offset by a $37 million adjustment primarily related to the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations of the applicable jurisdictions, and foreign tax rate differences. 
  In 2015, we recorded an income tax provision of   $22 million  , on a loss before income taxes of   $20 million  , compared to an expected income tax benefit of   $7 million   based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects mainly a   $43 million   valuation allowance primarily related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets and foreign exchange items, offset in part by a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes due to an intercompany asset transfer in connection with an operating company realignment and state and foreign tax rate differences.

Segment Earnings 
  We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers.  
  We do not allocate any of the income or loss items following    operating income (loss)    in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to our segments because those items are reviewed separately by management. Similarly, we do not allocate to the segments: closure costs, impairment and other related charges; inventory write-downs related to closures; start-up costs; gains and losses on disposition of assets; non-operating pension and OPEB costs and credits; as well as other discretionary charges or credits. 
  We allocate depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although the related fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are not allocated to segment assets. Additionally, all selling, general and administrative expenses are allocated to our segments, with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under  corporate and other.

World demand for chemical pulp grew by 3.3% through September, including an increase of 11.2% in China, and reductions of 1.6% and 0.5% in Western Europe and North America, respectively. World capacity grew by 3.6% in that time, mostly reflecting the significant expansion of Latin American hardwood capacity. 
  World demand for softwood was up by 3.6% through September. This reflects increases in shipments of 11.1% and 2.5% to China and North America, respectively, while shipments to Western Europe were down by 1.0%. In the same period, demand for hardwood was up by 3.0%, with shipments to China up by 11.4%, while North America and Western Europe were down by 4.7% and 2.5%, respectively.

  Sales 
  Sales were   $32 million   lower, or   14%  , to   $198 million   in the quarter. The average transaction price dropped by $29 per metric ton due to softer market conditions in North America, with lower market prices across all grades. Shipments were 37,000 metric tons lower, mainly for softwood grades. The decrease in shipments was in large part due to the timing of the annual outage and operating difficulties in Thunder Bay, Ontario. 
  We recorded 10,000 metric tons of downtime in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 25,000 metric tons in the year-ago period. The third quarter of 2015 included more downtime related to production slowback at our recycled bleached kraft (or    RBK   ) mills. 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  COS improved by $10 million in the period. Manufacturing costs increased by $8 million after adjusting for the effects of lower volume and the Canadian dollar fluctuation, mostly reflecting: 
             
    a favorable property tax adjustment in the year-ago period ($4 million); 
                
    higher labor and maintenance costs ($3 million); and 
                
    unfavorable chemical costs ($2 million).

  Sales 
  Sales were   $60 million   lower, or   9%  , to   $619 million   in the first nine months of the year. The average transaction price dropped by $48 per metric ton as a result of lower market prices across all grades, but mostly for softwood. Shipments were 19,000 metric tons lower, mainly for fluff. 
  We recorded 47,000 metric tons of downtime in the first nine months of 2016, compared to 90,000 metric tons in the year-ago period. The 2015 period included the annual maintenance in Saint-F licien, Quebec, which has been deferred to October in 2016, and more downtime related to production slowback at our RBK mills. 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  COS improved by $22 million in the period. Manufacturing costs improved by $1 million after adjusting for the effects of the Canadian dollar fluctuation and the lower volume, reflecting: 
             
    lower fiber costs ($9 million), mostly as a result of favorable sorted office paper prices; 
                
    lower steam costs ($5 million), mainly due to lower natural gas prices; and 
                
    lower wood chip prices ($2 million);

U.S. parent roll production in the period showed only a marginal growth of 1.6% from the previous year. Tissue capacity increased by 2.7%, contributing to a 94% average industry operating rate, 1.2% lower than the year-ago period. 
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 
  Operating loss   analysis 
  During the third quarter of 2016, the tissue segment incurred an operating loss of $5 million. The average transaction price was $1,549 per short ton; sales were $23 million on shipments of 15,000 short tons (14,000 metric tons). We began the integration of RBK pulp in the third quarter of 2016 and expect to complete the integration by the end of the year. 
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 
  Operating loss   analysis 
  During the first nine months of 2016, the tissue segment incurred an operating loss of $11 million. The average transaction price was $1,532 per short ton; sales were $70 million on shipments of 46,000 short tons (42,000 metric tons). COS were $63 million, including $4 million of integration-related costs. We completed the integration of virgin pulp supply with our U.S. pulp network in the first quarter of 2016. 
  The operating results of Atlas Paper were lower than expected. Shipments fell short of set objectives, particularly in converted products sales. Lower productivity on tissue machines and converting lines unfavorably impacted COS, due to reliability and operational issues, as well as high employee turnover. COS were also higher due to one-off integration costs, repairs and maintenance, including reliability-related maintenance costs to bring Atlas Paper s facilities to our safety standards, and higher material usage.

  Sales 
  Sales were   $37 million   higher, or   28%  , to   $168 million   in the third quarter of the year, reflecting a $17 per thousand board feet increase in average transaction price, or 5%, due to the continuing recovery in demand in lumber markets. Shipments were higher by 85 million board feet, reflecting sales from our new sawmills in Northern Ontario and improved productivity for certain sawmills in Quebec, partly offset by lower sales from eight-foot stud sawmills due to lower levels of inventory following downtime taken during the second quarter of 2016. 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  After adjusting for the effects of higher volume and the Canadian dollar fluctuation, manufacturing costs improved by $2 million, mainly reflecting lower fiber costs ($7 million), including lower fuel prices and favorable usage, offset by the recognition of tax credits in the year-ago period, in connection with infrastructure investments ($7 million). 
  Distribution costs 
  Excluding the effect of higher volume, distribution costs were $3 million lower than in the year-ago period, mainly as a result of the expiration of the SLA in October 2015, under which our Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S. had been subject to export duties ($2 million).

  Sales 
  Sales were   $28 million   higher, or   7%  , to   $432 million   in the first nine months of the year. Shipments were higher by 109 million board feet, reflecting sales from our new sawmills in Northern Ontario and improved productivity for certain sawmills in Quebec, largely offset by additional downtime of 48 million board feet compared to the year-ago period, mostly as a result of market conditions, in particular unfavorable pricing for eight-foot stud grades. The average transaction price is lower by only $6 per thousand board feet, or 2%, as the demand in lumber markets continues to recover. 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  After adjusting for the effects of the Canadian dollar fluctuation and higher volume, manufacturing costs increased by $2 million, reflecting: 
             
    the recognition of tax credits in the year-ago period, in connection with infrastructure investments ($7 million); and 
                
    higher labor and maintenance costs ($4 million); 
     offset by lower fiber costs ($11 million), including lower fuel prices and favorable usage. 
  Distribution costs 
  After removing the effects of higher volume and the Canadian dollar fluctuation, distribution costs improved by $3 million compared to the year-ago period, primarily as a result of the expiration of the SLA in October 2015, under which our Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S. had been subject to export duties ($4 million). 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  The lower depreciation and amortization is due to the increase of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment, offset in part by depreciation and amortization related to our new and refurbished sawmills in Ontario.

Industry trends 
  
  North American demand for newsprint fell by 5.2% through September compared to the same period last year, while global demand was down by 4.8%. In response to rising prices in North America, overseas shipments declined by 151,000 metric tons compared to the same period last year. Despite continued declines in demand, the North American operating rate remains in excess of 91% so far in 2016.

  Sales 
  Newsprint sales dropped by   $16 million  , or   6%  , to   $242 million   in the quarter. Shipments were 47,000 metric tons lower, reflecting the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta mill during the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in the reduction of approximately 190,000 metric tons of annual production capacity. The average transaction price rose by $17 per metric ton. 
  Compared to the third quarter of 2015, our domestic and international shipments both fell by 9%. Domestic shipments represented 60% of total newsprint shipments in the period. 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  After removing the effects of lower volume and the Canadian dollar fluctuation, manufacturing costs were unchanged in the period, reflecting: 
             
    lower contribution from our cogeneration assets in Thunder Bay that sell power externally ($3 million); and 
                
    a favorable property tax adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 ($2 million); 
     mostly offset by lower power costs ($4 million), including a benefit from the reduced power rates on Quebec s north shore to compensate for the higher cost related to processing spruce budworm infested wood.

  Sales 
  Newsprint sales dropped by   $82 million  , or   10%  , to   $756 million   in the first nine months of the year, reflecting both a $20 per metric ton drop in average transaction price, including the unfavorable effect of the weaker Canadian dollar on sales denominated in that currency, and a 100,000 metric ton decrease in shipments. The decrease in average transaction price was due to the $45 per metric ton drop in market prices for exports. 
  Compared to the first nine months of 2015, our domestic and international shipments both fell by 6%. Domestic shipments represented 60% of total newsprint shipments in the period. 
  Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs 
  COS were $68 million lower in the period, reflecting the effects of lower volume, the Canadian dollar fluctuation and a $21 million improvement in manufacturing costs, primarily due to: 
             
    lower power costs ($15 million), including a benefit from the reduced power rates on Quebec s north shore to compensate for the higher cost related to processing spruce budworm infested wood; 
                
    lower steam costs ($5 million), mainly due to lower natural gas prices; and 
                
    favorable chemical and recovered paper costs ($4 million); 
     partially offset by a favorable property tax adjustment in 2015 ($4 million). 
  Distribution costs 
  After adjusting for the effects of lower volume and the Canadian dollar fluctuation, distributions costs were $3 million lower primarily due to lower fuel surcharges, offset in part by higher freight rates. 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  The higher depreciation and amortization is due to the decrease of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment, offset in part by the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta mill and the full amortization of certain assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.

  L  IQUIDITY     AND   C  APITAL   R  ESOURCES 
  Capital Resources 
  We rely on cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations, make pension contributions, and finance our working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, from time to time we may use available cash to reduce debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of $  55 million   and availability of   $465 million   under our revolving credit facilities. 
  In our view, we have sufficient financial resources available to finance our business plan, meet working capital requirements and maintain an appropriate level of capital spending. 
  Senior Secured Credit Facility 
  On September 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (or    Senior Secured Credit Facility   ) for up to   $185 million  . The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a term loan of   $46 million   with a maturity date of September 7, 2025 (or    Term Loan   ), a revolving credit facility of up to   $139 million   with a maturity date of September 7, 2022 (or    Revolving Credit Facility   ), and also provides an uncommitted option to increase the Senior Secured Credit Facility by up to   $175 million  , subject to certain terms and conditions. 
  The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a first priority mortgage on the real property of our Calhoun, Tennessee, facility and a first priority security interest on the fixtures and equipment located therein. 
  Interest rates under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are based, at the Company s election, on either a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (or    LIBOR   ), or a base rate, in each case plus a spread over the index. The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.5%  ; and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus   1%  . The applicable spread over the index fluctuates quarterly based upon the Company s capitalization ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the Company s funded indebtedness to the sum of the Company s funded indebtedness and its net worth. For the Term Loan, the initial applicable spread is   1%   for base rate loans and   2%   for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from   0.875%   to   1.5%   for base rate loans, and from   1.875%   to   2.5%   for LIBOR rate loans. For loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the initial applicable spread is   0.625%   for base rate loans and   1.625%   for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from   0.5%   to   1.125%   for base rate loans, and from   1.5%   to   2.125%   for LIBOR rate loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was issued by eight lenders within the farm credit system and will be eligible for patronage refunds. Patronage refunds are distributions of profits from lenders in the farm credit system, which are cooperatives that are required to distribute profits to  
  
   52 

     Table of Contents  

their members. Patronage distributions, which are made in either cash or stock, are received in the year after they were earned. Future refunds will be dependent on future farm credit lender profits, made at the discretion of each farm credit lender. 
  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to pay a fee in respect of unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility equal to   0.325%   per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to   35%   of the total revolving commitments, and   0.275%   per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is greater than   35%   of the total revolving commitments. The fee for unutilized commitments will be   0.325%   per annum initially. 
  Base rate loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be repaid from time to time at our discretion without premium or penalty. LIBOR rate loans may be repaid from time to time at our discretion, subject to breakage costs, if any. Amounts repaid on the Term Loan may not be subsequently re-borrowed. Principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn, repaid, and redrawn until September 6, 2022. 
  Pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are also required to maintain a capitalization ratio not greater than   45%   at all times, available liquidity of not less than   $100 million  , and a collateral coverage ratio of not less than   1.8   to 1.0 (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence and repayment of indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of liens; (iv) restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries making certain restricted payments; (v) restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations, and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to material indebtedness. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties, and, subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, also contains certain customary events of default. 
  Flow of Funds 
  Summary of cash flows 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 
  Net cash provided by operating activities 
  We generated   $51 million   of cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2016, compared to   $90 million   in the year-ago period. The decrease is attributable to a reduction in profitability and higher pension contributions mostly related to a previously disclosed supplemental contribution in 2016. 
  Net cash used in investing activities 
  Cash used in investing activities, up $61 million against the year-ago period, consisted mostly of cash invested in fixed assets, which reflects investments in strategic projects such as: the tissue manufacturing and converting facility in Calhoun, for which $110 million was spent in 2016; and the implementation of our integrated business management software. Approximately $120 million of capital expenditures remains to be spent to complete the $270 million Calhoun tissue project. The current period also included countervailing duty cash deposits of   $17 million  , offset by a consideration of   $5 million   received from the disposition of our 50% interest in Produits Forestiers Petit-Paris Inc.

     Table of Contents  

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
  We borrowed $136 million under our credit facilities in the first nine months of 2016, to sustain the capital expenditures for our continued transformation strategy. In the same period of 2015, we used $62 million in financing activities, almost all of which related to share repurchases. 
  Based on borrowings of $136 million for the first nine months of 2016 and expected capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2016 for our continued transformation strategy, we now expect to borrow approximately $170 million in aggregate in 2016. 
  Countervailing duty cash deposit requirements 
  Since October 20, 2015, we have been required to make cash deposits at a subsidy rate of 17.87% for estimated and projected countervailing duties on SC papers we import to the U.S. from our Canadian mills. Based on our current operating parameters, the cash deposits could be as high as $25 million per year. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have made   $21 million   of cash deposits. For additional information, see Item 1A,  Risk Factors   We are subject to countervailing duty trade remedies on exports of our SC paper to the U.S., which could adversely affect our operations and cash flows,  of the 2015 Annual Report.

    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     Information on our legal proceedings is presented under Part I, Item 3,  Legal Proceedings,  in our   2015   Annual Report. Except as otherwise provided hereafter, there have been no material changes to the legal proceedings described in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Effective January 1, 2015, we modified our U.S. OPEB plan so that unionized participants, upon reaching Medicare eligibility, are provided Medicare coverage via a Medicare Exchange program rather than via a Company-sponsored medical plan. On March 2, 2016, a proposed class action lawsuit (  Reynolds, et al v. Resolute Forest Products Inc., Resolute FP US Inc., Resolute FP US Health and Resolute Welfare Benefit Plan  ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of certain Medicare-eligible retirees who were previously unionized employees of our Calhoun, Tennessee; Catawba, South Carolina; and Coosa Pines, Alabama, mills, and their spouses and dependents. The plaintiffs allege that the modifications described above breach the collective bargaining agreements and plan covering the members of the proposed class in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the health care benefits as in effect before January 1, 2015, for the proposed class in the lawsuit. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to defend the action. On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The proposed class action lawsuit is at a preliminary stage and no class has been certified. Accordingly, we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter or to reasonably estimate the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  On June 23, 2016, Environment Canada charged our subsidiary, Fibrek s.e.n.c., with alleged violations of Sections 36(3) and 38(4) of the   Fisheries Act   (Canada), which prohibit the deposit or discharge of deleterious substances in water frequented by fish, and require reporting of an irregular discharge, or a serious and imminent risk of an irregular discharge, which results, or could reasonably be expected to result, in detriment to fish, fish habitat, or human use of fish. The charges are based on discharges of effluent in the Mistassini and Ashuapmushan rivers alleged to have occurred at our Saint-F licien, Quebec, pulp mill between January 2012 and October 2013, before and shortly after we acquired control of Fibrek s.e.n.c. on May 2, 2012. Environment Canada has not yet disclosed to us the specific occurrences of the events alleged to have violated Sections 36(3) and 38(4) of the   Fisheries Act   (Canada) that will be relied upon, nor the amount of any fine or other remedy that may be sought. The proceeding will be heard by the Court of Quebec (  Cour du Qu bec  ). Although we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this proceeding, we believe it will not have a material impact on the Company.

The Relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telecopy or electronic transmission of any prepayment of the Loans hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment and (ii) in the case of prepayment of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment.  Each notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable, except that such Borrower may, by subsequent notice to the Administrative Agent, revoke any such notice of prepayment if such notice of revocation is received not later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the day on which such prepayment is scheduled to occur and,   provided   that (i) such Borrower reimburses each Lender pursuant to   Section 3.02   for any funding losses within five Business Days after receiving written demand therefor and (ii) the amount of Loans as to which such revocation applies shall be deemed converted to (or continued as, as applicable) Base Rate Loans in accordance with the provisions of   Section 2.08   as of the date of notice of revocation (subject to subsequent conversion in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement).  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in   Section 2.02  , except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by   Section 2.06  . 
   
  2.10.        Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs  . 
  (a)        Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Credit Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of amounts payable under   Sections 3.01  ,   3.02   and   5.01   or otherwise) at or before the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Credit Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in U.S. Dollars in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after the required time on any date may, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office, except that payments pursuant to   Sections 3.01  ,   3.02  ,   5.01   and   13.01   shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Credit Documents shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Persons specified therein.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the  
  
   39 

appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Credit Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. 
  (b)        If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied in the manner as provided in   Section 2.09(c)   or   11.11   hereof, as applicable, ratably among the parties entitled thereto. 
  (c)        If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or portion of the Term Loan resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and its portion of the Term Loan and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and the Term Loan of other applicable Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and portion of the Term Loan;   provided   that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including, but not limited to,   Section 13.12  ) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or Affiliate thereof or any Subsidiary of the Company (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Credit Parties rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of a Credit Party in the amount of such participation. 
  (d)        Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due under the applicable Facility to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders under the applicable Facility, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
  (e)        If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to   Section 2.02(c)  ,   2.02(f)  ,   2.10(d)  , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the  
  
   40 

Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 
   
  2.11.        Defaulting Lenders  . 
  (a)        Reallocation of Pro Rata Share; Amendments  .  For purposes of determining the Lenders  obligations to fund or acquire participations in Loans, the Administrative Agent shall exclude the Commitments and Loans of any Defaulting Lender(s) from the calculation of Pro Rata Shares.  A Defaulting Lender shall have no right to vote on any amendment, waiver or other modification of a Credit Document, except to the limited extent provided in   Section 13.12  .  In no event shall any Lender s obligations pursuant to this   Section 2.11(a)   cause such Lender to exceed its aggregate Commitment. 
  (b)        Payments; Fees  .  The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, receive and retain any amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender under the Credit Documents, and a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned to the Administrative Agent such amounts until all Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent, Non-Defaulting Lenders and other Secured Creditors have been paid in full.  The Administrative Agent may apply such amounts to the Defaulting Lender s defaulted obligations or readvance the amounts to the Company hereunder.  A Lender shall not be entitled to receive any fees accruing hereunder during the period in which it is a Defaulting Lender, and the unfunded portion of its Commitment shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the Unused Line Fee under   Section 2.05(a)  . 
  (c)        Cure  .  The Company and Administrative Agent may agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender.  At such time, Pro Rata Shares shall be reallocated without exclusion of such Lender s Commitments and Loans, and all outstanding Loans and other exposures under the Commitments shall be reallocated among Lenders and settled by the Administrative Agent (with appropriate payments by the reinstated Lender) in accordance with the readjusted Pro Rata Shares.  Unless expressly agreed in writing by the Company and Administrative Agent, no reinstatement of a Defaulting Lender shall constitute a waiver or release of claims against such Lender.  The failure of any Lender to fund a Loan or otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations, and no Lender shall be responsible for default by another Lender. 
   
  2.12.        [Reserved]  . 
   
  2.13.        Commitment Increases  . 
  (a)        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, after the Closing Date, the Company shall have the right to request, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) an increase in the Revolving Commitments (a    Revolving Commitment Increase   ), (ii) an increase in the aggregate amount of the Term Loan and/or the addition of a separate term loan facility (an    Additional Term Loan Facility   ) (each such increase or separate facility pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), an    Accordion Increase   ) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $175,000,000;   provided   that (x) any Accordion Increase shall be on the terms (including, in the case of a Revolving Commitment Increase or increase in the aggregate amount of the Term Loan, the Latest Maturity Date) and pursuant to the documentation to be agreed upon by the Lenders providing such Accordion Increase, (y) the Company shall only be permitted to request two Accordion Increases during the term of this Agreement and (z) any Accordion Increase shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 or, if less than $25,000,000     is available, the amount left available. 
  
   41 

(b)        Each notice submitted pursuant to this   Section 2.13   (an    Accordion Increase Notice   ) requesting an Accordion Increase shall specify the amount of the increase in the Revolving Commitments or the Term Loan or the amount of the new term loan being requested.  Upon receipt of an Accordion Increase Notice, the Administrative Agent may (at the direction of the Company) promptly notify the applicable Lenders and each such Lender may (subject to the Company s consent) have the right to elect to (x) have its Revolving Commitment or Term Loan Commitment increased by its Pro Rata Share (it being understood and agreed that a Lender may elect to have its Revolving Commitment or Term Loan Commitment increased in excess of its Pro Rata Share in its discretion if any other Lender declines to participate in the Accordion Increase) of the requested increase in Revolving Commitments or Term Loan Commitments, as applicable or (y) issue a commitment under the Additional Term Loan Facility;   provided   that (i) each Lender may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to participate in any Accordion Increase, it being understood that no Lender shall be obligated to participate in an Accordion Increase unless it, in its sole discretion, so agrees and, if a Lender fails to respond to any Accordion Increase Notice within five (5) Business Days after such Lender s receipt of such request, such Lender shall be deemed to have declined to participate in such Accordion Increase; (ii) if any Lender declines to participate in any Accordion Increase and, as a result, commitments from additional financial institutions are required in connection with the Accordion Increase, any Person or Persons providing such commitment shall be subject to the written consent of the Administrative Agent (in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (iii) in no event shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to participate in such Accordion Increase; (iv) neither the funding of the Accordion Increase nor the existence of the Liens securing such Accordion Increase would violate the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture.  In the event that any Lender or other Person agrees to participate in any Accordion Increase (each an    Increase Loan Lender   ), such Accordion Increase shall become effective on such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Increase Loan Lenders and the Company, which date shall be as soon as practicable after the date of receipt of the Accordion Increase Notice (such date, the    Increase Date      provided   that the establishment of such Accordion Increase shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:  (1) no Default or Event of Default would exist after giving effect thereto; (2) the Accordion Increase shall be effected pursuant to one or more joinder agreements executed and delivered by the Company, the Administrative Agent, and the Increase Loan Lenders, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Administrative Agent, and the Increase Loan Lenders; (3) the Credit Parties shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent such amendments to the Credit Documents, legal opinions and other documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with any such transaction, which amendments, legal opinions and other documents shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; (4) the representations and warranties contained in   Section 8   shall be true and correct in all material respects (or in all respects to the extent that any representation or warranty is qualified by materiality) as of the Increase Date; (5) the Borrowers shall have paid to the Administrative Agent and the Increase Loan Lenders such additional fees as may be agreed to be paid by the Borrowers in connection therewith; and (6) the Company shall be in compliance with the Collateral Coverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Accordion Increase. 
  (c)        On the Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in this   Section 2.13  , (i) with respect to any Revolving Commitment Increase, the Administrative Agent shall effect a settlement of all outstanding Revolving Loans among the Lenders that will reflect the adjustments to the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders as a result of the Revolving Commitment Increase, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders and Credit Parties of the occurrence of the Accordion Increase to be effected on the Increase Date, (iii)   Schedule 2.01   shall be deemed modified to reflect the revised and/or new Commitments of the affected Lenders and (iv) Notes will be issued,  
  
   42 

at the expense of the Borrowers, to any Lender participating in the Accordion Increase and requesting a Note. 
  (d)        The terms and provisions of (x) the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be identical to the Revolving Loans and the Revolving Commitments and, for purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, all Revolving Loans made under the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be deemed to be Revolving Loans and (y) any Accordion Increase to the existing Term Loan Facility (other than an Additional Term Loan Facility) shall be identical to the Term Loan and the Term Loan Commitments and, each loan made in connection with an Accordion Increase to the existing Term Loan Facility (other than an Additional Term Loan Facility) shall constitute an increase to the existing Term Loan hereunder.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  
  (i)        With respect to any Revolving Commitment Increase, (A) the rate of interest applicable to the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be the same as the rate of interest applicable to the existing Revolving Loans, (B) unused line fees applicable to the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be calculated using the same Unused Line Fee Rates applicable to the existing Revolving Loans, (C) the Revolving Commitment Increase shall share ratably in any mandatory prepayments of the Revolving Loans, (D) after giving effect to such Revolving Commitment Increases, Revolving Commitments shall be reduced based on each Lender s Pro Rata Percentage, and (E) the Revolving Commitment Increase shall rank   pari     passu   in right of payment and security with the existing Revolving Loans.   
  (ii)        With respect to any increase to the existing Term Loan, (A) the rate of interest applicable to such Accordion Increase shall be the same as the rate of interest applicable to the existing Term Loan, (B) such Accordion Increase shall share ratably in any mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan, (C) after giving effect to such Accordion Increase, the Term Commitments shall be reduced based on each Lender s Pro Rata Percentage, and (D) such Accordion Increase shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the existing Term Loan.   
  (iii)        With respect to any Additional Term Loan Facility, (A) the Company and each Increase Loan Lender providing an Additional Term Loan Facility shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Additional Term Loan Facility Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the commitment of such Increase Loan Lender, (B) the Additional Term Loan Facility Agreement shall specify the pricing, maturity date and other terms of the Additional Term Loan Facility, (C) the final maturity date of the Additional Term Loan Facility shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date for the existing Term Loan, (D) the weighted average life to maturity of the Additional Term Loan Facility shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loan and other existing Additional Term Loan Facility, (E) the Additional Term Loan Facility shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the existing Term Loan, and (F) the other terms and documentation in respect of the Additional Term Loan Facility, to the extent not consistent with the existing Term Loan, shall be as agreed between the Company and the Increase Loan Lenders providing the Additional Term Loan Facility (but in any case subject to the specific limitations and requirements set forth above) and the Administrative Agent. 
  
   43 

(iv)        Each joinder agreement and any amendment to any Credit Document requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with the establishment of an Accordion Increase may, without the consent of any of the Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement (each, an    Accordion Agreement   ) and the other Credit Documents as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Company, to effect the provisions of this   Section 2.13  . 
   
  2.14.        Subsidiary Borrowers  . 
  (a)        The Company may at any time, upon not less than 10 Business Days  notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), designate any one or more Domestic Subsidiaries  of the Company (an    Applicant Borrower   ) as a Borrower to receive Loans hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form of   Exhibit I   (a    Borrower Designation Request and Assumption Agreement   ).  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the credit facilities provided for herein the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received such supporting resolutions, constitutional documents, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel, Security Documents, valuations and other documents, instruments or information (including any  know-your-customer  information requested by the Administrative Agent, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their sole discretion, and Notes signed by such new Borrowers to the extent any Lenders so require.  If the Administrative Agent agrees that an Applicant Borrower shall have satisfied all of the requirements of this   Section 2.14   and, therefore, be entitled to receive Loans hereunder, then promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency certificates, Security Documents, opinions of counsel and other documents, instruments or information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of   Exhibit H   (a    Borrower Designation Notice   ) to the Company and the Lenders specifying the effective date upon which the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Borrower, whereupon each of the Lenders agrees to permit such Applicant Borrower to become a Borrower and to receive Loans hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and each of the parties agrees that such Applicant Borrower otherwise shall be a Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement;   provided   that no Notice of Borrowing may be submitted by or on behalf of such Applicant Borrower until the date three Business Days after such effective date. 
  (b)        The Company may from time to time, upon not less than 10 Business Days  notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate any Domestic Subsidiary s status as a Borrower;   provided   that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Borrower or other amounts payable by such Borrower on account of any Credit Extensions made to it, as of the effective date of such termination (unless such Loans and other Obligations have been assumed by another Borrower).  Following the termination of any Subsidiary s status as a Borrower hereunder, such Subsidiary shall, subject to the terms of   Section 9.16  , remain a Subsidiary Guarantor and shall remain subject to the terms of this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such termination of a Subsidiary Borrower s status. 
   
  Section 3        Yield Protection, Illegality and Replacement of Lenders  . 
  
   44 

3.01.        Increased Costs, Illegality, etc  . 
  (a)        In the event that any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent): 
  (i)        on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of  LIBOR Rate  
  (ii)        at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan because of any change since the Closing Date in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the official interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, official guideline or request, such as, but not limited to:  (A) any Tax imposed on any Lender (except Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnified under   Section 5.01   or any Excluded Taxes) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the LIBOR Rate; or 
  (iii)        at any time, that the making or continuance of any LIBOR Rate Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in good faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of law) or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank Eurodollar market; 
  then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice in writing to the Company and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders).  Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Rate Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by the Relevant Borrower with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by the applicable Borrowers, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, each Borrower, jointly and severally, agrees to pay, to such Lender, upon such Lender s written request therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a written notice setting forth the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, shall be submitted to the Company by such Lender and shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto), (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrowers shall take one of the actions specified in   Section 3.01(b)   as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law. 
  (b)        At any time that any LIBOR Rate Loan is affected by the circumstances described in   Section 3.01(a)(ii)  , the Relevant Borrower may, and in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan affected  
  
   45 

by the circumstances described in   Section 3.01(a)(iii)  , the Relevant Borrower shall either (x) if the affected LIBOR Rate Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel such Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent written notice on the same date that the Relevant Borrower was notified by the affected Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to   Section 3.01(a)(ii)   or   (iii)   or (y) if the affected LIBOR Rate Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days  written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert such LIBOR Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period, or such earlier date as may be required by applicable law,   provided   that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this   Section 3.01(b)  . 
  (c)        If any Lender determines that after the Closing Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy or liquidity, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by the NAIC or any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender s Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then, each Borrower, jointly and severally, agrees to pay to such Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital or liquidity.  In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable,   provided   that such Lender s determination of compensation owing under this   Section 3.01(c)   shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.  Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this   Section 3.01(c)  , will give prompt written notice thereof to the Company, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts. 
  (d)        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III ((x) and (y) collectively referred to as    Dodd-Frank and Basel III   ), shall be deemed to be a change after the Closing Date in a Requirement of Law or government rule, regulation or order, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented (including for purposes of this   Section 3.01  ). 
  (e)        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section (i) for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender s intention to claim compensation under this   Section 3.01  ;   provided  ,   however  , that, if the introduction or change referred to in   Section 3.01(a)(ii)   or   3.01(c)   giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof; or (ii) such Lender is not charging such costs or reduced return to its borrowers generally with respect to which it has the right to charge such costs. 
  
   46 

(f)        Cost of Funds True-Up  . The Borrowers acknowledge that the LIBOR Rate may not represent the true cost of funds incurred by the Lenders in connection with making LIBOR Rate Loans under the Term Loan available to the Borrowers. In recognition of the foregoing, the Borrowers agree that, if the Current Cost of Funds (as defined below) for the seven (7) day period ending on each of the third and sixth anniversaries of the Closing Date (each a    Reset Date   ) differs from the Closing Date Cost of Funds (as defined below) by more than 15 basis points (in either direction), the Administrative Agent shall have the right, in the case of an increase in the Current Cost of Funds from the Closing Date Cost of Funds, and the obligation, in the case of a decrease in the Current Cost of Funds from the Closing Date Cost of Funds, to adjust the LIBOR Rate applicable to the Term Loan by 100% of the number of basis points by which the Current Cost of Funds differs from the Closing Date Cost of Funds, which increase or decrease shall remain in effect until the earlier of (x) the next Reset Date and (y) repayment in full of all Obligations with respect to the Term Loan Facility.  As used herein: 
  (x)       Closing Date Cost of Funds    means 18     basis points, which is the difference between (A) the all-in LIBOR Floating Note Rate cost of funds paid by the Farm Credit Lenders as indicated by the Farm Credit Funding Corporation and (B) the one-month LIBOR Rate as of the Closing Date. 
  (y)       Current Cost of Funds    means, as of any Reset Date, the difference, if any, between the average all-in LIBOR Floating Note Rate cost of funds paid by the Farm Credit Lenders as indicated by the Farm Credit Funding Corporation for the seven (7) day period ending on such Reset Date and the average one-month LIBOR Rate for such seven (7) day period. 
  (z)        LIBOR Floating Note Rate    means, as of any date, the estimated funding cost (not the actual sale price), including standard underwriting fees, for new 3-year floating rate farm credit debt securities issued into the primary market based on market observations on such date indicated at approximately 9:30 a.m. Eastern time;   provided   that such indications represent the Farm Credit Funding Corporation's best estimate of the cost of new debt issues based on a combination of daily surveys of selected farm credit selling group members (participating bond dealers) and ongoing monitoring of the fixed income markets for actual, recent, primary market issuance by other government-sponsored of similar bonds and notes and pricing within related derivative markets, particularly the interest rate swap market. Historical information on such funding costs is available, for the prior week, on the Farm Credit Funding Corporation s website (   http://www.farmcreditfunding.com/ffcb_live/fundingCostIndex.html   ) under the  Output  tab of the most recent spreadsheet.  
   
  3.02.        Compensation  .

If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

  (b)        to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under   Sections 2.05   and   13.01  .

  (ii)        at the request of the Company, to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent under any Credit Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by   Section 10.01 (vii)   and   (xiv)   but only to the extent such sections permit such Lien to be prior to the Liens held by the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent under the Credit Documents; and 
  (iii)        to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Credit Party Guaranty if such Person (1) becomes an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Immaterial Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is a Guarantor under the ABL Credit Facility) in accordance with the terms hereof or (2) ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder. 
  Upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s or the Collateral Agent s, as applicable, authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Credit Party Guaranty pursuant to this   Section 12.11  .

In this capacity, the Administrative Agent, as  collateral agent  and any agent, employee or attorney-in-fact appointed by the  collateral agent  pursuant to   Section 12.02   for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the  collateral agent,  shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this   Section 12   and   Section 13   as though such agent, employee or attorney-in-fact were the  collateral agent  under the Credit Documents, as set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 
   
  12.14.        Withholding Taxes  .  To the extent required by any applicable laws (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Credit Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  Without limiting or expanding the provisions of   Section 5.01  , each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective).  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Credit Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this   Section 12.14  .  The agreements in this   Section 12.14   shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

  (b)        A Lender may assign to an Eligible Assignee any of its rights and obligations under the Credit Documents, as long as (a) in the case of a partial assignment, is in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by Administrative Agent in its discretion) and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount; (b) except in the case of an assignment in whole of a Lender s rights and obligations, the aggregate amount of the Commitments retained by the transferor Lender is at least $5,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Company in their discretion); and (c) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and recording.  Nothing herein shall limit the right of a Lender to pledge or assign any rights under the Credit Documents to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank or the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation;   provided  ,   however  , that no such pledge or assignment shall release the Lender from its obligations hereunder nor substitute the pledge or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

The Administrative Agent has no obligation to determine whether any assignee is permitted under the Credit Documents.

Entries in the register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and Lenders shall treat each Person recorded in such register as a Lender for all purposes under the Credit Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  The Administrative Agent may choose to show only one Borrower as the borrower in the register, without any effect on the liability of any Credit Party with respect to the Obligations.  The register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender, from time to time upon reasonable notice. 
  (f)        Subject to this   Section 13.04  , any Lender may sell to an Eligible Assignee (in such context, a    Participant   ) a participating interest in the rights and obligations of such Lender under any Credit Documents.  Despite any sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender s obligations under the Credit Documents shall remain unchanged, it shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for performance of such obligations, it shall remain the holder of its Loans and Commitments for all purposes, all amounts payable by the Borrowers shall be determined as if it had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the Credit Documents.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for notifying its Participants of any matters under the Credit Documents, and the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall not have any obligation or liability to any such Participant.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits under this Agreement as though it were a Lender;   provided   that such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.10   as though it were a Lender. 
  (h)        A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Sections 3.01  ,   3.02   or   5.01   than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant except to the extent such entitlement to a greater payment results from a change in law occurring after the sale of the participation takes place. 
  (i)        Subject to   Section 13.04(l)  , each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, waiver or other modification of a Credit Document

other than that which forgives principal, interest or fees, reduces the stated interest rate or fees payable with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest, postpones any relevant Maturity Date or any date fixed for any regularly scheduled payment of principal, interest or fees on such Loan or Commitment, or releases any Borrower, Guarantor or substantially all Collateral. 
  (j)        Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (solely for Tax purposes), maintain a register (the    Participant Register   ) in which it enters the Participant s name, address and interest in Commitments and Loans (and stated interest).  Entries in the register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person recorded in the register as the owner of the participation for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  No Lender shall have an obligation to disclose any information in such register except to the extent necessary to establish that a Participant s interest is in registered form under the Code. 
  (k)        Borrowers agree that each Participant shall have a right of setoff in respect of its participating interest to the same extent as if such interest were owing directly to a Lender, and each Lender shall also retain the right of setoff with respect to any participating interests sold by it.  By exercising any right of setoff, a Participant agrees to share with Lenders all amounts received through its setoff, in accordance with   Section 2.10(c)   as if such Participant were a Lender. 
  (l)        Notwithstanding anything in   Section 13.04   to the contrary, any Farm Credit Lender that (a) has purchased a participation or sub-participation in the Loans in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 on or after the Closing Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Company and Administrative Agent (   Voting Participant Notification   ), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a    Voting Participant   ) and (c) receives the prior written consent of the Company and Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant (to the extent such consent would be required pursuant to   Section 13.04(b)   if such transfer were an assignment rather than a sale of a participation or sub-participation), shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action.  To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an assignee as set forth in   Exhibit F   hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation or sub-participation purchased.  The Company and Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each bank or other lending institution that is a member of the Farm Credit System designated as a Voting Participant in   Schedule 13.04(l)   hereto shall be a Voting Participant without delivery of a Voting Participant Notification and without the prior written consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent.  The voting rights of each Voting Participant are solely for the benefit of such Voting Participant and shall not inure to any assignee or participant of such Voting Participant that is not otherwise a Voting Participant. 
   
  13.05.        No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative  .  No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrowers or any other Credit Party and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document  
  
   102 

preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.  The rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender would otherwise have.  No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

  (a)        The financial statements to be furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect from time to time;   provided   that if the Company notifies the Administrative Agent that it requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith.  The Company shall have the right, if required by relevant regulatory authorities, to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards, as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (or any successor board or agency), as in effect on the date of the election, which election shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be treated as a permitted change in GAAP and shall be subject to the terms of the immediately preceding sentence.  Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 141R or ASC 805 (or any other financial accounting standard having a similar result or effect). 
  (b)        The calculation of any financial ratios under this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-down if there is no nearest number). 
   
  13.08.        GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL  . 
  (a)        UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT, THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND ALL CLAIMS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES EXCEPT FEDERAL LAWS RELATING TO NATIONAL BANKS. 
  (b)        EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTRY OR THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, IN ANY DISPUTE, ACTION, LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY CREDIT DOCUMENTS, AND AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE, ACTION,  
  
   103

EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN   SECTION 13.03  .  A final judgment in any proceeding of any such court shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or any other manner provided by applicable law. 
  (c)        EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. 
   
  13.09.        Counterparts  .

  13.12.        Amendment or Waiver; etc  . 
  (a)        Neither this Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or termination is in writing signed by the Credit Parties party hereto or thereto and the Required Lenders (although additional parties may be added to (and annexes may be modified to reflect such additions) the Security Documents in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof without the consent of the other Credit Parties party thereto or the Required Lenders);   provided   that no such change, waiver, discharge or termination shall (i) without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, extend any Maturity Date, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon or reduce or forgive the principal amount thereof or forgive the payment of such interest or Fees (it being understood that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, mandatory prepayments, Defaults or Events of Default shall not constitute a reduction or extension of the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon of any Lender), (ii) except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Security Documents, release all or substantially all of the Collateral under all the Security Documents without the prior written consent of each Lender, (iii) except as otherwise provided in the Credit Documents, release all or substantially all of the value of the Credit Party Guaranty without the prior written consent of each Lender, (iv) amend, modify or waive any pro rata sharing provision of   Section 2.10  , the payment waterfall provision of   Section 11.11  , or any provision of this   Section 13.12(a)   (except for technical amendments with respect to additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement which afford the protections to such additional extensions of credit of the type provided to the Commitments on the Closing Date),  
  
   104 

in each case, without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (v) reduce the percentage specified in the definitions of  Required Lenders  without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (it being understood that, with the prior written consent of the Required Lenders additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the extensions of Commitments are included on the Closing Date), (vi) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each Lender;   provided  ,   further  , that no such change, waiver, discharge or termination shall (1) increase the Commitments of any Lender over the amount thereof then in effect without the consent of such Lender (it being understood that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or Events of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not constitute an increase of the Commitment of any Lender, and that an increase in the available portion of any Commitment of any Lender shall not constitute an increase of the Commitment of such Lender), (2) without the consent of each Agent adversely affected thereby, amend, modify or waive any provision of   Section 12   or any other provision as same relates to the rights or obligations of such Agent, (3) without the consent of Collateral Agent, amend, modify or waive any provision relating to the rights or obligations of the Collateral Agent.

  (c)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause (a) of this   Section 13.12  , the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Lender providing the relevant Accordion Increase may, in accordance with the provisions of   Section 2.13  , enter into an Accordion Agreement or Additional Term Loan Facility Agreement;   provided   that after the execution and delivery by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each such Lender may thereafter only be modified in accordance with the requirements of clause (a) above of this   Section 13.12  . 
  (d)        Without the consent of any other person, the applicable Credit Party or Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent may (in its or their respective sole discretion, or shall, to the extent required by any Credit Document) enter into any amendment or waiver of any Credit Document, or enter into any new agreement or instrument, to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or additional property

  (f)        Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such period as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender will not be entitled to vote in respect of amendments, waivers and consents hereunder and the Commitment and the outstanding Loans or other extensions of credit of such Lender hereunder will not be taken into account in determining whether the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as required, have approved any such amendment, waiver or consent (and the definition of  Required Lenders  will automatically be deemed modified accordingly for the duration of such period);   provided   that any such amendment or waiver that would increase or extend the term of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, extend the date fixed for the payment of principal or interest owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, reduce the principal amount of any obligation owing to such Defaulting Lender, reduce the amount of or the rate or amount of interest on any amount owing to such Defaulting Lender or of any fee payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or alter the terms of this proviso, will require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
  (g)        Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Section 13.12  , if following the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent and any Credit Party shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Credit Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Credit Documents if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within five (5) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.

  13.14.        Domicile of Loans  .  Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans at, to or for the account of any office, branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender.

The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to   Section 13.04(b)  .

The registration of any provision of Accordion Increases pursuant to   Section 2.13   shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance of the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Accordion Agreement or Additional Term Loan Facility Agreement, as applicable.  Coincident with the delivery of such Accordion Agreement for acceptance and registration of the provision of Accordion Increases, as the case may be, or as soon thereafter as practicable, to the extent requested by such Lenders, Notes shall be issued, at the Borrowers  expense, to such Lender of an Accordion Increase, to be in conformity with   Section 2.04   (with appropriate modification) to the extent needed to reflect Accordion Increases, and outstanding Loans made by such Lender of an Accordion Increase.

  14.01.        The Guaranty  .  In order to induce the Agents, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder, and to induce the other Guaranteed Creditors to enter into Secured Hedging Obligations in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by each Credit Party from the proceeds of the Loans and the entering into of such Secured Hedging Obligations, each Credit Party hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors as follows:  each Credit Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all of its Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors.  If any or all of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of any Credit Party to the Guaranteed Creditors becomes due and payable hereunder, such Credit Party, unconditionally and irrevocably, promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent and/or the other Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, together with any and all expenses which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed Creditors in collecting any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations.  This Credit Party Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.  This Credit Party Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon.  If claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Creditor for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and any of the aforesaid payees repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any of its property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such payee with any such claimant (including any Relevant Guaranteed Party), then and in such event the respective Credit Party agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon such Credit Party, notwithstanding any revocation of this Credit Party Guaranty or any other instrument evidencing any liability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, and each Credit Party shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such payee. 
   
  14.02.        Bankruptcy  .  Additionally, each Credit Party unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all of its Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors whether or not due or payable by any Relevant Guaranteed Party upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in   Section 11.05  , and irrevocably and unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, in the currency in which the obligation was originally denominated. 
   
  14.03.        Nature of Liability  .  The liability of each Credit Party hereunder is primary, absolute and unconditional, exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, whether executed by any other guarantor or by any other party, and each Credit Party understands and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted under law, that the liability of such Credit Party hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by any Relevant Guaranteed Party or by any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking (other than payment in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations), or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by any Relevant Guaranteed Party, or (e) any payment made to any Guaranteed Creditor on the Relevant Guaranteed  
  
   109 

Obligations which any such Guaranteed Creditor repays to any Relevant Guaranteed Party pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, winding up or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Credit Party waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, or (f) any action or inaction by the Guaranteed Creditors as contemplated in   Section 14.05  , or (g) any invalidity, irregularity or enforceability of all or any part of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor, or (h) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Credit Party or any other Person liable for any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, or (i) any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, winding up or other debtor relief proceeding affecting any Credit Party, or their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Credit Party, or (j) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which any Credit Party may have at any time against any other Credit Party, a Guaranteed Creditor, or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions, or (k) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, a Credit Party in respect of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or a Credit Party in respect of this Credit Party Guaranty or the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. 
   
  14.04.        Independent Obligation  .  The obligations of each Credit Party hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor, any other party or any Relevant Guaranteed Party, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against any Credit Party whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor, any other party or any Relevant Guaranteed Party and whether or not any other guarantor, any other party or any Relevant Guaranteed Party be joined in any such action or actions.  Each Credit Party waives, in its capacity as a Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof.  Any payment by any Relevant Guaranteed Party or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to such Relevant Guaranteed Party shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to the relevant Credit Party. 
   
  14.05.        Authorization  .  To the fullest extent permitted under law, each Credit Party authorizes the Guaranteed Creditors without notice or demand, and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to: 
  (a)        change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest or fees thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Credit Party Guaranty shall apply to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered; 
  (b)        take and hold security for the payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset there against; 
  (c)        exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other Credit Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting; 
  (d)        release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, any Relevant Guaranteed Party, other Credit Parties or other obligors; 
  
   110 

(e)        settle or compromise any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to its creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors; 
  (f)        apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of such Relevant Guaranteed Party remain unpaid; 
  (g)        consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Secured Hedging Obligations or any of the instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Secured Hedging Obligations or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or 
  (h)        take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of such Credit Party from its liabilities under this Credit Party Guaranty. 
   
  14.06.        Reliance  .  It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Relevant Guaranteed Party or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Relevant Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder. 
   
  14.07.        Subordination  .  Any indebtedness of any Relevant Guaranteed Party now or hereafter owing to any Credit Party is hereby subordinated to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to such Credit Party shall be collected, enforced and received by such Credit Party for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of any Credit Party under the other provisions of this Credit Party Guaranty.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Credit Party hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Credit Party Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash. 
   
  14.08.        Waiver  . 
  (a)        Each Credit Party waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable law and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor s power whatsoever.  Each Credit Party waives any defense (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) based on or arising out of any defense of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from  
  
   111 

any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party other than payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment.  The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Credit Party hereunder except to the extent the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been paid.  Each Credit Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted under law, any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Credit Party against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security. 
  (b)        Each Credit Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted under law, all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Credit Party Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Relevant Guaranteed Obligations.  Each Credit Party assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Relevant Guaranteed Party s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Credit Party assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the other Guaranteed Creditors shall have any duty to advise any Credit Party of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks. 
   
  14.09.        Maximum Liability  .  It is the desire and intent of each Credit Party and the Guaranteed Creditors that this Credit Party Guaranty shall be enforced against such Credit Party to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  If, however, and to the extent that, the obligations of any Credit Party under this Credit Party Guaranty shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable federal, state, provincial or foreign law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers), then the amount of such Credit Party s obligations under this Credit Party Guaranty shall be deemed to be reduced and such Credit Party shall pay the maximum amount of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations which would be permissible under applicable law. 
   
  14.10.        Payments  .  All payments made by a Credit Party pursuant to this   Section 14   will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of   Section 2.06  . 
   
  14.11.        Keepwell  .  Each Credit Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Credit Party Guaranty or the grant of the security interest under the Credit Documents, in each case, by any Specified Credit Party, becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Credit Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Credit Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under this Credit Party Guaranty and the other Credit Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor s obligations and undertakings under this   Section 14   voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this   Section 14.11   shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and  
  
   112 

performed in full.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends this   Section 14.11   to constitute, and this   Section 14.11   shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a  keepwell, support, or other agreement  for the benefit of, each Specified Credit Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
   
  14.12.        Information  .  Each Credit Party assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each applicable Borrower s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of non-payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Credit Party assumes and incurs under this guarantee, and agrees that no Guaranteed Creditor shall have any duty to advise any Credit Party of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks. 
   
  14.13.        Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this   Section 14.13  , if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by debtor relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
