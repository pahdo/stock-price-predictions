     Table of Contents          Baixo Relocation Services, Inc.    Notes to the consolidated financial statements  August 31, 2016  (Unaudited)         Note 1: Nature and Continuance of Operations      Baixo Relocation Services, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on January 7, 2014 ("Inception"). The Company operates as a relocation service provider for clients moving to the State of Goa, India. The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Baixo, India and its fiscal year-end is February 28.       Note 2: Basis of Presentation       Unaudited interim consolidated financial statements      The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Baixo Relocation Services, Inc and its wholly-owned Indian subsidiary, Baixo Relocation Services Private Limited. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. During the period ended August 31, 2016, the Company dissolved its wholly-owned subsidiary and therefore the balance sheet as at August 31, 2016 represents only the assets and liabilities of the Company.      The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-X. They may not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2016 included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three and six months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending February 28, 2017.      Note 3: Capital Stock      The total number of common shares authorized that may be issued by the Company is 75,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. At August 31, 2016, there were 8,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (at February 29, 2016: 8,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding).     At August 31, 2016, there were no issued and outstanding stock options or warrants.                   7       
     Table of Contents          Note 4: Going Concern      These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $70,063 as at August 31, 2016 ($54,663 as at February 29, 2016) and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition to operational expenses, as the Company executes its business plan, it is incurring expenses related to complying with its public reporting requirements. In order to remain in business, the Company will need to raise capital in the next twelve months. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations.     Note 5: Subsequent Events      The Company s management has evaluated subsequent event up to October 20, 2016, the date the financial statements were issued, pursuant to the requirements of ASC 855 and has determined the following material subsequent event:     Effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues, the majority shareholder, sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors of the Company entered into certain stock purchase agreements with certain investors. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. This has resulted in a change of control.      Note 6: Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements      The Company evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements would not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.                  8       
     Table of Contents           ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.       The following discussion of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, plan of operations and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, together with the notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.      OVERVIEW      Baixo Relocation Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on January 7, 2014 in the State of Nevada. We previously operated a consulting business whereby we provided personalized relocation services to clients, both individual and corporate, who were relocating to the state of Goa. We assisted clients who intended to relocate to the region for temporary, long-term, and permanent periods. We offered a wide range of relocation services to our clients, including arranging and assisting with transportation in the state of Goa, India, household goods movement, appropriate immigration documentation, real estate rental and purchases, children s  education registration, area orientation, housekeeping, utilities connections, banking introductions, local transportation, tax compliance, and language and cultural training.     As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are deemed to be a shell corporation as defined in Rule 230.405 of the Securities Act and, therefore, issued shares of restricted stock available for sale under Rule 144 may be affected. We must cure ourselves of our shell status by: (i) no longer fitting the definition of a shell company as defined in Rule 144(i)(1); (ii) subjecting to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") and filing all reports (other than Form 8-K reports) required under the Exchange Act for the preceding twelve months; and (iii) filing current  Form 10 information  with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer an issuer described in Rule 144(i)(1) and one year has elapsed since the filing of the "Form 10 information" with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       Change in Control      Effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues ( Rodrigues ), the majority shareholder, sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors of Baixo Relocation Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the  Company ) entered into certain stock purchase agreements (collectively, the  Stock Purchase Agreements ) with certain individuals and/or entities (collectively, the  Investors ). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussions are based on our consolidated financial statements, including our subsidiaries. These charts and discussions summarize our financial statements for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto, included with our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.        Balance sheet   as at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016       At August 31, 2016, our current assets were $32 and our current liabilities were $300. Current assets comprised $32 in cash and current liabilities comprised of $300 in accrued liabilities.     As of August 31, 2016, our total assets were $32 comprised of $32 in current assets. The decrease in total assets during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 from fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in cash of $15,132.                   9       
     Table of Contents         As of August 31, 2016, our total liabilities were $300 comprised of $300 in current liabilities. The slight decrease in liabilities during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 from fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in accrued liabilities of $41.      Stockholders  equity decreased from $15,132 for fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 to $(268) for the six month period ended August 31, 2016.        Statement of Operations                For the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.        Our net loss for the six month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($15,400) compared to a net loss of ($22,091) during the six month period ended August 31, 2015 (a decrease in net loss of $6,691). We did not generate any revenue during the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.      During the six month period ended August 31, 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $15,400 compared to $22,091 incurred during the six month period ended August 31, 2015 (a decrease of $6,691). These operating expenses incurred during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 consisted of: (i) general and administrative of $5,688 (2015: $3,313); and (ii) professional fees of $9,712 (2015: $18,778). Operating expenses incurred during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 decreased compared to the six month period ended August 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $9,066, partially offset by an increase in General expenses amounting to $2,375.      Our loss from operations during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($15,400) compared to a loss from operations of ($22,091) during the six month period ended August 31, 2015.      During the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively, we did not incur any other expense.      Therefore, we realized a net loss of ($15,400) or ($0.002) per share for the six month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of ($22,091) or ($0.003) per share for the six month period ended August 31, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 8,000,000 for the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.        For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.        Our net loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($7,416) compared to a net loss of ($14,593) during the three month period ended August 31, 2015 (a decrease in net loss of $7,902). We did not generate any revenue during the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.             During the three month period ended August 31, 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $7,416 compared to $14,593 incurred during the three month period ended August 31, 2015 (a decrease of $7,902). These operating expenses incurred during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 consisted of: (i) general and administrative of $1,204 (2015: $1,175); and (ii) professional fees of $6,212 (2015: $13,418). Operating expenses incurred during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 decreased compared to the three month period ended August 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $7,206.      Our loss from operations during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($7,416) compared to a loss from operations of ($14,593) during the three month period ended August 31, 2015.      During the three month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively, we did not incur any other expense.      Therefore, we realized a net loss of ($7,416) or ($0.001) per share for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of ($14,593) or ($0.002) per share for the three month period ended August 31, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 8,000,000 for the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCE      At August 31, 2016, our current assets were $32 and our current liabilities were $300, which resulted in a working capital deficit of $268. As at August 31, 2016, current assets comprised $32 in cash and current liabilities comprised of $300 in accrued liabilities.      We are actively seeking various financing operations to meet the working capital requirements.        Cash Flows from Operating Activities       We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six month period ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was ($15,441) compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of ($23,416) for the six month period ended August 31, 2015. Net cash flows used in operating activities consisted primarily of a net loss of $15,400 (2015: $22,091), which was partially adjusted by ($41) (2015: ($1,325)) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.        Cash Flows from Investing Activities       For the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities was $-0- .        Cash Flows from Financing Activities       For the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, net cash flows provided from financing activities was $-0-.      Our cash balance at August 31, 2016 was $32. If additional funds become required before generation of revenue, the additional funding may come from debt financing or equity financing from the sale of our common stock.      Our future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:                   our ability to raise additional funding;                        interest by online users to retain us for our services which will generate revenue.               Due to our lack of operating history and present inability to generate revenues, our auditors have stated their opinion that there currently exists a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.      The detailed analysis of the risk factors is disclosed our Company s registration statement Form S-1 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       Future Financings        As at August 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $268 and we will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations.      When we will require additional financing, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. We are pursuing various alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements.      We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.      Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we generate sufficient revenues. There is no assurance we will ever reach that point. In the meantime the continuation of the Company is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, our ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations.     Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.      We require approximately $15,000 for the next 12 months as a reporting issuer and additional funds are required. Before generation of revenue, the additional funding may come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or loans from management or related third parties. In the event we do not raise sufficient capital to implement its planned operations or divest, your entire investment could be lost.      Going Concern Consideration      The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the period ended February 29, 2016 included a going concerned paragraph because of a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based on the absence of an established source of revenue, recurring losses from operations, and our need for additional financing in order to fund our operations in fiscal 2017.      Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.         Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.                    ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUNTITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.         ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2015. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the second quarter of 2016. In connection with such evaluation, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of our second quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. While there have been no changes, we have assessed our internal controls as being deficient and will be taking steps during 2016/2017 to remedy such deficiencies.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION           ITEM 1.

OTHER INFORMATION        CHANGE IN CONTROL       Effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues ( Rodrigues ), the majority shareholder, our sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors, entered into those certain stock purchase agreements (collectively, the  Stock Purchase Agreements ) with certain individuals and/or entities (collectively, the  Investors ). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, there has been a change in control.              Beneficial Ownership Chart      The following table sets forth certain information, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, with respect to the beneficial ownership of the outstanding common stock by: (i) any holder of more than five (5%) percent; (ii) each of our executive officers and directors; and (iii) our directors and executive officers as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, each of the stockholders listed below has sole voting and investment power over the shares beneficially owned. Unless otherwise indicated, each of the stockholders named in the table below has sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares of common stock. Beneficial ownership consists of a direct interest in the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there are 8,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.        _____________         *  Less than one percent.               (1)    Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding as of the date of this Quarterly Report. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there are 8,000,000 shares issued and outstanding.               (2)    The person who has sole dispositive and voting power over the shares held by 1322975 Alberta Ltd. is M. Robert Mackinnon.                  CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT      Effective October 3, 2016, our certifying accountant, Seale and Beers, CPAs, LLC ( S B ), was dismissed as our independent registered public accounting firm based upon the recent announcement of its acquisition by a new auditing firm, AMC Auditing, LLC. We have engaged SRCO Professional Corporation, Chartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants ( SRCO ) as our principal independent registered public accounting firm effective October 3, 2016. The decision to change our principal independent registered public accounting firm has been approved by our Board of Directors.     The reports of S B on our financial statements for fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 (which included the balance sheet as of February 29, 2016, and the statement of operations, cash flows and stockholders  equity as of February 29, 2016), for either of the past two fiscal years, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, other than to state that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. During our fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 and during the subsequent period through to the date of S B's dismissal, there were no disagreements between us and S B, whether or not resolved, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of S B, would have caused S B to make reference thereto in its report on our audited financial statements.     We provided S B with a copy of the Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that S B furnish us with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not S B agrees with the statements made in the Current Report on Form 8-K with respect to S B and, if not, stating the aspects with which they do not agree. We received the requested letter from S B wherein it has confirmed their agreement to our disclosures in the Current Report with respect to S B. A copy of S B's letter was filed as an exhibit to the Current Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 6, 2016.      In connection with our appointment of SRCO as our principal registered accounting firm at this time, we have not consulted SRCO on any matter relating to the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or contemplated, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements during the two most recent fiscal years (February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015) and subsequent interim period through the date of engagement.     The contact information for SRCO is Park Place Corporate Centre, 15 Wertheim Court, Suite 409, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada L4B 3H7, telephone 905.882.9500.               ITEM 6.
