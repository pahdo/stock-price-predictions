           Note 1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
       
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the quarter and nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard.  Investments in affiliates, including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee s activities, are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  The Company s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.  In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Company s year end and are consistent from period to period. 
    
  Reclassification 
    
  The Company classified   $17 million   and   $53 million   of intangible amortization in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.   Prior period amounts of   $8 million   and   $22 million   in the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, have been reclassified from other (income) expense - net to conform to the current presentation.  
    
  Last-in, First-out (LIFO) Inventories 
    
  Interim period LIFO calculations are based on interim period costs and management s estimates of year-end inventory levels.  Because the availability and price of agricultural commodity-based LIFO inventories are unpredictable due to factors such as weather, government farm programs and policies, and changes in global demand, quantities of LIFO-based inventories at interim periods may vary significantly from management s estimates of year-end inventory levels. 

Note 2. 
    New Accounting Standards 
       
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the amended guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , which simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination.  The amended guidance requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, shall be recorded in the same period s financial statements.  The amended guidance also requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial results.

           Note 2. 
    New Accounting Standards (Continued) 

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, which amended the guidance of ASC Topic 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  , to simplify the accounting for share-based payment award transactions.  The areas of simplification include the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. 

Note 3. 
    Pending Accounting Standards 
       
  Effective January 1, 2017, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 330,   Inventory  , which simplifies the measurement of inventory.  The amended guidance requires an entity to measure its cost-based inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, where net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2017, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 323,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures  , which simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting.  The amended guidance eliminates the requirement of an investor to adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively when an investment qualifies for equity method accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence.  The amendments require that the investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investors  previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will be required to adopt the new guidance of ASC Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606), which will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  .  Topic 606 requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance requires the Company to apply the following steps:  (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.  The Company will be required to adopt Topic 606 either on a full retrospective basis to each prior reporting period presented or on a modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application.  The Company will adopt Topic 606 on a modified retrospective basis and will be required to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes.  The adoption of this new guidance will require expanded disclosures in the Company s consolidated financial statements.  The Company expects to complete its assessment of the financial impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements by the end of 2016. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 825-10,   Financial Instruments - Overall  , which is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.  The amended guidance requires an entity to measure equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by using a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company s financial results.

           Note 3. 
    Pending Accounting Standards (Continued) 

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC 230,   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230), which is intended to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments provide guidance on debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect to have significant changes on its consolidated statements of cash flows when it adopts the amended guidance on October 1, 2016. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2019, the Company will be required to adopt the new guidance of ASC Topic 842,   Leases   (Topic 842), which will supersede ASC Topic 840,   Leases  .  Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  The Company expects to adopt Topic 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  The Company has not yet completed the assessment of the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2020, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of Topic 326,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  , which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.  The amended guidance requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Early adoption will be permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company s financial results.   

Note 4. 
    Acquisitions 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired a   90%   interest in Harvest Innovations, an industry leader in minimally processed, expeller-pressed soy proteins, oils, and gluten-free ingredients; a   50%   interest in Cairo-based Medsofts Group, a joint venture that owns and manages merchandising and supply chain operations; Caterina Foods, a leading toll manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas; and a Casablanca, Morocco-based corn wet mill that produces glucose and native starch for an aggregate cost of   $136 million   in cash and recorded preliminary allocations of purchase prices related to the acquisitions.  The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions, net of cash acquired of   $11 million  , was preliminarily allocated to working capital, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets, other long-term assets, other long-term liabilities, and redeemable noncontrolling interest for   $15 million  ,   $23 million  ,   $70 million  ,   $41 million  ,   $42 million  ,   $17 million  , and   $38 million  , respectively.    
    
  The remaining   10%   interest in Harvest Innovations is recorded in other long-term liabilities and accounted for as a mandatorily redeemable interest which the Company has agreed to acquire following   two   years of operations. 
    
  In April 2016, the Company acquired a   50%   interest in Medsofts Group.  The Company has an option   three   years from the date of acquisition to acquire the remaining   50%   interest in Medsofts Group based on a fixed multiple of earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization for the last   twelve   months of this   three  -year period.  If the Company does not elect to exercise its option, the noncontrolling interest holder has the option to put the   50%   interest to the Company on similar, though discounted, terms.  The Company records the   50%   remaining interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest.

    Fair Value Measurements 
       
  The following tables set forth, by level, the Company s assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

    Fair Value Measurements (Continued) 

Estimated fair values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets, broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  Market valuations for the Company s inventories are adjusted for location and quality because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3.  Changes in the fair value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

           Note 5. 
    Fair Value Measurements (Continued) 

Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies.  Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1.  The majority of the Company s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables.  Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.  These differences are generally determined using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets.  When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3.  Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, or other (income) expense   net depending upon the purpose of the contract.  The effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur. 
    
  The Company s cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. 
    
  The Company s marketable securities are comprised of equity investments, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, and other debt securities.  Publicly traded equity investments and U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.  Corporate debt and other debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and substantially all are classified in Level 2.  Unrealized changes in the fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of AOCI unless a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary at which point the decline is recorded in earnings. 
    
  The Company s segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities.  U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1. 
    
  The Company has deferred consideration under its accounts receivable securitization programs (the  Programs ) which represents notes receivable from the purchasers under the Programs (see Note 16).  This amount is reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 8).  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received.  The fair value is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the Programs, which have historically been insignificant.

    Fair Value Measurements (Continued) 

For all periods presented, the Company had no transfers between Level 1 and 2.  Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold.  Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2. 
    
  In some cases, the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable.  These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms.  In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as Basis.  The changes in unobservable price components are determined by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.  Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these unobservable price components.  
    
  The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Company s Level 3 valuations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The Company s Level 3 measurements may include Basis only, transportation cost only, or both price components.  As an example, for Level 3 inventories with Basis, the unobservable component as of   September 30, 2016   is a weighted average   17.9%   of the total price for assets and   60.7%   of the total price for liabilities. 

In certain of the Company s principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts.  These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price.  In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources.  In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100% unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3.

  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
    
  The majority of the Company s derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.  The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets.  Derivatives, including exchange-traded contracts and physical purchase or sale contracts, are stated at market value and inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately.  Inventory is not a derivative and therefore fair values of and changes in fair values of inventories are not included in the tables below.  
     
  The following table sets forth the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The following tables set forth the pre-tax gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments that have been included in the consolidated statements of earnings for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedging Strategies 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has certain derivatives designated as cash flow and fair value hedges. 
    
  The Company uses interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to protect the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in interest rates.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying fixed-rate debt are recorded in other (income) expense - net.  The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt resulting in no ineffectiveness.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has   $28 million   in other current assets representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding increase in the underlying debt for the same amount with no impact to earnings. 
  For each of the commodity hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  Assuming normal market conditions, the changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains/losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has   $39 million   of after-tax   losses   in AOCI related to gains and losses from commodity cash flow hedge transactions.  The Company expects to recognize   $35 million   of these after-tax   losses   in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months. 
  The Company uses futures or options contracts to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company s forecasted purchases of corn.  The Company s corn processing plants currently grind approximately   76 million   bushels of corn per month.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between   16%   and   66%   of its monthly anticipated grind.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has designated hedges representing between   14%   and   62%   of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next   12 months  . 
    
  The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to fix the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts.  The Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various exchange-traded ethanol contracts.  The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company s sales of ethanol.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between   0   and   93 million   gallons of ethanol sales per month under these programs.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has designated hedges representing between   0   and   66 million   gallons of ethanol sales per month over the next   12 months  .

    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Continued) 

Hedge ineffectiveness for commodity contracts results when the change in the price of the underlying commodity in a specific cash market differs from the change in the price of the derivative financial instrument used to establish the hedging relationship.  As an example, if the change in the price of a corn futures contract is strongly correlated to the change in cash price paid for corn, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is deferred and recognized at the time the corn grind occurs.  If the change in price of the derivative does not strongly correlate to the change in the cash price of corn, in the same example, some portion or all of the derivative gains or losses may be required to be recognized in earnings prior to when the corn grind occurs. 
    
  Net Investment Hedging Strategies 
    
  On June 24, 2015, the Company issued     500 million   aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes and    600 million   aggregate principal amount of   1.75%   Notes (collectively, the  Notes ).  The Company has designated    1.1 billion   of the Notes as a hedge of its net investment in a foreign subsidiary.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has   $11 million   of losses in AOCI related to gains and losses from the net investment hedge transaction.  The amount is deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested.

    Marketable Securities (Continued) 

The   $23 million   in unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   arose within the last 12 months and is related to the Company s investment in   one     available-for-sale equity     security   with a fair value of   $296 million  .  The Company evaluated the near-term prospects of the issuer in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment.  Based on that evaluation and the Company s ability and intent to hold this investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For information on other-than temporary impairment charges, see Note 15.   

Note 8.              Other Current Assets 
    
  The following table sets forth the items in other current assets: 

(1)    The Company provides financing to certain suppliers, primarily Brazilian farmers, to finance a portion of the suppliers  production costs.  The amounts are reported net of allowances of   $8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Interest earned on financing receivables of   $5 million   and   $17 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings. 
    
   (2)    Non-trade receivables include   $250 million   and   $272 million   of reinsurance recoverables as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

    Debt and Financing Arrangements 
       
  On August 11, 2016, the Company issued   $1.0 billion   aggregate principal amount of   2.5%   Notes due in   2026  .  Proceeds before expenses were   $993 million  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company s long-term debt exceeded the carrying value by   $1.4 billion  , as estimated using quoted market prices (a Level 2 measurement under applicable accounting standards). 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs, totaling   $7.0 billion  , of which   $6.1 billion   was unused.  Of the Company s total lines of credit,   $4.0 billion   support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was   no   commercial paper outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the  Programs ).  The Programs provide the Company with up to   $1.5 billion   in funding resulting from the sale of accounts receivable.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company utilized   $0.7 billion   of its facility under the Programs (see Note 16 for more information on the Programs).   

The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   28.3%   and   27.7%  , respectively, compared to   31.1%   and   28.7%   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The decrease in effective tax rate in the current quarter is due to changes in the forecasted geographic mix of pretax earnings, including the tax impact of portfolio actions. 
    
  The Company is subject to routine examination by domestic and foreign tax authorities and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiation with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions. In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential additional tax owed by the Company in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.  However, the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations. 
    
  The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, ADM do Brasil Ltda. (ADM do Brasil), has received   three   separate tax assessments from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service     (BFRS)     challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related expenses for the tax years 2004, 2006, and 2007.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these assessments, updated for estimated penalties, interest, and variation in currency exchange rates, totaled approximately   $455 million  .  The statute of limitations for 2005 and 2008 to 2010 has expired.  The Company does not expect to receive any additional tax assessments.

  Note 11.              Income Taxes (Continued) 

ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains, which are included in ADM do Brasil s calculations of taxable income in Brazil, and losses, which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded, based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian income tax expense.  Therefore, the Company has continued to recognize the tax benefit from hedging losses in its financial statements and has not recorded any tax liability for the amounts assessed by the BFRS. 
    
  ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  The appeal panel found in favor of the BFRS on these assessments and ADM do Brasil filed a second level administrative appeal.  The second administrative appeal panel continues to conduct customary procedural activities, including ongoing dialogue with the BFRS auditor.  If ADM do Brasil continues to be unsuccessful in the administrative appellate process, the Company intends to file appeals in the Brazilian federal courts.  While the Company believes its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of, and expense for, income tax and the associated interest and penalties.   
    
  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2010. 
    
  The Company s subsidiaries in Argentina have received tax assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports totaling   $113 million   (inclusive of interest and adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates) for the tax years 2004 through 2008.  The Argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  While the Company believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws, it cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for years subsequent to 2008, and estimates that these potential assessments would be approximately   $159 million   (as of   September 30, 2016   and subject to variation in currency exchange rates).  The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments, and has concluded, based on Argentine tax law, that its tax position would be sustained, and accordingly, has not recorded a tax liability for these assessments.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2008.   
    
  In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions, the Company has not recorded an uncertain tax liability for these assessments because it has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the Brazil and Argentina matters based upon their technical merits and because the taxing jurisdictions  processes do not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the full amount of the assessment.  The Company s consideration of these tax assessments requires judgments about the application of income tax regulations to specific facts and circumstances.  The final outcome of these matters cannot reliably be predicted, may take many years to resolve, and could result in financial impacts of up to the entire amount of these assessments.   
    
  The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, ADM Europe B.V., has received a tax assessment totaling approximately   $100 million   from the Netherlands tax authority challenging the transfer pricing aspects of a 2009 business reorganization which involved two of its subsidiary companies in the Netherlands.  The Company has appealed the assessment and carefully evaluated the underlying transactions and has concluded the amount of the gain recognized on the reorganization for tax purposes was appropriate.  While the Company plans to vigorously defend its position against the assessment, the Company recognizes that settlement of disputed items may be prudent in some limited situations to eliminate the risk, costs, and uncertainty of the litigation.  Accordingly, the Company has accrued an amount it believes is appropriate to resolve the matter.  If the Company is unable to reach an acceptable settlement with the Netherlands tax authorities, the Company s defense of its position, including appeal to the judicial level, may take an extended period of time, and could result in additional financial impacts of up to the entire amount of this assessment.

Note 16.           Sale of Accounts Receivable 
    
  Since March 2012, the Company has had an accounts receivable securitization program (the  Program ) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the  Purchasers ).  Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Receivables, LLC ( ADM Receivables ).  ADM Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.  In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables receives a cash payment of up to   $1.2 billion   and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Program terminates on June 23, 2017, unless extended.

  Note 16.           Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued) 

In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program (the  Second Program ) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the  Second Purchasers ).  Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company ( ADM Ireland Receivables ).  ADM Ireland Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.    In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to   $0.3 billion   and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Second Program terminates on March 17, 2017, unless extended.   
    
  Under the Program and Second Program (collectively, the  Programs ), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers and other consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables. 
    
  The Company accounts for these transfers as sales.  The Company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Company s consolidated balance sheet was   $1.4 billion   and   $1.7 billion  , respectively.  In exchange for the transfer as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company received cash of   $0.7 billion   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively, and recorded a receivable for deferred consideration included in other current assets of   $0.7 billion   and   $0.5 billion  , respectively.  Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were   $24.4 billion   and   $30.3 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Of this amount,   $23.9 billion   and   $29.9 billion   pertain to cash collections on the deferred consideration for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Deferred consideration is paid to the Company in cash on behalf of the Purchasers and Second Purchasers as receivables are collected; however, as these are revolving facilities, cash collected from the Company s customers is reinvested by the Purchasers and Second Purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the Programs.  
    
  The Company s risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the Programs is limited to the deferred consideration outstanding.  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received and is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement under the applicable accounting standards) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the Programs which have historically been insignificant. 
    
  Transfers of receivables under the Programs resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of   $2 million   and   $1 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4 million   and   $3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. 
     
  The Company reflects all cash flows related to the Programs as operating activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   because the cash received from the Purchasers and Second Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significantly different risks given the short-term nature of the Company s trade receivables.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Company Overview 
    
  This MD A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
    
  The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in   165   countries.  The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for its shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities. 
    
  The Company s operations are organized, managed and classified into four reportable business segments: Agricultural Services, Corn Processing, Oilseeds Processing, and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other. See Note 14 of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  included in Item 1 herein,  Financial Statements  for more information about the Company s business segments. 
    
  The Company s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include: 

the purchase in February 2016 of a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, an industry leader in minimally processed, expeller-pressed soy proteins, oils, and gluten-free ingredients; 
                
    the purchase in April 2016 of a 50% interest in Cairo-based Medsofts Group, a consolidated joint venture that will own and manage merchandising and supply chain operations; 
                
    the sale in May 2016 of the sugarcane ethanol operations in Limeira do Oeste in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais; 
                
    the purchase in May 2016 of the remaining 60% interest in Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds; 
                
    the acquisition in June 2016 of a Casablanca, Morocco-based corn wet mill that produces glucose and native starch from Tate   Lyle; 
                
    the receipt of  all regulatory approvals in September 2016 of Olenex, a joint venture with Wilmar for the sale and marketing of refined vegetable oils and fats in Europe; and 
                
    the purchase in September 2016 of Caterina Foods, a leading toll manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas.  
       
  As part of the evolution of the Company s strategic plan, the Company is currently undertaking a fresh look at the capital intensity of its operations and portfolio, seeking ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to drive long-term returns. 
    
  Operating Performance Indicators  
    
  The Company is exposed to certain risks inherent to an agricultural-based commodity business.  These risks are further described in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company s agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit. 
    
  The Company s corn processing operations and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit. 

33 

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in   82   countries.  For the majority of the Company s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  For the majority of the Company s business activities in Brazil, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency.  Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar. 
    
  The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, EBITDA, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.  The Company s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information. 

Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 
    
  As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results.  Agricultural Services was positively impacted by the return of U.S. grain export competitiveness in global markets, which translated to a significant increase in volumes.  In Corn Processing, U.S. demand for sweeteners and starches and exports, principally to Mexico, remained solid.  Corn-based ethanol remained a very competitive transportation fuel.  Domestic demand for ethanol has been strong as U.S. gasoline demand was up compared with 2015.  U.S. ethanol continued to be the cheapest octane in the world, driving strong export volumes through the first half of 2016.  Production levels remained high, improving spot replacement margins this quarter, but slowed from the rate in the first quarter due to seasonal maintenance.  In Oilseeds Processing, global demand was solid and crushing operations achieved high capacity utilization throughout the quarter.  Origination volumes in Brazil were lower than expected due to adverse weather conditions.  Softseed prices remained high relative to products, resulting in weak margins causing a shift to crush more soybeans.  Vegetable oils continued to maintain a steady demand from the food industry.  Oil demand for fuels was strong and sales of biodiesel benefited from the biodiesel blending credit that has been established for calendar 2016 in North America.  The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business continued to focus on cost synergies and new revenue opportunities.  Customers  interest in innovative, healthy, and nutritious food products in response to macro trends in diet and demographics remained strong and continued to grow. 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Net earnings attributable to controlling interests was   $341 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $252 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Segment operating profit decreased   $64 million   to   $645 million  , due primarily to lower global soy crush margins, and a loss from the Company s equity investment in Wilmar, partially offset by improved North American export margins and volumes and improved sweetener results.  Included in this quarter s segment operating profit was   $3 million   of mark-to-market gains related to hedge timing effects compared to   $30 million   in the prior year s quarter.  Corporate results were a charge of   $165 million   this quarter compared to   $342 million   in last year s quarter.  Corporate results this quarter include a credit of   $85 million   from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to   $75 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
    
  Income taxes increased   $22 million   due to higher earnings before income taxes partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.  The Company s effective tax rate for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   28.3%   compared to   31.1%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   due to changes in the forecasted geographic mix of pretax earnings, including the tax impact of portfolio actions.

Analysis of Statements of Earnings 
    
  Processed volumes by product for the quarter are as follows (in metric tons): 

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.  
    
  Following the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015, the remaining results of Cocoa and Other were combined with the results of Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other within the Oilseeds Processing segment effective January 1, 2016.  Prior period results were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
    
  Revenues by segment for the quarter are as follows: 

35 

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds Processing and Agricultural Services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.    
    
  Revenues decreased   $0.7 billion  , or   4%  , to   $15.8 billion   due to lower sales prices (  $1.9 billion  ), including   $69 million   in foreign currency translation impacts, partially offset by higher overall sales volumes (  $1.2 billion  ).  The decrease in sales prices was due principally to a decrease in underlying commodity prices.  The increase in sales volumes was due principally to higher global demand for unprocessed commodities, partially offset by the impact of the sale of the cocoa business.  Agricultural Services revenues increased   5%   to   $7.0 billion   due to higher sales volumes ($1.4 billion) partially offset by lower average sales prices ($1.0 billion).  Corn Processing revenues decreased   5%   to   $2.4 billion   due to lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion).  Oilseeds Processing revenues decreased   14%   to   $5.8 billion   due to lower average sales prices ($0.8 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.2 billion). 
     
  Cost of products sold decreased   $0.7 billion   to   $14.7 billion   due principally to lower average commodity prices, including   $61 million   from foreign currency translation impacts, and lower manufacturing costs.  Included in cost of products sold is a credit of   $85 million   from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices during this quarter on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to   $75 million   in the prior year s quarter. Manufacturing expenses decreased $65 million to   $1.3 billion   primarily due to the sale of the cocoa business and lower energy usage and prices.   
    
  Gross profit was comparable at   $1.1 billion  .  Offsetting changes in gross profit consist principally of improved merchandising results (  $25 million  ) primarily due to increased volumes and improved margins as crop shortages in South America accelerated this year s seasonal shift in global demand to North America, margin contribution from Eaststarch C.V. which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in November 2015 (  $27 million  ), improved margins on liquid sweeteners due to higher demand (  $35 million  ), offset by lower soy crush margins (  $85 million  ).  These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on pages 37 and 38.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices during the third quarter of 2016 on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a positive impact on gross profit of   $85 million   compared to   $75 million   during the same period in 2015.  The decrease in underlying commodity prices from the prior year quarter did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.   
    
  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased   $42 million   to   $561 million   primarily due to legal settlements, costs, and legal fees partially offset by decreased expenses related to the sale of the cocoa business. 
    
  Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring charges decreased   $54 million   to   $11 million  .  Prior period charges include fixed asset impairments of $33 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil in the Corn Processing segment, other fixed asset impairments of $4 million in the Oilseeds Processing segment, and restructuring charges of $28 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement.  Current period charges include other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company s investment in two available for sale equity securities of $6 million in Corporate and individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges of $5 million. 
    
  Interest expense increased   $9 million   to   $78 million   due principally to the $1.0 billion debt issued in August 2016. 
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased   $63 million   to a loss of   $2 million   due primarily to equity losses from the Company s investment in Wilmar in the current quarter of approximately   $48 million   compared to equity earnings of $36 million in the year-ago quarter, and a decrease in equity earnings from Eaststarch C.V. which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in November 2015, partially offset by increased earnings from other equity investees. 
    
  Other income - net increased   $147 million   from a net expense of $143 million to income of   $4 million   due to the absence a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and a $32 million gain on sale of the global chocolate business, net of transaction expenses, in the year-ago quarter partially offset by a $5 million loss on the sale of an investment in the current quarter. 
  
   36 

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the quarter are as follows: 

Agricultural Services operating profit increased   $44 million   to   $193 million  .  Merchandising and Handling operating results improved   $33 million   to   $90 million   primarily due to increased volumes and improved margins as crop shortages in South America accelerated this year s seasonal shift in global demand to North America.  The global trade desk results were lower in the quarter as some commodity prices declined, causing global buyers to draw drown their inventories, which limited merchandising opportunities.  Milling and other operating results continued to perform well with another solid quarter, consistent with the year-ago period, on strong product margins related to seasonal demand.  Transportation results improved   $12 million   due to strong exports and improved freight rates. 
    
  Corn Processing operating profit increased   $81 million   to   $212 million  .  Included in the current quarter operating profit is   $3 million   of mark-to-market gains related to corn hedge timing effects compared to mark-to-market losses of   $1 million   in the prior year quarter.  Excluding corn hedge timing effects, Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $51 million as the business continued to perform well with solid demand, production efficiencies, and improved raw material costs.  The Company s Eaststarch C.V. operations and the Almidones Mexicanos joint venture also performed very well in the quarter.  Excluding corn hedge timing effects, Bioproducts profit in the quarter increased by $26 million due to absence of fixed asset impairment charges of $33 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil in the year-ago quarter and improved operational performance and margins from the animal nutrition business, partially offset by weaker risk management results in ethanol.  
  
   37 

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased   $191 million   to   $144 million  .  Included in the prior quarter operating profit is $31 million of mark-to-market gains related to cocoa hedge timing effects. Crushing and Origination operating profit declined   $97 million   to   $75 million   versus a very strong year-ago quarter due to lower soy crush margins.  In addition, origination volumes were lower due to the reduced Brazilian soybean and corn crop.  Excluding hedge timing effects, Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other operating profit increased $19 million to   $119 million   due to solid results in biodiesel, specialty fats and oils, and the Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts businesses.  Asia results declined   $82 million   to a loss of   $50 million  , due primarily to equity losses from the Company s investment in Wilmar in the current quarter of   $48 million   compared to equity earnings of   $36 million   in the year-ago quarter. 
    
  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) operating profit increased   $3 million   to   $73 million   with strong growth in flavors and systems offset by mixed results by some of the specialty ingredients businesses.  Current quarter results included approximately   $3 million   of operational start-up costs primarily related to the Tianjin fibersol facility in China and the Campo Grande specialty protein complex in Brazil. 
    
  Other - Financial operating profit was in line with the year-ago quarter. 
    
  Corporate results for the quarter are as follows: 

Corporate results were a net charge of   $165 million   this quarter compared to   $342 million   in last year s quarter.  The effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of   $85 million   this quarter compared to   $75 million   in the prior year quarter.  Interest expense - net increased   $6 million   due principally to the $1.0 billion debt issued in August 2016.  Unallocated corporate costs declined   $7 million   due primarily to the timing of spending on the Company s ERP program, lower spending on various strategic business improvement projects, and lower overall corporate staff costs.  Other charges in the current period included legal settlements, costs, and legal fees, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company investment in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the sale of an investment, and restructuring charges while other charges in the prior period consisted of the $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and restructuring charges of $28 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement.

    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.   
    
  Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.   
    
  Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA by segment are useful measures of the Company s profitability because they provide investors additional information about the Company s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability.  Adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. 
    
  The reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are provided in the following table.

Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 
    
  As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results.  Agricultural Services was negatively impacted by weak U.S. grain export competitiveness and decreased global merchandising opportunities in the first half of the year.  U.S. grain export competitiveness returned in the third quarter, which translated to significant volume increases.  In Corn Processing, U.S. demand for sweeteners and starches and exports, principally to Mexico, remained solid.  Corn-based ethanol remained a very competitive transportation fuel.  Domestic demand for ethanol has been strong as U.S. gasoline demand is up compared with 2015.  U.S. ethanol continued to be the cheapest octane in the world, driving strong export volumes through the first nine months of 2016.  Industry production levels remained high during the period.  In Oilseeds Processing, global crushing operations achieved high capacity utilization, although due to weaker meal demand, volumes were not as strong as in the prior year when crushing margins were very strong.  Softseed prices remained high relative to products, resulting in weak margins causing a shift to crush more soybeans.  Vegetable oils continued to maintain a steady demand from the food industry.  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business continued to focus on cost synergies and new revenue opportunities.  Customers  interest in innovative, healthy, and nutritious food products in response to macro trends in diet and demographics remained strong and continued to grow. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased   $276 million   to   $855 million  .   Segment operating profit decreased   $0.5 billion   to   $1.9 billion  , due to lower U.S. export volumes, weaker origination margins, reduced U.S. ethanol results, and weaker global crush margins.  Corporate results were a charge of   $705 million   for the nine months compared to   $789 million   the same period last year.  Corporate results for the nine months include a charge of   $17 million   from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a credit of   $16 million   the same period last year and a $50 million loss from the Company s share in the results of Compagnie Industrielle et Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (Luxembourg) s (CIP) updated portfolio valuations in the first quarter of 2016.   
    
  Income taxes decreased   $123 million   due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate.  The Company s effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased to   27.7%   compared to   28.7%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due primarily to changes in the forecasted geographic mix of pretax earnings. 

Analysis of Statements of Earnings 
    
  Processed volumes by product for the   nine   months are as follows (in metric tons): 

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.  The overall decrease in corn relates to the disposal of the sugar ethanol operations partially offset by volumes from the recently consolidated Eaststarch C.V.  
    
  Following the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015, the remaining results of Cocoa and Other were combined with the results of Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other within the Oilseeds Processing segment effective January 1, 2016.  Prior period results were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Revenues by segment for the   nine   months are as follows: 

Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds Processing and Agricultural Services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.   
    
  Revenues decreased   $5.4 billion  , or   11%  , to   $45.8 billion   due to lower average sales prices (  $4.3 billion  ), including   $0.4 billion   in foreign currency translation impacts, and lower overall sales volumes (  $1.1 billion  ).  The decrease in sales prices was due principally to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices, in particular prices of corn, soybeans, and soybean-related products.  The decrease in sales volumes was due principally to the sale of the cocoa business and decreased sales volumes of ethanol and grains.  Agricultural Services revenues decreased   8%   to   $19.8 billion   due to lower average sales prices (  $2.0 billion  ) partially offset by higher sales volumes (  $0.2 billion  ).  Corn Processing revenues decreased   8%   to   $7.0 billion   due to lower average sales prices (  $0.5 billion  ) and lower sales volumes (  $0.1 billion  ) due principally to ethanol.  Oilseeds Processing revenues decreased   15%   to   $16.9 billion   due to lower average sales prices (  $1.8 billion  ) and lower sales volumes (  $1.2 billion  ).

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Cost of products sold decreased   $4.9 billion   to   $43.2 billion   due principally to lower average commodity costs, including   $0.3 billion   in foreign currency translation impacts, and lower manufacturing costs.   Included in cost of products sold is a charge of   $17 million   from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of   $16 million   in the prior year s period.  Manufacturing expenses decreased   $0.2 billion   to $3.9 billion primarily due to the sale of the cocoa business, lower energy usage and prices, and decreased repairs and maintenance expenses.  
    
  Gross profit decreased   $0.5 billion  , or   16%  , to   $2.7 billion  .  The decrease in gross profit consists principally of reduced merchandising results (  $114 million  ) primarily due to compressed U.S. grain handling margins and lower volumes and freight rates in barge operations (  $25 million  ), lower ethanol volumes and margins (  $50 million  ), lower canola and soy crush margins (  $298 million  ),  and the sale of the cocoa business in the prior period (  $83 million  ).  These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on pages 45 and 46.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices during the nine months of 2016 on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a   $17 million   negative impact on gross profit compared to a positive impact of   $16 million   during the same period in 2015.  The decrease in underlying commodity prices from the prior year  did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.  
    
  Selling, general, and administrative expenses of   $1.6 billion   were comparable to the prior period.  Decreased expenses related to the sale of the cocoa business were offset by legal settlements, costs, and legal fees, increased transaction fees due to increased trading volume from the brokerage business, and expenses for the recently consolidated Eaststarch C.V.  
    
  Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased   $60 million   to   $36 million  .  Prior period charges include fixed asset impairments of $23 million related primarily to certain international Oilseeds Processing facilities, $34 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil in the Corn Processing segment, $2 million of other fixed asset impairments in the Agricultural Services segment, restructuring charges of $28 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, and goodwill impairment of $9 million related to certain international Oilseeds Processing facilities.  Current period charges include $11 million of software impairment in Corporate, $6 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company s investment in two available for sale equity securities in Corporate, $5 million of fixed asset impairments in Corn, and $14 million of other individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges. 
    
  Interest expense declined   $22 million   to   $213 million   primarily due to lower interest rates and the effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.  
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased   $134 million   to   $153 million   primarily due to lower earnings from the Company s investments in Wilmar and CIP and a decrease in equity earnings from Eaststarch C.V. which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in November 2015, partially offset by increased earnings from other equity investees. 
    
  Other income - net increased   $168 million   from a net expense of $30 million to income of   $138 million  .  Current period income includes $48 million of realized additional consideration related to the sale of the Company s equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, $59 million recovery of loss provisions and gain related to the sale of the Company s Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a $12 million gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest in Amazon Flavors, and a $10 million loss on sale of assets.  Prior period expense includes the $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt partially offset by a $27 million gain on the revaluation of the Company s previously held investments in North Star Shipping and Minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest, a gain of $68 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil to Glencore plc, a gain of $6 million on the sale of the lactic business, and a gain of $32 million on the sale of the global chocolate business, net of transaction expenses.

Operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the   nine   months are as follows: 

Agricultural Services operating profit decreased   $130 million   to   $365 million  .  Merchandising and Handling operating results  declined   $131 million   to   $98 million   primarily due to compressed grain handling margins in the first half of 2016.  International merchandising results were flat but remained weak overall. Strong origination results in Argentina and the addition of destination marketing in Egypt through the Company s Medsofts joint venture were partially offset by the absence of a $27 million gain on the revaluation of the Company s previously held investments in North Star Shipping and Minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest.  Milling and Other results increased   $29 million   to   $212 million  .  Current period results include realized additional consideration related to the sale of the Company s equity investment in Gruma S.A.B de C.V. in December 2012 of   $48 million  .  Transportation operating profit declined   $28 million   to   $55 million   due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates in the first half of 2016.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Corn Processing operating profit increased   $114 million   to   $562 million  .  Included in the current period operating profit is   $4 million   of mark to market gains related to corn hedge timing effects compared to   $4 million   of losses in the prior period.  Excluding corn hedge timing effects, Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $138 million as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing flex grind in the Company s corn wet mills.  The integration of the recent Eaststarch C.V. and Morocco acquisitions has gone better than planned, contributing to the Company s global sweeteners and starches portfolio and results.  Excluding corn hedge timing effects, Bioproducts profit in the period declined $32 million as weak ethanol margins continued due to high industry inventory levels.  
    
  Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased   $510 million   to   $638 million  .  Crushing and Origination operating profit declined   $439 million   to   $329 million   driven primarily by lower canola results in the first half of 2016 as well as lower global soy crush margins which were historically high last year and lower South American grain origination results caused by year-over-year slower farmer-selling partially offset by strong soybean and softseed volumes and margins in North America and South America.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results declined   $15 million   to   $250 million   due to the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015 which decreased results by $68 million, partially offset by good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and improved European biodiesel results.  Asia results declined   $56 million   to   $59 million  , due primarily to equity losses from the Company s investment in Wilmar in the current quarter of   $48 million  . 
    
  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) operating profit increased   $7 million   to   $249 million  .  Current period results included approximately   $10 million   of operational start-up costs primarily related to the Tianjin fibersol facility in China and the Campo Grande specialty protein complex in Brazil and a gain of $12 million related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Amazon Flavors.  Excluding these items, WFSI operating profit improved $5 million due to strong results in flavors and systems, specialty proteins, polyols, and natural health and nutrition products.  These increases were partially offset by weaker sales of ancient grains, edible beans, and hydrocolloids due to a combination of Company operational issues and weaker overall demand for these products. 
    
  Other - Financial operating profit increased on higher volumes from the Company s futures commission brokerage business and improved results from its captive insurance operations. 
    
  Corporate results for the   nine   months are as follows: 

Corporate results were a net charge of   $705 million   in the current period compared to a net charge of   $789 million   in the prior period.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a charge of   $17 million   in the current period compared to a credit of   $16 million   in the prior period.  Interest expense - net declined   $21 million   due principally to lower interest rates and the effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.  Unallocated corporate costs decreased   $19 million   primarily due to lower spending on various strategic business improvement projects and lower overall corporate staff costs.  Other charges in the current period included legal settlements costs, and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company s investment in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the sale of an investment, and other asset impairment and restructuring charges while other charges in the prior period consisted of the $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and restructuring charges of $28 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement.  Minority interest and other expense in the current period included a   $50 million   loss from the Company s share in the results of CIP s updated portfolio valuations in the first quarter of 2016.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.   
    
  Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.   
    
  Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA by segment are useful measures of the Company s profitability because they provide investors additional information about the Company s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability.  Adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.  
    
  The reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are provided in the following table. 

(1)     Tax effected using the Company s U.S. effective tax rate. 
   (2)     Tax effected using the applicable tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The Company s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the Company s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures.  The primary source of funds to finance the Company s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1.0 billion   of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of   1.6   to 1.  Included in working capital is   $4.5 billion   of readily marketable commodity inventories.  Cash provided by operating activities was   $1.2 billion   for the nine months compared to   $1.1 billion   the same period last year.  Working capital changes decreased cash by   $0.4 billion   for the nine months and for the same period last year.  Trade receivables increased   $0.5 billion   due principally to lower receivables sold under the accounts receivable securitization programs.  Inventories declined approximately   $1.1 billion   due to lower inventory quantities and lower prices.  Trade payables declined approximately   $0.6 billion   principally reflecting seasonal cash payments for North American harvest-related grain purchases.  Cash used in investing activities was   $1.2 billion   for the nine months compared to   $0.3 billion   the same period last year.  Sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, were   $35 million   for the nine months compared to $122 million the same period last year.  Capital expenditures for the nine months was   $0.6 billion   compared to   $0.8 billion   for the same period last year.  Other investing activities include additional investments in Wilmar of   $0.6 billion   for the nine months compared to $0.1 billion the same period last year.  Cash used in financing activities was   $0.1 billion   for the nine months compared to   $1.2 billion   the same period last year.  Long-term debt borrowings for the nine months of   $1.0 billion   related to the new debt issued on August 11, 2016 compared to $1.2 billion the same period last year which included the  1.1 billion notes issued on June 24, 2015.  Commercial paper borrowings for the nine months were $  0.1 billion   compared to $0.8 billion for the same period last year.  Treasury stock purchases were   $0.8 billion   for the nine months compared to $  1.8 billion   the same period last year. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s capital resources included net worth of   $17.6 billion   and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs, totaling   $7.0 billion  , of which   $6.1 billion   was unused.  The Company s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of the Company s long-term debt and shareholders  equity) was   27%   at   September 30, 2016   and   24%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  Of the Company s total lines of credit,   $4.0 billion   support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was   no   commercial paper outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had cash of   $0.7 billion  , of which   $0.4 billion   was cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.  The Company has asserted that these funds are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. due to the Company s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations, unused and available U.S. credit capacity of   $4.8 billion  , and domestic cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   of   $0.3 billion  .   
    
  The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the  Programs ) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.   The Programs provide the Company with up to   $1.5 billion   in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Company s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 16 of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  included in Item 1 herein,  Financial Statements  for more information and disclosures on the Programs).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company utilized   $0.7 billion   of its facility under the Programs. 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company spent approximately   $0.6 billion   in capital expenditures,   $0.1 billion   in acquisitions,   $0.6 billion   in additional Wilmar investments,   $0.5 billion   in dividends, and   $0.8 billion   in share repurchases.  The Company has a stock repurchase program and has acquired approximately   19.7 million   shares for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The Company has   37.0 million   shares remaining that may be purchased under the program until December 31, 2019.  
    
  The Company expects capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion during 2016.  In 2016, the Company expects aggregate cash outlays of approximately $0.7 billion in dividends and $1.0 billion in share repurchases, subject to strategic capital requirements.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
    
  The Company s purchase obligations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $12.7 billion   and   $9.7 billion  , respectively.  The increase is related to obligations to purchase higher quantities of agricultural commodity inventories and higher prices.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of   $11.9 billion   within the next twelve months.  There were no other material changes in the Company s contractual obligations during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s off balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  There were no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  The market risk inherent in the Company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.  Significant changes in market risk sensitive instruments and positions for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   are described below.  There were no material changes during the period in the Company s potential loss arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
    
  For detailed information regarding the Company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions, see Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Commodities 
    
  The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. 
    
  The fair value of the Company s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all significant commodity risk positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy.  The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one-year period.  Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly.   
    
  In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one-year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.  The highest, lowest, and average weekly position together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows:   

The change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of an decrease in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position.

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There was no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 
  The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes.  The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.  The Company has currently implemented changes to certain processes in over 200 locations and will continue to roll-out the ERP system over the next several years.  The Company has appropriately considered these changes in its design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and concluded, as part of the evaluation described in the above paragraph, that the implementation of the new ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected its internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 11 of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  included in Item 1 herein,  Financial Statements  for information on income tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. 
    
  Beginning in 2011, approximately 45 farmers in the U.S. brought suit in a Missouri state court against the Company and one of its employees to recover alleged losses from a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by a third-party grain handler, Cathy Gieseker, who was convicted in 2010 of felony fraud charges and is currently serving time in federal prison.  The farmers alleged that the Company knew or should have known of Ms. Gieseker s Ponzi scheme but did not stop it, that Ms. Gieseker was effectively acting as the Company s agent, and that the Company defrauded or otherwise wronged them.  Attorneys for these farmers claimed to represent more than 100 additional farmers with similar claims.  Collectively, all of the farmers sought more than   $250 million   in alleged economic losses, an unspecified amount for alleged mental pain and suffering, and an unspecified amount of punitive damages.  On August 24, 2016, the Company and the farmers entered into a comprehensive confidential settlement of the matter, in which the Company did not admit wrongdoing, and this matter is now at an end.  The Company recorded the settlement and related costs and fees pertaining to this matter in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
  The Company is a party to numerous lawsuits pending in various U.S. state and federal courts arising out of Syngenta Corporation s (Syngenta) marketing and distribution of genetically modified corn products, Agrisure Viptera and Agrisure Duracade, in the U.S.  First, the Company brought a state court action in Louisiana against Syngenta in 2014, alleging that Syngenta was negligent in commercializing its products before the products were approved in China.  Second, the Company is a putative class member in a number of purported class actions filed beginning in 2013 by farmers and other parties against Syngenta in federal courts and consolidated for pretrial proceedings in a multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas, again alleging that Syngenta was negligent in commercializing its products.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, Syngenta filed third-party claims against the Company and other grain companies seeking contribution in the event that Syngenta is held liable in these lawsuits; the courts dismissed these third-party claims on April 4, 2016, and the Company is therefore no longer a third-party defendant in the MDL.  Third, the Company and other grain companies have been named as a defendant in numerous individual and purported class action suits filed by farmers and other parties in state and federal court beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, alleging that the Company and other grain companies were negligent in failing to screen for genetically modified corn.  On September 6, 2016, the court in the Minnesota state MDL proceedings granted the Company s motion to dismiss the complaints against the Company in those actions.  The Company denies liability in all of the actions in which it has been named as a third-party defendant or defendant and is vigorously defending itself in these cases.  All of these actions are in pretrial proceedings.  At this time, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter with any reasonable degree of certainty, but believe it will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  The Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding or environmental claim that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

For purposes of this Agreement, the  Option Term  shall commence on the Date of Grant and shall expire on the day prior to the tenth anniversary thereof (the  Scheduled Termination Date ), unless earlier terminated as provided in Section 4 or Section 10 below.  Upon the expiration of the Option Term, any unexercised Option Shares shall be cancelled and shall be of no further force or effect. 
    
  Section 4  .    Effect of Termination of Service  .  Except as set forth below in this Section 4 or in Section 8 below, if you cease to be an Employee other than as a result of your death, Retirement or Disability prior to the occurrence of any otherwise applicable vesting date or event provided in Section 2 above, you shall (i) forfeit the Option Shares that have not yet become vested, which shall be cancelled and be of no further force or effect, and (ii) subject to Section 10 below, retain the right to exercise any Option Shares that have previously become vested until the earlier of (A) the date three months after the effective date of such termination of service, or (B) the Scheduled Termination Date.  If you cease to be an Employee as a result of Retirement or Disability, then subject to Section 8 and Section 10 below, you shall (i) continue to vest in the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 above, and (ii) retain the right to exercise all vested Option Shares until the Scheduled Termination Date.  If you cease to be an Employee as a result of death, then all Option Shares shall become fully and immediately vested and exercisable upon your death, and shall remain exercisable until the Scheduled Termination Date. 
    
  Section 5  .    Procedure for Exercise  .  The Option may be exercised, in whole or part (for the purchase of whole Shares only), by delivery by you to the Company (in accordance with such procedures as the

Committee may prescribe) of a written notice of exercise in the form specified by the Company (the  Exercise Notice ), along with payment in full of the Option Price in accordance with Section 6 below and payment of applicable withholding tax obligations in accordance with Section 7 below.

You hereby authorize the Company (or the Affiliate that employs you) to withhold from salary or other amounts owed to you any sums required to satisfy withholding tax obligations in connection with the Option.  If you wish to satisfy such withholding tax obligations by delivering Shares you already own or by having the Company retain a portion of the Option Shares that would otherwise be delivered to you upon exercise, you must make such a request which shall be subject to approval by the Company.

  (c)      Fundamental Change  .

  (e)      Good Reason  .  For purposes of this Section 8,  Good Reason  shall have the meaning specified in your employment agreement with the Company or an Affiliate, or, if you are not employed pursuant to an employment agreement or are party to an employment agreement that does not define the term,  Good Reason  shall mean any of the following events that occurs without your prior written consent:

The notice must set forth in reasonable detail the specific reason for the resignation and the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for concluding that such resignation is for Good Reason.  Failure to provide such notice within such 30-day period shall be conclusive proof that you do not  
  
   3 

have Good Reason to terminate employment.  In addition, Good Reason shall exist only if the Company or applicable Affiliate fails to remedy the event or events constituting Good Reason within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of resignation from you.

No Option Shares shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Option unless and until the Company and/or you shall have complied with all applicable federal, state or foreign registration, listing and/or qualification requirements and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, unless the Committee has received evidence satisfactory to it that you may acquire such Shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the applicable securities laws.  Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final, binding, and conclusive.  The Company reserves the right to legend any Share certificate or book-entry, conditioning sales of such shares upon compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations.

  (b)      Competition After Retirement or Disability  .  The Option Shares that would otherwise continue to vest after you cease to be an Employee due to Retirement or Disability as provided in Section 4 above shall continue to vest only if, prior to the final vesting date specified in the vesting and exercise

To the extent that this Award and any compensation associated therewith is considered  incentive-based compensation  within the meaning and subject to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, this Award and any compensation associated therewith shall be subject to potential forfeiture or recovery by the Company in accordance with any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee in response to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Company s Shares are then listed.  This Agreement may be unilaterally amended by the Committee to comply with any such compensation recovery policy.  
    
  Section 11  .    No Rights as Stockholder or Employee  . 
    
  (a)      No Stockholder Rights Before Exercise  .  You shall not have any privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Option Shares subject to (but not yet acquired upon valid exercise of) the Option, nor shall the Company have any obligation to pay any dividends or otherwise afford any rights to which holders of Shares are entitled with respect to any such Option Shares, until the date a stock certificate evidencing such Shares has been issued or an appropriate book-entry in the Company s stock register has been made. 
    
  (b)      No Rights as Employee  .  Nothing in this Agreement or the Option shall confer upon you any right to continue as an Employee of the Company or any Affiliate or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate your employment at any time.

In the event of certain corporate events specified in Article 20 of the Plan, this Option may be replaced by a substituted option award or canceled in exchange for payment of cash in accordance with the procedures and provisions of Article 20 of the Plan. 
    
  Section 13  .    Restriction on Transfer of Option  .  The Option may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way by you, except as provided in Section 6.10(b) of the Plan.  This Option may be exercisable during your lifetime only by you, by your legal guardian, committee or legal representative if you become legally incapacitated, or by a permitted transferee.  The Option shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Option contrary to the provisions of this Section 13 and Section 6.10(b) of the Plan, or the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process upon the Option, shall be null and void and without effect.

Any notice hereunder by you shall be given to the Company in writing and such notice shall be deemed duly given only upon receipt thereof at the following address: Corporate Secretary, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526, or at such other address as the Company may designate by notice to you.

You hereby authorize the Company (or the Affiliate that employs you) to withhold from salary or other amounts owed to you any sums required to satisfy withholding tax obligations in connection with the Option.  If you wish to satisfy such withholding tax obligations by delivering Shares you already own or by having the Company retain a portion of the Option Shares that would otherwise be delivered to you upon exercise, you must make such a request which shall be subject to approval by the Company.

  (b)      Option Not Continued, Assumed or Replaced  .  If this Stock Option Award is not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Change of Control that constitutes a Business Combination as  
  
   2 

contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 8(a) above, then, contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination, this Option shall become fully and immediately exercisable with respect to all of the previously unexercised Option Shares for such period of time prior to the effective time of the Business Combination as is deemed fair and equitable by the Committee, and shall terminate at the effective time of the Business Combination.  The Committee shall provide written notice of the period of accelerated exercisability this Option to you, and any exercise of this Option to the extent its exercisability has been accelerated as provided in this Section 8(b) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Business Combination and shall be effective only immediately before such consummation.   
    
  (c)      Fundamental Change  .  In connection with any Change of Control that constitutes a Fundamental Change as the term is defined in Article 20 of the Plan, the Committee retains the discretion to take any action with respect to this Stock Option Award contemplated by Article 20 of the Plan, including in connection with a Change of Control described in paragraph (b) of Section 2.7 of the Plan or a Change of Control that constitutes a Business Combination.

  (e)      Good Reason  .  For purposes of this Section 8,  Good Reason  shall have the meaning specified in your employment agreement with the Company or an Affiliate, or, if you are not employed pursuant to an employment agreement or are party to an employment agreement that does not define the term,  Good Reason  shall mean any of the following events that occurs without your prior written consent: 
    
  (i)    you experience a material diminution in your employment duties, authority or responsibilities as compared to your duties, authority and responsibilities as in effect during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control;

  (iv)    any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or an Affiliate of any agreement under which you provide services to the Company or such Affiliate. 
    
  Before a resignation by you will constitute a resignation for Good Reason, you must give the Company or applicable Affiliate a notice of resignation within 30 calendar days of the occurrence of the event alleged to constitute Good Reason.  The notice must set forth in reasonable detail the specific reason for the resignation and the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for concluding that such resignation is for Good Reason.  Failure to provide such notice within such 30-day period shall be conclusive proof that you do not  
  
   3 

have Good Reason to terminate employment.  In addition, Good Reason shall exist only if the Company or applicable Affiliate fails to remedy the event or events constituting Good Reason within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of resignation from you.

  (c)      Competition After Retirement or Disability  .  The Option Shares that would otherwise continue to vest after you cease to be an Employee due to Retirement or Disability as provided in Section 4 above shall continue to vest only if, prior to the final vesting date specified in the vesting and exercise schedule referenced in Section 2 above, you do not engage in any activities that compete with the business operations of the Company and its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, working in any capacity for another company engaged in the processing of agricultural commodities, the manufacturing of biodiesel, ethanol, or food and feed ingredients, or the operation of grain elevators and crop origination and transportation

  (d)      Compensation Recovery Policy  .  To the extent that this Award and any compensation associated therewith is considered  incentive-based compensation  within the meaning and subject to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, this Award and any compensation associated therewith shall be subject to potential forfeiture or recovery by the Company in accordance with any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee in response to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Company s Shares are then listed.

The Agreement consists of a notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award that has been provided to you (the  Notice ), these Terms and Conditions and the applicable terms of the Plan which are incorporated into the Agreement by reference, including the definitions of capitalized terms contained in the Plan. 
    
  Section 1  .      Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Award  .  The grant of this Restricted Stock Unit Award to you is effective as of the Date of Grant specified in the Notice.  This Restricted Stock Unit Award provides you the number of Restricted Stock Units specified in the Notice, each such Restricted Stock Unit representing the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock. 
    
  Section 2  .      Rights of the Recipient  . 
    
  (a)      No Shareholder Rights  .  The Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Award do not entitle you to any rights of a shareholder of the Company s common stock.  Your rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units shall remain forfeitable at all times by you until satisfaction of the vesting conditions set forth in Section 3. 
    
  (b)      Restrictions on Transfer  .  You shall not be entitled to transfer, sell, pledge, alienate, hypothecate or assign the Restricted Stock Units or this Award, except that in the event of your death, your estate shall be entitled to the Shares represented by the Restricted Stock Units.  Any attempt to otherwise transfer the Restricted Stock Units or this Award shall be void.  All rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units and this Award shall be available only to you during your lifetime, and thereafter to your estate. 
    
  (c)       Dividend Equivalents  .  As of each date that the Company pays a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock generally, the Company shall pay you an amount equal to the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its common stock on that date multiplied by the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to you under this Award as of the related dividend payment record date.  No such dividend equivalent payment shall be made with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, as of such record date, have either been settled as provided in Section 4 or forfeited pursuant to Sections 5 or 7 below.  Any such payment shall be made as soon as practicable after the related dividend payment date, but no later than the later of (i) the end of the calendar year in which the dividend payment date occurs, or (ii) the 15th day of the third calendar month after the dividend payment date. 
    
  Section 3  .      Vesting  .

Such issuance shall be evidenced by a stock certificate or appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, shall be subject to the tax withholding provisions of Section 8 below, and shall be in complete satisfaction of such vested Restricted Stock Units.  If the Restricted Stock Units that vest include a fractional Restricted Stock Unit, the Company shall round the number of vested Restricted Stock Units to the nearest whole unit prior to issuance of Shares as provided herein.  If the ownership of or issuance of Shares to you as provided herein is not feasible due to applicable exchange controls, securities or tax laws or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, you or your legal representative shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (as of the Vesting Date) of the Shares otherwise issuable to you, net of any amount required to satisfy withholding tax obligations as provided in Section 8 below. 
    
  Section 5  .      Effect of Termination of Service  .  If you cease to be an Employee prior to the Vesting Date other than as a result of your death, Retirement or Disability, you shall forfeit the Restricted Stock Units.

For purposes of this Agreement,  Good Reason  shall have the meaning specified in your employment agreement with the Company or an Affiliate, or, if you are not employed pursuant to an employment agreement or are party to an employment agreement that does not define the term,  Good Reason  shall mean any of the following events that occurs without your prior written consent:

The notice must set forth in reasonable detail the specific reason for the resignation and the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for concluding that such resignation is for Good Reason.  Failure to provide such notice within such 30-day period shall be conclusive proof that you do not have Good Reason to terminate employment.  In addition, Good Reason shall exist only if the Company or applicable Affiliate fails to remedy the event or events constituting Good Reason within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of resignation from you.   
    
  (e)      Cause  .

  (a)      Forfeiture Conditions  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i) you engage in intentional misconduct pertaining to any financial reporting requirement under the Federal securities laws resulting in the Company s being required to prepare and file an accounting restatement  
  
   3 

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) as a result of such misconduct, other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy, (ii) there is a material negative revision of a financial or operating measure on the basis of which incentive compensation was awarded or paid to you, (iii) you engage in any fraud, theft, misappropriation, embezzlement, or dishonesty to the material detriment of the Company s financial results as filed with the SEC, or (iv) during the term of your employment with the Company and its Affiliates, or during the period following Retirement or Disability and prior to the Vesting Date, you breach any non-compete or confidentiality restrictions applicable to you (including the non-compete restriction in paragraph 7(b) below), then (x) you shall immediately forfeit this Award and any right to receive Shares that have not yet been issued pursuant to Section 4 above, and (y) with respect to Shares that have been issued pursuant to this Award (or the cash value thereof paid) after the Vesting Date, (A) you shall return such Shares or cash value to the Company, or (B) if you have sold or otherwise transferred such Shares during the three-year period preceding the event specified in clauses (i)-(iv) above, you shall pay to the Company in cash an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares as of the Vesting Date (or equal to the cash value previously paid). 
     
  (b)      Competition After Retirement or Disability  .  The Restricted Stock Units that would otherwise continue to vest after you cease to be an Employee due to Retirement or Disability as provided in Section 5 above shall continue to vest only if, prior to the Vesting Date, you do not engage in any activities that compete with the business operations of the Company and its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, working in any capacity for another company engaged in the processing of agricultural commodities, the manufacturing of biodiesel, ethanol, or food and feed ingredients, or the operation of grain elevators and crop origination and transportation networks.  Prior to the issuance of Shares, you may be required to certify to the Company and provide such other evidence to the Company as the Company may reasonably require that you have not engaged in any activities that compete with the business operations of the Company and its Affiliates since you ceased to be an Employee due to Retirement or Disability. 
    
  (c)      Compensation Recovery Policy  .  To the extent that this Award and any compensation associated therewith is considered  incentive-based compensation  within the meaning and subject to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, this Award and any compensation associated therewith shall be subject to potential forfeiture or recovery by the Company in accordance with any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee in response to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Company s Shares are then listed.

The delivery of Shares in settlement of Restricted Stock Units shall be conditioned upon the prior payment by you, or the establishment of arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment by you, of all such withholding tax obligations.  You hereby authorize the Company (or the Affiliate that employs you) to withhold from salary or other amounts owed to you any sums required to satisfy withholding tax obligations in connection with the Award.  If you wish to satisfy such withholding tax obligations by delivering Shares you already own or by having the Company retain a portion of the Shares that would otherwise be issued to you in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, you must make such a request which shall be subject to approval by the Company.  If payment of withholding tax obligations, or  
  
   4 

satisfactory payment arrangements, are not made on a timely basis, the Company may instruct an authorized broker to sell such number of Shares subject to the Award as are equal in value to the tax withholding obligations prior to the issuance of any Shares to you. 
    
  Section 9  .      Securities Law Compliance  .  No Shares shall be delivered upon the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units unless and until the Company and/or you shall have complied with all applicable federal, state or foreign registration, listing and/or qualification requirements and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, unless the Committee has received evidence satisfactory to it that you may acquire such shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the applicable securities laws.  Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final, binding, and conclusive.  The Company reserves the right to legend any Share certificate or book entry, conditioning sales of such Shares upon compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations. 
    
  Section 10  .      No Rights as Employee or Consultant  .  Nothing in this Agreement or this Award shall confer upon you any right to continue as an Employee or consultant of the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate your service at any time. 
    
  Section 11  .      Adjustments  .  If at any time while this Award is outstanding, the number of outstanding Shares is changed by reason of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split or any of the other events described in Section 4.3 of the Plan, the number of Restricted Stock Units and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of such Units shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 
    
  Section 12  .      Notices  .  Any notice hereunder by you shall be given to the Company in writing and such notice shall be deemed duly given only upon receipt thereof by the Secretary of the Company at the Company s office at 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526, or at such other address as the Company may designate by notice to you.

  Section 13  .      Construction  .  The construction of the Notice and these Terms and Conditions is vested in the Committee, and the Committee s construction shall be final and conclusive.  The Notice and these Terms and Conditions are subject to the provisions of the Plan, and to all interpretations, rules and regulations which may, from time to time, be adopted and promulgated by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.

  These Terms and Conditions are part of a Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the  Agreement ) that governs a Restricted Stock Unit Award made to you as an employee of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the  Company ) or one of its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of the Company s 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the  Plan ).  The Agreement consists of a notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award that has been provided to you (the  Notice ), these Terms and Conditions and the applicable terms of the Plan which are incorporated into the Agreement by reference, including the definitions of capitalized terms contained in the Plan. 
    
  Section 1  .      Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Award  .  The grant of this Restricted Stock Unit Award to you is effective as of the Date of Grant specified in the Notice.  This Restricted Stock Unit Award provides you the number of Restricted Stock Units specified in the Notice, each such Restricted Stock Unit representing the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock. 
    
  Section 2  .      Rights of the Recipient  . 
    
  (a)      No Shareholder Rights  .  The Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Award do not entitle you to any rights of a shareholder of the Company s common stock.  Your rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units shall remain forfeitable at all times by you until satisfaction of the vesting conditions set forth in Section 3. 
    
  (b)      Restrictions on Transfer  .  You shall not be entitled to transfer, sell, pledge, alienate, hypothecate or assign the Restricted Stock Units or this Award, except that in the event of your death, your estate shall be entitled to the Shares represented by the Restricted Stock Units.  Any attempt to otherwise transfer the Restricted Stock Units or this Award shall be void.  All rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units and this Award shall be available only to you during your lifetime, and thereafter to your estate. 
    
  (c)       Dividend Equivalents  .  As of each date that the Company pays a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock generally, the Company shall pay you an amount equal to the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its common stock on that date multiplied by the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to you under this Award as of the related dividend payment record date.  No such dividend equivalent payment shall be made with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, as of such record date, have either been settled as provided in Section 4 or forfeited pursuant to Sections 5 or 7 below.  Any such payment shall be made as soon as practicable after the related dividend payment date, but no later than the later of (i) the end of the calendar year in which the dividend payment date occurs, or (ii) the 15th day of the third calendar month after the dividend payment date. 
    
  Section 3  .      Vesting  .  Subject to the provisions of Section 7 below, the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award and your right to receive Shares in settlement thereof shall vest in full on the scheduled vesting date specified in the Notice, or at such earlier time as may be specified in Section 5 or Section 6 below (the date upon which such vesting occurs being referred to as the  Vesting Date ). 
    
  Section 4  .      Settlement of Restricted Stock Units  .

Such issuance shall be evidenced by a stock certificate or appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, shall be subject to the tax withholding provisions of Section 8 below, and shall be in complete satisfaction of such vested Restricted Stock Units.  If the Restricted Stock Units that vest include a fractional Restricted Stock Unit, the Company shall round the number of vested Restricted Stock Units to the nearest whole unit prior to issuance of Shares as provided herein.  If the ownership of or issuance of Shares to you as provided herein is not feasible due to applicable exchange controls, securities or tax laws or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, you or your legal representative shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (as of the Vesting Date) of the Shares otherwise issuable to you, net of any amount required to satisfy withholding tax obligations as provided in Section 8 below. 
    
  Section 5  .      Effect of Termination of Service  .   
    
  (a)      Termination of Employment Generally  . If, prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Section 3, you cease to be an Employee for any reason (voluntary or involuntary) other than (i) death or Disability, or (ii) Retirement (as defined below), then your rights to the unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited on the date of termination.  
    
  (b)      Death or Permanent Long-Term Disability  .  If you cease to be an Employee as a result of death, then all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award and your right to receive Shares in settlement thereof shall fully vest and the Company shall settle such Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Section 4 above.  If you cease to be an Employee as a result of Disability, then subject to the forfeiture conditions of Section 7 below, the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award and your right to receive Shares in settlement thereof shall continue to vest in accordance with Section 3 above. 
    
  (c)      Retirement  .  If you cease to be an Employee as a result of Retirement, then subject to the forfeiture conditions of Section 7 below, the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award and your right to receive Shares in settlement thereof shall continue to vest in accordance with Section 3 above.   Retirement  means any termination of employment at or after age sixty-five (65), or at or after age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more years of continuous service as defined under the ADM Retirement Plan, a copy of which can be acquired upon request.

  (a)      Termination After a Change of Control  .  If, within 24 months after a Change of Control (i) described in paragraphs (a), (d) or (e) of Section 2.7 of the Plan or (ii) that constitutes a Business Combination as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 2.7 of the Plan and in connection with which the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity) has continued, assumed or replaced this Restricted Stock Unit Award, you cease to be an Employee due either to an involuntary termination for reasons other than Cause (as defined in Section 7(b) below) or a resignation for Good Reason (as defined in Section 6(d) below), then all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award and your right to receive Shares in settlement thereof shall immediately vest in full and will be settled in shares of Company common stock as provided in Section 4 above. 
    
  (b)      Award Not Continued, Assumed or Replaced  .  If this Restricted Stock Unit Award is not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Change of Control that constitutes a Business  
  
   2 

Combination as contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 6(a) above, then all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award and your right to receive Shares in settlement thereof shall immediately vest in full upon the occurrence of the Change of Control and will be settled in shares of Company common stock as provided in Section 4 above.  Unless the Committee provides otherwise in connection with a Change of Control described in paragraph (b) of Section 2.7 of the Plan, all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award shall vest in full prior to the consummation of the dissolution or liquidation. 
    
  (c)      Assumption or Replacement  .  For purposes of this Section 6, this Restricted Stock Unit Award will be considered assumed or replaced if, in connection with the Change of Control transaction and in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A, either (i) the contractual obligations represented by this Award are expressly assumed by the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity) with appropriate adjustments to the number and type of securities subject to this Award that preserves the intrinsic value of this Award existing at the time of the Change of Control transaction, or (ii) you have received a comparable restricted stock unit award that preserves the intrinsic value of this Award existing at the time of the Change of Control transaction and is subject to substantially similar terms and conditions as this Award.   
    
  (d)      Good Reason  .  For purposes of this Agreement,  Good Reason  shall have the meaning specified in your employment agreement with the Company or an Affiliate, or, if you are not employed pursuant to an employment agreement or are party to an employment agreement that does not define the term,  Good Reason  shall mean any of the following events that occurs without your prior written consent: 
    
  (i)    you experience a material diminution in your employment duties, authority or responsibilities as compared to your duties, authority and responsibilities as in effect during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control; 
    
  (ii)    you experience a material diminution in your compensation as compared to your compensation as in effect during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control, or as the same may have been increased from time to time thereafter;  
    
  (iii)    you are required to be based at any office or location that is in excess of 50 miles from the principal location of your work during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control; or 
    
  (iv)    any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or an Affiliate of any agreement under which you provide services to the Company or such Affiliate. 
    
  Before a resignation by you will constitute a resignation for Good Reason, you must give the Company or applicable Affiliate a notice of resignation within 30 calendar days of the occurrence of the event alleged to constitute Good Reason.  The notice must set forth in reasonable detail the specific reason for the resignation and the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for concluding that such resignation is for Good Reason.  Failure to provide such notice within such 30-day period shall be conclusive proof that you do not have Good Reason to terminate employment.  In addition, Good Reason shall exist only if the Company or applicable Affiliate fails to remedy the event or events constituting Good Reason within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of resignation from you.   
    
  Section 7  .      Forfeiture of Award and Compensation Recovery  .   
    
  (a)      Forfeiture Conditions  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you cease to be an Employee because your employment is terminated for  Cause  (as defined in paragraph 7(b)

  (b)      Definition of  Cause   .  For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean the Company s good faith determination that you have engaged in any act that creates just cause for termination, which, without limiting the foregoing, shall be deemed to include the following: (i) any act of dishonesty with respect to your responsibilities as an Employee, embezzlement, misappropriation, intentional fraud, or other violations of the law or similar conduct by you involving the Company or any Affiliate, (ii) any acts resulting in a conviction for, or plea of guilty or   nolo     contendere   to, a charge of commission of a felony, (iii) misconduct resulting in injury to the Company or any Affiliate, (iv) activities harmful to the reputation of the Company or any Affiliate, (v) a violation of Company or Affiliate operating guidelines or policies, (vi) willful refusal to perform, or substantial disregard of, the duties properly assigned to you, including failure to provide your Best Efforts on behalf of the Company or any Affiliate, (vi) a violation of any contractual, statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company or any Affiliate; (vii) any breach of your obligations to the Company or any Affiliate, including any confidentiality or non-disclosure obligations; or (viii) any willful and/or gross misconduct by you that in the good faith determination of the Company demonstrates unfitness to be an employee of the Company or any Affiliate, including the harassment of any employee or violation of any law, regulation, or Company policies.

You hereby authorize the Company (or the Affiliate that employs you) to withhold from salary or other amounts owed to you any sums required to satisfy withholding tax obligations in connection with the Award.  If you wish to satisfy such withholding tax obligations by delivering Shares you already own or by having the Company retain a portion of the Shares that would otherwise be issued to you in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, you must make such a request which shall be subject to approval by the Company.

Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final, binding, and conclusive.  The Company reserves the right to legend any Share certificate or book entry, conditioning sales of such Shares upon compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations. 
    
  Section 10  .      No Rights as Employee or Consultant  .  Nothing in this Agreement or this Award shall confer upon you any right to continue as an Employee or consultant of the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate your service at any time. 
    
  Section 11  .      Adjustments  .  If at any time while this Award is outstanding, the number of outstanding Shares is changed by reason of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split or any of the other events described in Section 4.3 of the Plan, the number of Restricted Stock Units and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of such Units shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

This Agreement, the parties  performance hereunder, and the relationship between them shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to the choice of law principles thereof.  The parties expressly agree that any action relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall take place exclusively in the State of Illinois, and you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and/or state courts in Illinois.  You further consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in both such courts and to service of process by United States Mail or express courier service in any such action. 
    
  Section 15  .      Binding Effect  .  This Agreement will be binding in all respects on your heirs, representatives, successors and assigns, and on the successors and assigns of the Company. 
    
  Section 16  .      Remedies  . The parties expressly agree that the forfeiture and repayment obligations contained within Section 7 above do not constitute the Company s exclusive remedy for your violation of Section 7(c)(i).  The Company may seek any additional legal or equitable remedy, including injunctive relief, for any such violation of that provision.  To the extent that any violation of Section 7(c)(i) shall result in an injunction against you, the parties expressly agree that the Company shall be entitled to obtain and enforce immediately temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and final injunctions without the posting of a bond enjoining such breach or threatened breach. 
    
  Section 17  .      Miscellaneous  . 
    
  (a)      Amendment, Waiver, and Severability  .

If the Company or any Affiliate makes any assignment of the rights and/or obligations herein or transfers your employment or relationship within the Company or any Affiliate, you agree that this Agreement shall remain binding upon you.  
  
   7 

(c)      Acceptance  .  You agree that this Agreement is accepted by you through your original, electronic or facsimile signature.

I, R. G. Young, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
