  Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) (continued) 
    
  (1) Included in Belmond Ltd. s consolidated assets and liabilities are assets of consolidated variable interest entities ( consolidated VIEs ) that can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIEs and liabilities of consolidated VIEs whose creditors have no recourse to Belmond Ltd. The Company s only consolidated VIE at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is Charleston Center LLC. These assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows:

1.    Basis of financial statement presentation 
    
  Business 
    
  The terms  Belmond  and the  Company  are used in this report to refer to Belmond Ltd. and Belmond Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Belmond owned, invested in or managed   34   deluxe hotels and resort properties operating in the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Europe, Southern Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia,   one   stand-alone restaurant in New York,    seven   tourist trains in Europe, Southeast Asia and Peru,   two   river cruise businesses in Myanmar (Burma) and   one   canal boat business in France. 
    
  Basis of presentation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for quarterly reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim period have been included in these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The interim results presented are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent interim period or the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding significant accounting policies. 
    
  For interim reporting purposes, Belmond calculates its tax expense by estimating its global annual effective tax rate and applies that rate in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis. Belmond has calculated an expected annual effective tax rate, excluding significant or unusual items, and the tax effect of jurisdictions with losses for which a tax benefit cannot be recognized. The income tax expense (or benefit) related to all other items is individually computed and recognized when the items occur. 
    
  Accounting policies 
    
  The accounting policies used in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied in the prior year. 
    
  Accounting pronouncements adopted during the period 
    
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance which amends consolidation requirements and changes the analysis required in relation to variable interest entities and whether or not these entities should be consolidated. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on Belmond s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

     Table of Contents  

Accounting pronouncements to be adopted 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance which is intended to improve the comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets. The guidance supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the new guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in the original accounting pronouncement. In May 2016, the FASB issued an update that clarified guidance in certain narrow aspects of the topic. The guidance was originally effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, however in July 2015 the FASB confirmed that the effective date would be deferred by one year, to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Belmond is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements. Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern . The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. Belmond is assessing what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on its disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued its new standard on accounting for leases, which introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. A distinction between finance leases and operating leases is retained, with the result that the effect of leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous lease guidance.  The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Belmond is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Some elements of the new guidance are applicable on a prospective basis, some elements on a retrospective basis and some using a modified retrospective transition method. Belmond is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis where applicable. Belmond is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which is intended to simplify the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers. The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2017, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis. Belmond is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

The total number of share options and share-based awards excluded from computing diluted earnings per share was as follows:  

The number of share options and share-based awards unexercised at   September 30, 2016   was   4,028,279   (  September 30, 2015   -   3,770,944  ).

3.    Assets held for sale and discontinued operations 

(a)    Results of discontinued operations 
    
  Belmond had been operating the hotel Ubud Hanging Gardens under a long-term lease arrangement with a third-party owner. The existing lease arrangement continues to 2030. Following the owner's unannounced dispossession of Belmond from the hotel in November 2013, however, Belmond was unable to continue to operate the hotel. Belmond believed that the owner's actions were unlawful and constituted a wrongful dispossession and has pursued its legal remedies under the lease. See Note 17. As Belmond is unable to operate Ubud Hanging Gardens for the foreseeable future, the hotel has been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods shown. The assets and liabilities of the hotel have not been classified as held for sale, as the hotel has not been disposed of through a sale transaction. 
    
  The Porto Cupecoy development was sold in January 2013, with the final unit disposed of in September 2014. Residual costs relating to the sale of Porto Cupecoy are presented within discontinued operations for all periods shown. 
    
  Summarized operating results of the properties classified as discontinued operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

12 

     Table of Contents  

The results of discontinued operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included   $73,000   due to the partial release of legal fee accruals in relation to Ubud Hanging Gardens, where Belmond is pursuing legal remedies following its dispossession by the owner in November 2013. See Note 17. The results of discontinued operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   comprised legal fees of   $338,000   and   $530,000  , respectively, in relation to Ubud Hanging Gardens. 
    
  (b)    Assets and liabilities held for sale 
    
  There were   no   assets or liabilities classified as held for sale at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Table of Contents  

4.    Variable interest entities 
    
  (a)    VIEs of which Belmond is the primary beneficiary 
    
  Belmond holds a   19.9%   equity investment in Charleston Center LLC, owner of Belmond Charleston Place, Charleston, South Carolina. Belmond has also made a number of loans to the hotel. Belmond concluded that Charleston Center LLC is a VIE because the total equity at risk is insufficient for the entity to fund its operations without additional subordinated financial support, the majority of which has been provided by Belmond. Belmond is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because it is expected to absorb a majority of the VIE s expected losses and residual gains through the subordinated financial support it has provided, and has the power to direct the activities that impact the VIE s performance, based on the current organizational structure. 

Assets of Charleston Center LLC that can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIEs and liabilities of Charleston Center LLC whose creditors have no recourse to Belmond are presented as a footnote to the consolidated balance sheets. The third-party debt of Charleston Center LLC is secured by its net assets and is non-recourse to its members, including Belmond. The hotel's separate assets are not available to pay the debts of Belmond and the hotel's separate liabilities do not constitute obligations of Belmond. The assets of Charleston Center LLC that can be used only to settle obligations of Charleston Center LLC totaled   $210,107,000   at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015   -   $210,652,000  ) and exclude goodwill of   $40,395,000   (  December 31, 2015   -   $40,395,000  ). The liabilities of Charleston Center LLC for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Belmond totaled   $122,366,000   at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015   -   $122,386,000  ). 
    
  All deferred taxes attributable to the Company s investment in the LLC arise at the investor level and are therefore not included in the footnote to the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  (b)    VIEs of which Belmond is not the primary beneficiary 
    
  Belmond holds a   25%   equity investment in Eastern and Oriental Express Ltd., which operates the Eastern   Oriental Express luxury tourist train in Southeast Asia. Belmond concluded that the Eastern   Oriental Express joint venture is a variable interest entity because the total equity at risk is insufficient for it to fund its operations without additional subordinated financial support. Belmond is not the primary beneficiary of the joint venture because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in earnings/(losses) before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated companies in the statements of consolidated operations. 
    
  The carrying amounts and maximum exposure to loss as a result of Belmond's involvement with its Eastern   Oriental Express joint venture are as follows: 

5.    Investments in unconsolidated companies 
    
  Investments in unconsolidated companies represent equity interests of   50%   or less and in which Belmond exerts significant influence, but does not have effective control of these unconsolidated companies and, therefore, accounts for these investments using the equity method. As at   September 30, 2016  , these investments include the   50%   ownership in rail and hotel joint venture operations in Peru, the   25%   ownership in Eastern and Oriental Express Ltd, and the Buzios land joint venture which is   50%   owned and is further described below.

     Table of Contents  

In June 2007, a joint venture in which Belmond holds a   50%   equity interest acquired real estate in Buzios, a beach resort area in Brazil, for a cash consideration of   $5,000,000  . Belmond planned to build a hotel and villas on the acquired land and to purchase the remaining share of the joint venture company when the building permits were obtained from the local authorities. In February 2009, the Municipality of Buzios commenced a process for the expropriation of the land in exchange for a payment of fair compensation to the joint venture. In April 2011, the State of Rio de Janeiro took over the expropriation process as part of a broader State plan to develop a large environmental park. Under applicable law, the State had   five   years to carry out the expropriation in exchange for fair value, which it has failed to do by the April 18, 2016 deadline. As a result, the land returns unencumbered to the joint venture, although it can be subject to expropriation again after a period of   one   year. The Company and its joint venture partner are assessing their options, including negotiation with or litigation against the State to seek a permanent resolution of the status of the land, but in any case, the Company expects to recover its investment in the project. 
    
  On May 21, 2015, Belmond sold its   50%   ownership in Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain. Belmond and its joint venture partner sold the shares in the entity that owns the hotel for gross proceeds of    130,000,000   (  $144,529,000   at date of sale). As a condition of the sale, Belmond s management contract with Hotel Ritz by Belmond was terminated, resulting in the receipt of a termination fee of   $2,292,000   and a gain of   $19,676,000  . 

Summarized financial data for Belmond s unconsolidated companies are as follows:  

1      Gross profit is defined as revenues less cost of services of the unconsolidated companies. 
   2      There were no discontinued operations or cumulative effects of a change in an accounting principle in the unconsolidated companies. 

15 

     Table of Contents  

Included in unconsolidated companies are Belmond s hotel and rail joint ventures in Peru, under which Belmond and the other   50%   participant must contribute equally additional equity needed for the businesses. If the other participant does not meet this obligation, Belmond has the right to dilute the other participant and obtain a majority equity interest in the affected joint venture company. Belmond also has rights to purchase the other participant s interests, which rights are exercisable in limited circumstances such as the other participant s bankruptcy. 
    
  There are contingent guarantees to unconsolidated companies which are not recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The contingent guarantees for each Peruvian joint venture may only be enforced in the event there is a change in control of the relevant joint venture, which would occur only if Belmond s ownership of the economic and voting interests in the joint venture falls below   50%  , an event which has not occurred. As at   September 30, 2016  , Belmond does not expect that it will be required to fund these guarantees relating to these joint venture companies. 
    
  Belmond has contingently guaranteed,   through 2020  ,   $18,201,000   of debt obligations of the joint venture in Peru that operates   four   hotels and has contingently guaranteed the Peru rail joint venture s obligations relating to the performance of its governmental rail concessions, currently in the amount of   $7,261,000  ,   through May 2017  . 
    
  Previously, Belmond had guaranteed   $4,124,000   of the debt obligations of the rail joint venture in Peru. The guaranteed debt was repaid by the joint venture in the year ended December 31, 2015.  

6.    Property, plant and equipment 
    
  The major classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows:   

The depreciation charge on property, plant and equipment for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $13,038,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $12,057,000  ) and   $39,165,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $36,839,000  ), respectively.  
    
  The table above includes property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation,  of Charleston Center LLC, a consolidated VIE, of   $201,751,000   at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015   -   $201,342,000  ). 
    
  In the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Belmond identified and recorded a non-cash property, plant and equipment impairment charge of   $1,007,000   in respect of Belmond Orcaella, a cruise ship in Myanmar under long-tern charter. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Belmond considered whether the decline in performance of Belmond Orcaella caused by increased competition in Myanmar indicated that the carrying amount of the business  fixed assets may not be recoverable. Belmond concluded that an impairment trigger existed and an impairment test was required. The carrying value of assets was written down to fair value based on management s best estimate of the recoverable value. The impairment charge is included within impairment of property, plant and equipment in the statements of condensed consolidated operations. 
    
  There were   no   impairments of property, plant and equipment in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In the current quarter, Belmond considered whether the decline in performance of Belmond Northern Belle caused by a reduction in passenger numbers sourced mainly from regional markets in the U.K. indicated that the carrying amount of Belmond Northern Belle s fixed assets may not be recoverable. Belmond concluded that an impairment trigger existed and an impairment test was required. Under the first step of the fixed assets impairment test, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from

Belmond Northern Belle was in excess of its carrying value. The impairment test remains sensitive to changes in assumptions; factors that could reasonably be expected to potentially have an adverse effect on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group include the future operating projections of the train, particularly passenger numbers, ticket prices and maintenance spend, and any deterioration in the U.K. regional economy. 
    
  There was   no   capitalized interest in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

7.    Goodwill 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Belmond considered whether increased competition in the Asia region indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of Belmond La R sidence d Angkor was less than its carrying value. The property was tested for goodwill impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Under the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the fair value of Belmond La R sidence d Angkor was approximately   15%   in excess of its carrying value. The goodwill balance of Belmond La R sidence d Angkor is   $1,548,000   at   September 30, 2016  . Belmond concluded that there was   no   impairment trigger in the current quarter as the hotel is currently closed for refurbishment until November 2016, and so will continue to carefully monitor the situation and perform an impairment test once the hotel reopens and the post-refurbishment projections can be ascertained. Factors that could reasonably be expected to potentially have an adverse effect on the fair value of the reporting unit include the future operating projections of the hotel, volatility in debt or equity markets that could result in changes to the discount rate, political instability in the region or changes in future travel patterns or local competitive supply.

8.    Other intangible assets 
    
  Other intangible assets consist of the following as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Favorable lease intangible assets are amortized over the terms of the leases, which are between   19   and   60 years  . Internet sites are amortized over a period of   five   to   ten years  . Trade names have an indefinite life and therefore are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment annually or when events indicate that impairment may have occurred. 
    
  Total amortization expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $117,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $123,000  ) and   $388,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $345,000  ), respectively. Estimated total amortization expense for the remainder of the year ending   December 31, 2016   is   $129,000   and for each of the years ending December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2020 is   $517,000  .

9.    Debt and obligations under capital lease 
    
  (a)    Long-term debt and obligations under capital lease 
    
  Long-term debt and obligations under capital lease consist of the following: 

Belmond is financed with a   $551,955,000   secured term loan and a   $105,000,000   revolving credit facility. 
    
  The term loan has two tranches, a U.S. dollar tranche (  $345,000,000   initial amount) and a euro-denominated tranche (   150,000,000    initial amount, equivalent to   $206,955,000   at drawdown). The dollar tranche bears interest at a rate of   LIBOR   plus   3%   per annum, and the euro tranche originally had an interest rate of   EURIBOR   plus   3.25%   per annum. The euro-denominated tranche was repriced in June 2015 to a rate of   EURIBOR   plus   3%   per annum. Both tranches are subject to a   1%   interest rate floor. The term loan matures in   2021   and the annual mandatory amortization is   1%   of the principal amount.  
  The revolving credit facility has a maturity of   five years   and bears interest at a rate of   LIBOR   plus   2.75%   per annum, with a commitment fee of   0.4%   paid on the undrawn amount. 
  The term loan and revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of shares in certain Company subsidiaries and by security interests in tangible and intangible personal property. There are no mortgages over real estate. 
    
  In August 2014, Charleston Center LLC entered into an   $86,000,000   loan secured on its real and personal property. This loan had no amortization and was non-recourse to Belmond. The loan had a   2019   maturity and bore interest at a rate of   LIBOR   plus   2.12%   per annum. In June 2016, Charleston Center LLC refinanced this loan with a   $112,000,000   new loan with the same   2019   maturity. The interest rate on the new loan is   LIBOR   plus   2.35%   per annum, has no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. The additional proceeds were used to repay a 1984 development loan from a public agency in the principal amount of   $10,000,000   and accrued interest of   $16,819,000  . Due to the early settlement of this borrowing a discount was negotiated resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of   $1,200,000   after accounting for a tax indemnity of   $2,800,000   to our partners in respect of their income from the discount arising on the cancellation of indebtedness.

  (b)                                    Revolving credit and working capital facilities 
    
  Belmond had approximately   $105,920,000   of revolving credit and working capital facilities at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015   -   $106,082,000  ) of which   $105,920,000   was available (  December 31, 2015   -   $106,082,000  ). 

10.    Other liabilities 
    
  The major balances in other liabilities are as follows:

Table of Contents  

11.    Pensions 
    
  Components of net periodic pension benefit cost are as follows: 

From January 1, 2003, a number of non-U.S. Belmond employees participated in a funded defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom called the Belmond (UK) Ltd. 2003 Pension Scheme. On May 31, 2006, the plan was closed for future benefit accruals. 
    
  A U.K. subsidiary of Belmond is obligated to the plan s trust to pay    1,272,000   (equivalent to   $1,654,000   at   September 30, 2016  ) annually until the plan is fully funded, which, based on its December 2012 actuarial assessment (prepared using assumptions which differ in some respects to those used to value the liability for these financial statements), is projected to occur in   2017  . During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , contributions of   $442,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $487,000  ) and   $1,352,000   (  September 30, 2015   -    $1,450,000  ), respectively, were made to the pension plan and Belmond anticipates contributing an additional   $302,000   to fund the plan in   2016   for a total of   $1,654,000  . 
    
  Once the plan is fully funded, the U.K. subsidiary will remain obligated to restore the plan to a fully funded balance should its position deteriorate. In May 2014, Belmond guaranteed the payment obligations of the U.K. subsidiary through 2023, subject to a cap of    8,200,000   (equivalent to   $10,660,000   at   September 30, 2016  ), which reduces commensurately with every payment made to the plan since December 31, 2012. 

12.    Income taxes 
    
  In the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the income tax provision was   $20,401,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $11,355,000  ) and   $25,140,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $18,413,000  ), respectively. The increase in tax charge in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is mainly as a result of an increase in earnings from operations.  
    
  Following settlements agreed in October 2016, the Company expects that its liability for uncertain tax positions will reduce by approximately   $3,500,000   in the fourth quarter of 2016.

14.    Supplemental cash flow information 

To reflect the actual cash paid for capital expenditure to acquire property, plant and equipment, increases in accounts payable for capital expenditure are non-cash and excluded from capital expenditure, while decreases are cash payments and included. The change in accounts payable was a increase of   $113,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   (  September 30, 2015   - decrease of   $881,000  ). 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , cash paid during the period for interest of   $34,020,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $20,948,000  ) included the payment of accrued interest on a 1984 development loan from a public agency that was fully repaid by Charleston Center LLC in June 2016. See Note 9.

  The major balances in restricted cash are as follows: 

Restricted cash classified as long-term and included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   was   $706,000   (  December 31, 2015   -   $749,000  ). 

16.    Share-based compensation plans 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Belmond had   two   share-based compensation plans, the 2004 stock option plan and the 2009 share award and incentive plan. The compensation cost that has been charged to selling, general and administrative expense for these plans for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $2,109,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $1,048,000  ) and   $5,258,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $4,781,000  ), respectively. The total compensation cost related to unexercised options and unvested share awards at   September 30, 2016   to be recognized over the period   October 1, 2016   to   June 30, 2020   was   $9,514,000   and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is   25 months  . Measured from the grant date, substantially all awards of deferred shares and restricted shares have a maximum term of up to   four   years, and substantially all awards of share options have a maximum term of   ten   years. There were no grants under the 2004 stock option plan during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

2009 share award and incentive plan 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the following awards were made under the 2009 share award and incentive plan on the following dates. Estimates of fair values of share options and deferred shares with and without performance criteria were made using the Black-Scholes options pricing model.  

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the following deferred and restricted share awards were made under the 2009 share award and incentive plan on the following dates: 

17.    Commitments and contingencies 
    
  Outstanding contracts to purchase property, plant and equipment were approximately   $9,909,000   at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015   -   $8,662,000  ). 
    
  In February 2013, the State of Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice affirmed a 2011 decision of a Rio state trial court against Sea Containers Ltd ( SCL ) in lawsuits brought against SCL by minority shareholders in Companhia Hoteis Palace ( CHP ), the company that owns Belmond Copacabana Palace, relating to the recapitalization of CHP in 1995, but the Court reduced the total award against SCL to approximately   $27,000,000  . SCL further appealed the judgments during the second quarter of 2013 to the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia. SCL sold its shares in CHP to the Company in 2000. Years later, in 2006, SCL entered insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and Bermuda that are continuing in Bermuda. Possible claims could be asserted against the Company or CHP in connection with this Brazilian litigation that has to date only involved SCL, although no claims have been asserted. As a precautionary measure to defend the hotel, CHP commenced a declaratory lawsuit in the Rio state court in December 2013 seeking judicial declarations that no fraud was committed against the SCL plaintiffs when the shares in CHP were sold to the Company in 2000 and that the sale of the shares did not render SCL insolvent. Pending rulings on those declarations, the court granted CHP an injunction preventing the SCL plaintiffs from provisionally enforcing their 2011 judgments against CHP, which judgment was subsequently reversed on appeal in May 2014. In September 2014, CHP sought reconsideration from the appellate court of this decision, but the court dismissed its request, resulting in the return of the declaratory lawsuit proceedings to the Rio State Court.  Management cannot estimate the range of possible loss if the SCL plaintiffs assert claims against the Company or

CHP, and Belmond has made no accruals in respect of this matter. If any such claims were brought, Belmond would continue to defend its interests vigorously.   
    
  In November 2013, the third-party owner of Ubud Hanging Gardens in Bali, Indonesia dispossessed Belmond from the hotel under long-term lease without prior notice. As a result, Belmond was unable to continue operating the hotel and, accordingly, to prevent any confusion to its guests, Belmond ceased referring to the property in its sales and marketing materials, including all electronic marketing. Belmond believed that the owner's actions were unlawful and in breach of the lease arrangement and constituted a wrongful dispossession. Belmond pursued its legal remedies through arbitration proceedings required under the lease. In June 2015, a Singapore arbitration panel issued its final award in favor of Belmond, holding that the owner had breached Indonesian law and the lease, and granting monetary damages and costs to the Company in an amount equal to approximately   $8,500,000  . Since its receipt of the arbitral award, Belmond has been engaged in the process of enforcing this arbitral award in the Indonesian courts. Starting in April 2014, the Indonesian trial courts have dismissed six separate actions filed by the owner for lack of jurisdiction due to the arbitration clause in the parties  lease. The owner has appealed these decisions, one of which was reversed by the Appellate Court in October 2014. Belmond has appealed this case to the Indonesian Supreme Court. As supplemental proceedings to its arbitration claim, Belmond commenced contempt proceedings in the High Court in London, England, where the owner resided, for pursuing the Indonesian proceedings contrary to an earlier High Court injunction, and obtained against the owner in July 2014 a contempt order, which subsequently resulted in the court issuing a committal order of imprisonment for 120 days. The owner left England before the court order was issued and has not yet served the sentence. Belmond does not believe there is any merit in the owner s outstanding Indonesian actions and is vigorously defending its rights while it seeks to enforce the Singapore arbitral award. While the Company can give no assurances, it believes that it should ultimately be able to enforce its arbitral award. Given the uncertainty involved in this litigation, Belmond recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013, a non-cash impairment charge in the amount of   $7,031,000   relating to long-lived assets and goodwill of Ubud Hanging Gardens and has not booked a receivable in respect of the award.   
    
  In September 2014, the Secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management notified the Company that the Ministry was denying its application to amend the lease for Belmond Hotel das Cataratas, which was entered into in 2007, among other things, to extend the term and reduce the rent. Belmond had applied for the amendment in 2009 based on its claim that it suffered unanticipated and/or unforeseeable costs in performing the refurbishment of the hotel as required by the lease and related tender documentation in order to raise the standard of the property to a five star luxury standard. The Company appealed  to the Secretary to re-consider its decision on both procedural and substantive grounds. Belmond s current annual lease expense for the hotel is   R$18,477,000   (equivalent to   $5,692,000   at   September 30, 2016  ). However, until August 2014, the Company had been paying, with the approval of the Ministry, the amount of   R$11,065,000   (  $3,409,000  ) per annum without an annual adjustment for inflation as provided in the lease, pending resolution of the case. The Company has expensed the full rental amount. Consequently, the difference between the cumulative rental charge and the amount paid plus monetary correction, which totals   R$19,874,000   (  $6,122,000  ), has been fully accrued. Based on the Secretary s decision, the Ministry would assess rent at the contractual rate, which has been included in the table of future rental payments as at   September 30, 2016   below. Beyond the amounts accrued, based on the Secretary s decision, management estimates that the range of possible additional loss to Belmond could be between   R$1,000,000   and   R$1,500,000   (equivalent to   $308,000   and   $462,000   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus interest from the date of the September 2014 decision until a final non-appealable decision is rendered. On March 20, 2015, the Ministry provided notice to the hotel that an aggregate amount of approximately   R$17,000,000   (  $5,238,000  ) was due on March 31, 2015 as a result of the denial of the application. The Secretary has yet to address Belmond s request for re-consideration of the Ministry s decision, so that pending this requested reconsideration and exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Company has not paid to the Ministry the amount claimed due. In the face of the Secretary s failure to conduct its administrative review, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court in Paran  State in August 2016 against the Federal Government of Brazil regarding the Ministry s failure to properly consider and modify the lease concession for Belmond Hotel das Cataratas. The Federal Court granted the Company s request for an injunction against the Government enforcing its claim in the amount of   $6,122,000   and granted the Company s request for a   25%   preliminary reduction in rent, pending a decision on the merits, which the Superior Court upheld on appeal in a decision rendered in September 2016. The Federal Government has appealed this decision to a three judge panel of the Superior Court, which should issue its decision by the end of the first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile a trial calendar has yet to be agreed for the litigation on the merits; however, the Company intends to continue to pursue its claims and contest the Government s claims vigorously. 
     
  In January 2015, Peru Belmond Hotels S.A. received notification of a claim filed by the Public Prosecutor's office of the Regional Government of Cusco, seeking annulment of a contract and public deed of amendment extending the term of the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge concession for   ten years   from May 2015 to May 2025. The claim alleged that the amendment was invalid principally because the President of the Region, who executed the public deed on December 27, 2013, did not have proper authority to execute the amendment because a resolution dismissing him from office had been issued the day before. The court of first instance dismissed the case in May 2015 on technical grounds and the claimant appealed to the Superior Court of Cusco. At a hearing before the Superior Court of Cusco in September 2015, the Superior Court overturned the decision of the court of first instance and declared  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

that the entire proceeding be vacated. The court of first instance reconsidered the matter in January 2016 and again dismissed the Public Prosecutor's claim on technical grounds. The Public Prosecutor's office appealed this decision as well and at a hearing on June 16, 2016, the Superior Court of Cusco reaffirmed the decision of the court of first instance. The Public Prosecutor has declined to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court of Peru. 
    
  The Company is contesting a ruling by an administrative court in Lima, Peru, the location of its Belmond Miraflores Park Hotel ( BMP ), that BMP had violated a municipal nuisance ordinance by generating noise and vibration that disturbed certain owners of apartments in an adjoining residential building. The administrative court levied a nominal fine and ordered as injunctive relief the closure of BMP until the noise and vibration has been eliminated. In March 2016, after the ruling was affirmed by two lower courts, BMP appealed to the Supreme Court of Peru. The relief has been stayed while the appeal process is pending. BMP does not expect to receive a ruling and formal notification from the Supreme Court until at least December 2016. Management believes that the risk of closure of BMP is remote because BMP expects to complete a remediation plan by mid-December 2016 and may also seek to acquire the apartments of the owners who sought the relief. Accordingly, management does not believe that a material loss is probable and no accrual has been made in respect of this matter. 
    
  In July 2015, Cupecoy Village Development N.V. ( Cupecoy ) received notification from the tax authorities in Sint Maarten of an intention to issue tax assessments for periods 2007-2010 in respect of wages taxes, social security, turnover tax and penalties, which Belmond believes indicates a maximum possible loss of   $16,500,000  . Belmond believes that the report received from the tax authorities contains a number of material miscalculations and misinterpretations of fact and law. The Company had provided a written response to the tax authorities disputing their assessment and expected the resolution of this dispute to result in only an immaterial cost. However, the tax authorities consistently failed to respond or otherwise engage in any way with Belmond or Cupecoy and therefore the Company gave the tax authorities notice that it intended to wind up Cupecoy, which the Company did after receiving no response from the authorities to this notice. In October, following our application to the court, Cupecoy was declared technically bankrupt in light of the 2015 tax claim and consequently, the Company believes any liability in respect of Cupecoy has been discharged. 
    
  In May 2010, after prevailing in litigation at the trial and appellate court levels, Belmond settled litigation in the United Kingdom for infringement of its U.K. and Community (European wide) registrations for the  Cipriani  trademark. Defendants paid the amount of   $3,947,000   to Belmond in March 2010 with the balance of   $9,833,000   being payable in installments over   five years   with interest. Belmond received the final payment in the amount of   $1,178,000   in June 2015. Subsequent to Belmond s success before the U.K. courts, there have arisen a number of European trademark opposition and infringement cases relating to Belmond "Cipriani" and "Hotel Cipriani" Community trademarks. These include an ongoing invalidity action filed by Arrigo Cipriani in the European Trade Mark Office ( OHIM ) against Belmond s "Cipriani" Community trademark. To date, Belmond has successfully rebutted this challenge at every level of administrative appeal, and this case is now before the General Court where Belmond also expects to prevail. Belmond has recently been successful in securing the cancellation in Portugal of a trademark application filed by an affiliated company of the Cipriani family for  Cipriani . Belmond has also been successful in obtaining cancellations of "Cipriani" trademark applications made by the Cipriani family's corporate entity in Russia. In addition, there are a number of ongoing trademark disputes with the Cipriani family in Italy: in January 2015, the Cipriani family and affiliated entities commenced proceedings against Belmond in the Court of Venice, asserting that a 1967 agreement pursuant to which the family sold their interest in the Hotel Cipriani constituted a coexistence agreement allowing both the Company to use  Hotel Cipriani  and the Cipriani family to use  Cipriani , and in August 2015, pursuant to a separate claim filed by the Cipriani family, the Court of Venice ruled in favor of the Cipriani family, determining that their use of their full name (rather than just an initial with their surname), would not constitute infringement of the Company s registered trademark. The Court s ruling purports to apply to restaurants on an EU-wide basis (other than the U.K.) rather than only Italy. The Company has appealed this decision. Separate proceedings brought by Belmond in Spain to defend Belmond's marks against a use by the Cipriani family and its affiliated entities of "Cipriani" to promote a restaurant have been stayed pending the outcome of the Venice appeal. While Belmond believes that it has meritorious cases in all of these Italian proceedings, Belmond cannot estimate the range of possible additional loss to Belmond if it should not prevail in any or all of these cases and Belmond has made no accruals in these matters. 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  These proceedings generally include matters relating to labor disputes, tax claims, personal injury cases, lease negotiations and ownership disputes. The outcome of each of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, and the liability that the relevant parties may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently accrued for with respect to these matters. Where a reasonable estimate can be made, the additional losses or range of loss that may be incurred in excess of the amount recognized from the various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business are disclosed separately for each claim, including a reference to where it is disclosed. However, for certain of the legal proceedings, management is unable to estimate the loss or range of loss that may result from these claims due to the highly complex nature or early stage of the legal proceedings.

Future rental payments as at   September 30, 2016   under operating leases in respect of equipment rentals and leased premises are payable as follows: 

Rental expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   amounted to   $3,491,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $2,514,000  ) and   $9,604,000   (  September 30, 2015   -   $8,101,000  ), respectively.  
    
  Belmond has granted to James Sherwood, a former director of the Company, a right of first refusal to purchase Belmond Hotel Cipriani in Venice, Italy in the event Belmond proposes to sell it. The purchase price would be the offered sale price in the case of a cash sale or the fair market value of the hotel, as determined by an independent valuer, in the case of a non-cash sale. Mr. Sherwood has also been granted an option to purchase the hotel at fair market value if a change in control of the Company occurs. Mr. Sherwood may elect to pay   80%   of the purchase price if he exercises his right of first refusal, or   100%   of the purchase price if he exercises his purchase option, by a non-recourse promissory note secured by the hotel payable in   ten   equal annual installments with interest at   LIBOR  . This right of first refusal and purchase option are not assignable and expire   one year   after Mr. Sherwood s death. These agreements relating to Belmond Hotel Cipriani between Mr. Sherwood and Belmond and its predecessor companies have been in place since 1983 and were last amended and restated in 2005.

     Table of Contents  

During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  (b)    Other financial instruments 
    
  Certain methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments. The carrying amount of current assets and current liabilities as disclosed on the condensed consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments.  
    
  The fair value of Belmond's long-term debt, excluding interest rate swaps and caps, is determined using the contractual cash flows and credit-adjusted discount curves. The fair value of the debt is the present value of those contractual cash flows which are discounted at the current market cost of debt and adjusted for the credit spreads. Credit spreads take into consideration general market conditions, maturity and collateral.  
    
  The estimated carrying values, fair values, and levels of the fair value hierarchy of Belmond's long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

(c)    Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis 
    
  The estimated fair values of Belmond s non-financial assets measured on a non-recurring basis for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:

Credit-risk-related contingent features 
    
  Belmond has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions under which, if Belmond defaults on the debt associated with the hedging instrument, Belmond could also be declared in default in respect of its derivative obligations.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest and an adjustment for non-performance risk, related to these agreements was   $5,728,000   (  December 31, 2015   -   $4,464,000  ). If Belmond breached any of the provisions, it would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of   $5,759,000   (  December 31, 2015   -   $4,513,000  ). 
    
  Non-derivative financial instruments   net investment hedges 
    
  Belmond uses certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Belmond designates its euro-denominated indebtedness as a net investment hedge of long-term investments in its euro-functional subsidiaries. These contracts are included in non-derivative hedging instruments. The notional value of non-derivative hedging instruments was   $163,957,000   at   September 30, 2016  , being a liability of Belmond (  December 31, 2015   -   $160,138,000  ).

     Table of Contents  

Belmond's operating segments are aggregated into   six   reportable segments primarily around the type of service being provided hotels, trains and cruises, and management business/part ownership interests and are secondarily organized by geography for the hotels, as follows: 

Owned hotels in each of Europe, North America and Rest of world which derive earnings from the hotels that Belmond owns including its   one   stand-alone restaurant; 
                
    Owned trains and cruises which derive earnings from the train and cruise businesses that Belmond owns;  
                
    Part-owned/managed hotels which derive earnings from hotels that Belmond jointly owns or manages; and 
                
    Part-owned/managed trains which derive earnings from the train businesses that Belmond jointly owns or manages.

Introduction 
    
  Belmond currently owns, partially-owns and/or operates   45   properties (with two additional properties scheduled for future openings over the coming twelve months, Belmond Cadogan Hotel in London, England and the Belmond Andean Explorer train in Peru). 
    
  Belmond has   six   reportable segments: owned hotels in (1) Europe, (2) North America (including one stand-alone restaurant) and (3) Rest of world, (4) Owned trains and cruises, (5) Part-owned/managed hotels and (6) Part-owned/managed trains. 
    
  Belmond revised the order of the presentation of these segments in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and included a new sub-total to show management fees earned by the Company. In addition, Belmond reclassified certain expenses associated with the Company s development team from the Part-owned/managed hotels segment to central costs. Prior periods have been re-presented to reflect the current period presentation.  
    
  Hotels represent the largest part of Belmond s business with the vast majority of the Company's revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively, derived primarily from the Europe, North America and Rest of world segments. 
    
  Hotels in   2016   consisted of   29   deluxe hotels which were wholly or majority owned by Belmond or, in the case of Belmond Charleston Place, owned by a consolidated variable interest entity.   Eleven   of the owned hotels are located in Europe,   five   in North America and   thirteen   in the rest of the world. In addition, Belmond owns and operates the stand-alone restaurant  21  Club in New York which is included within the North America owned hotels segment.  
    
  Belmond's part-owned/managed hotels segment consists of   five   hotels which Belmond operates under management contracts in Peru and the United States. Belmond has unconsolidated equity interests in   four   of the managed hotels. 
    
  In recent years, Belmond has sold to third parties a number of properties not considered key to Belmond s portfolio of unique, high-valued properties as part of management's long-term strategy to reduce leverage and redeploy the capital in properties with higher potential returns. 
    
  In May 2015, Belmond completed the sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain. The gain on sale was reported within gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments in the statements of consolidated operations in the relevant periods. 
    
  Belmond's owned trains and cruises segment consists of   five   European tourist trains,   two   river cruise ships in Myanmar and   one   French canal cruise business. On August 30, 2016, the Company commenced operations of Belmond Grand Hibernian, the first luxury overnight train to travel throughout the island of Ireland.

  Constant currency 
    
  Belmond analyzes certain key financial measures on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements. Measurement on a constant currency basis means the results exclude the effect of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating prior year results at current year exchange rates.

  Overview 
    
    Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  The net earnings attributable to Belmond Ltd. for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $22.9 million   (  $0.23   per common share) on revenue of   $183.7 million  , compared with net earnings of   $10.0 million   (  $0.10   per common share) on revenue of   $168.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in net earnings was partially due to an increase in earnings of $6.1 million at Belmond Copacabana Palace as a result of the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro. This was complemented by solid peak season performances for the Company's Italian hotels resulting in an increase in earnings, and strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. In addition, the Company benefited from a decrease in central  costs due to lower legal and professional fees and payroll savings related to a weaker Great British pound than in the prior-year quarter. In the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $4.1 million, relating to Belmond Grand Hotel Europe ($1.0 million impairment charge of property, plant and equipment related to Belmond Orcaella in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ). 
    
     Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  The net earnings attributable to Belmond Ltd. for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $29.7 million   (  $0.29   per common share) on revenue of   $435.6 million  , compared with net earnings of   $15.9 million   (  $0.15   per common share) on revenue of   $428.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in net earnings was partially due to an increase in earnings at Belmond Copacabana Palace as a result of the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro. This was complemented by solid peak season performances for the Company's Italian hotels resulting in an increase in earnings, and strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. In addition, the improvement in net earnings was partially as a result of a foreign exchange gain of   $9.2 million   recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due to recent volatility in the Great British pound and euro foreign exchange rates, compared with a foreign exchange loss of   $3.5 million   recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was somewhat offset by the gain on disposal of Hotel Ritz by Belmond of $19.7 million in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   compared to a $0.8 million gain in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   related to the deferred gain following the March 2014 sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond and the recognition of the gain on sale of the spa building at Belmond Casa de Sierra Nevada. An impairment of property, plant and equipment in Belmond Orcaella of   $1.0 million   was recorded in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to a goodwill impairment charge of   $9.8 million   recorded in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . There was a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $1.2 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   in connection with the early repayment of the development loan at Charleston Center LLC, compared with   no   gain on extinguishment of debt in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Revenue      

Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Total revenue was   $183.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $15.3 million  , or   9%  , from   $168.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Owned hotels revenue was   $159.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $16.9 million   or   12%  , from   $143.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in owned hotels revenue was largely due to a revenue increase of $10.2m in Belmond Copacabana Palace as a result of the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and a revenue increase of $1.8 million in Belmond Safaris, Botswana, following the reopening of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, one of the Company's three safari lodges, which was closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation.This was complemented by solid peak season performances for the Company's Italian hotels and strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. In addition, the North America hotels performed strongly generating revenue increases of $1.3 million. Revenue from owned total trains and cruises was   $19.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.2 million  , or   10%  , from   $21.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , which was largely due to a revenue decrease of $1.7 million at Venice Simplon-Orient-Express following the year-over-year depreciation of the Great British pound against the U.S. dollar  and a revenue decrease of $1.0 million at Belmond Royal Scotsman primarily as a result of operating two fewer trips in the current-year quarter. 
    
    Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Total revenue was   $435.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $6.9 million  , or   2%  , from   $428.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Total owned hotels revenue was   $377.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $8.0 million  , from   $369.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in total hotels revenue was largely due to a revenue increase of $7.5 million in Belmond Copacabana Palace due to the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and a revenue increase of $2.9 million in Belmond Safaris, Botswana, following the reopening of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge which was closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation. This was offset by a revenue decrease at Belmond Hotel Cipriani, Venice, Italy due to a challenging comparable period, with revenue in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year. Revenue from total owned trains and cruises was   $47.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.0 million  , or   4%  , from   $49.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was due to a combined revenue decrease at Belmond Royal Scotsman and Belmond Road to Mandalay of $1.6 million. Revenues at Belmond Royal Scotsman decreased $0.8 million or 13% primarily as a result of operating two fewer trips in the period. Belmond Road to Mandalay, one of the Company s two river cruise ships in Myanmar suffered from a revenue decline of $0.8 million as a result of increased competition in the area.

Owned hotels - Europe    

Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Revenue was   $92.3 million   for the   three months ended      September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $3.0 million  , or   3%  , from   $89.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to solid peak season performances for the Company's Italian hotels complemented by strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. Revenue for the Italian hotels 
  excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $3.0 million over the prior-year quarter mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. This was offset by a decrease in revenue of $1.2 million in Belmond Hotel Cipriani due to a challenging comparable period, with revenue in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year  ,   as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Outside of Italy, the Company recorded meaningful year-over-year increases for Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, St. Petersburg, Russia, Belmond La Residencia, Mallorca, Spain, and Belmond Reid's Palace, Madeira, Portugal, all primarily as a result of driving demand from new markets and enhanced revenue management. Revenue for Belmond Grand Hotel Europe increased $0.9 million or 16% year-over-year largely as a result of RevPAR growth of 28%. The Company continued to drive improved results for Belmond La Residencia, with revenue for the third quarter of 2016 increasing $0.6 million or 8% over the prior year quarter mainly due to 10% RevPAR growth resulting from increased demand for the destination. Revenue for Belmond Reid's Palace increased $0.5 million or 11% over the third quarter of 2015 primarily as a result of an eight percentage point increase in occupancy that largely resulted from continuing to capitalize on increased demand for the destination. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the European owned hotels segment increased to   $839   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $835   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Occupancy increased to   79%   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   76%   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Same store RevPAR increased by   4%   in U.S. dollars, to   $664   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $637   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   5%   on a constant currency basis. 
    
    Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Revenue was   $172.8 million   for the    nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.2 million   from   $173.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to a revenue decrease of $4.2 million or 13% at Belmond Hotel Cipriani partially due to a challenging comparative period, with revenue for  2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, and the final receipt of $1.1 million income related to the 2010 settlement of the Cipriani trademark litigation. Partially offsetting this decline, Belmond Reid's Palace increased revenue by $2.3 million or 18% due to occupancy growth as a result of capitalizing on increased demand for the destination. In addition, revenue for the Italian hotels excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $2.9 million over the prior-year period mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the European owned hotels segment decreased to   $731   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $751   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Occupancy increased to   67%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   64%   in the   nine months ended      September 30, 2015  . Same store RevPAR increased by   2%   in U.S. dollars, to   $490   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $480   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   4%   on a constant currency basis.

Owned hotels - North America    

Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Revenue was   $30.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $1.3 million  , or   4%  , from   $29.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase was largely attributable to $1.4 million revenue growth at Belmond  Charleston Place, South Carolina. The hotel increased food and beverage revenue by 26% year-over-year largely as a result of a new high-end sports pub that commenced operations in July 2016 and also continued to benefit from improved room product related to the Company's three-year rooms renovation project that was completed in December 2015. ADR for the North American owned hotels segment increased to   $359   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $356   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Occupancy increased to   67%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   65%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Same store RevPAR increased by   3%   to   $241   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $233   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
    Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Revenue was   $108.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $1.7 million  , or   2%  , from   $109.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This decrease was largely attributable to a $1.4 million revenue decline at Belmond Maroma Resort   Spa and a $1.0 million decline in revenue at  21  Club by Belmond. Belmond Maroma Resort   Spa was impacted by increased local competition and the re-opening of renovated hotels in the Los Cabos resort area of Mexico.  21  Club by Belmond was negatively impacted by volatility in stock markets as well as disruption caused by construction noise. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.7 million revenue increase at Belmond Charleston Place. The hotel increased food and beverage revenue largely as a result of a new high-end sports pub that commenced operations in July 2016 and also continued to benefit from improved room product related to the Company's three-year rooms renovation project that was completed in December 2015. ADR for the North American owned hotels segment decreased to   $418   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $425   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Occupancy remained consistent at   69%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . On a same store basis, RevPAR decreased by   2%   to   $287   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $292   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Revenue was   $37.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $12.6 million  , or   52%  , from   $24.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was principally as a result of revenue growth of $10.2 million or 117% at Belmond Copacabana Palace and revenue growth of $1.8 million at Belmond Safaris, Botswana. At Belmond Copacabana Palace, the Company successfully capitalized on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, driving both year-over-year ADR and food and beverage revenue growth of 96% and 96%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2016. Belmond Safaris benefited from being fully operational in the third quarter of 2016, as Belmond Eagle Island Lodge re-opened in December 2015 having been closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the Rest of world owned hotels segment increased to   $479   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $309   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Unfavorable exchange rate movements of $2.5 million resulting from the year-over-year depreciation of the Great British pound against the U.S. dollar, were offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $0.3 million or 1% primarily as a result of Belmond Grand Hibernian, which commenced operations on August 30, 2016 and generated $1.2 million of revenue in its first few weeks of operations. In addition, revenue for Belmond Royal Scotsman was down $0.6 million or 16% primarily as a result of operating two fewer trips in the current-year quarter.

Unfavorable exchange rate movements of $3.7 million resulting from the 9% year-over-year depreciation of the Great British pound against the U.S. dollar, were offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $1.7 million or 4% primarily as a result of Belmond Grand Hibernian, which commenced operations on August 30, 2016 and generated $1.2 million of revenue in its first few weeks of operations. In addition, on a constant currency basis there was a revenue increase of $2.3 million at Venice-Simplon-Orient-Express due to the increase in number of trips in the period. This was offset by a revenue decrease of $0.8 million on a constant currency basis at Belmond Road to Mandalay, one of the Company s river cruise ships in Myanmar, as a result of increased local competition.

  The European owned hotels reported segment earnings of   $45.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $4.5 million  , or   11%  , from earnings of   $41.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to solid peak season performances for the Company's Italian hotels complemented by strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. Earnings for the Italian hotels excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $2.8 million over the prior-year quarter mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. This was offset by a decrease in earnings of $0.5 million in Belmond Hotel Cipriani due to a challenging comparable period, with earnings in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Outside of Italy, the Company recorded meaningful year-over-year increases for Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond La Residencia, and Belmond Reid's Palace, all primarily as a result of driving demand from new markets coupled with enhanced revenue management. Earnings for Belmond Grand Hotel Europe increased $0.7 million or 45% year-over-year largely as a result of RevPAR growth of 28%. The Company continued to drive improved results for Belmond La Residencia, with earnings for the third quarter of 2016 increasing $0.6 million or 17% over the prior year quarter mainly due to 10% RevPAR growth resulting from increased demand for the destination. Earnings for Belmond Reid's Palace increased $0.5 million or 28% over the third quarter of 2015 primarily as a result of an eight percentage point increase in occupancy that largely resulted from continuing to capitalize on increased demand for the destination. As a percentage of European owned hotels revenue, segment profit was   49%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   46%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   due to an improvement in margins earned.  
    
  The North American owned hotels reported segment profit of   $3.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.2 million  , or   7%  , from   $3.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was largely due to a $0.3 million earnings increase at Belmond Maroma Resort   Spa. In 2015, Belmond Maroma Resort   Spa was impacted by increased local competition and the re-opening of renovated hotels in the Los Cabos resort area. In addition, there was a $0.2 million increase in earnings at at Belmond Charleston Place. The hotel increased food and beverage revenue by 26% year-over-year largely as a result of a new high-end sports pub that commenced operations in July 2016 and also continued to benefit from improved room product related to the Company's three-year rooms renovation project that was completed in December 2015.

This was principally as a result of earnings growth of $6.1 million at Belmond Copacabana Palace and earnings growth of $1.2 million at Belmond Safaris. At Belmond Copacabana Palace, the Company successfully capitalized on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, driving both year-over-year ADR and food and beverage revenue growth of 96% and 96%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2016. Belmond Safaris benefited from being fully operational in the third quarter of 2016, as Belmond Eagle Island Lodge was closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation. As a percentage of Rest of world owned hotels revenue, segment profit was   31%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   17%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   due to the high margins earned at Belmond Copacabana Palace.  
    
  The Owned trains and cruises reported segment profit of   $3.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of    $0.6 million  , or   16%  , from earnings of   $3.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was largely due to the earnings decline at Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train following the year-over-year depreciation of the Great British pound against the U.S. dollar. 
    
  The Part-owned/managed hotels reported segment profit of   $2.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.1 million   from earnings of   $2.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .

  The European owned hotels reported segment profit of   $66.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $3.2 million  , or   5%  , from earnings of   $63.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to solid performances for the Company's Italian hotels complemented by strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. Earnings for the Italian hotels excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $2.9 million over the prior-year mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. This was offset by a decrease in earnings of $2.4 million in Belmond Hotel Cipriani due to a challenging comparable period, with earnings in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. The Company also benefited from the final receipt of $1.1 million of settlement income related to the 2010 settlement of the Cipriani trademark litigation. Outside of Italy, the Company recorded meaningful year-over-year increases for Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond La Residencia, and Belmond Reid's Palace, all primarily as a result of driving demand from new markets coupled with enhanced revenue management. Earnings for Belmond Grand Hotel Europe increased $0.6 million or 12% year-over-year largely as a result of RevPAR growth that was primarily the result of continued efforts to stimulate business from new markets. The Company continued to drive improved results for Belmond La Residencia, with earnings for the third quarter of 2016 increasing $1.0 million or 22% over the prior year mainly due to RevPAR growth that largely resulted from increased demand for the destination. Earnings for Belmond Reid's Palace increased $1.5 million or 45% period on period primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy that largely resulted from continuing to capitalize on increased demand for the destination. As a percentage of European owned hotels revenue, segment profit increased to   38%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   36%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The North American owned hotels reported segment profit of   $21.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.0 million  , or   9%  , from   $23.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was largely due to a  $0.7 million decrease in segment profit at Belmond La Samanna, St. Martin due to a year-over-year decrease in call volume due in part to concern over the Zika virus. In addition, there was a $0.5 million earnings decline at Belmond Maroma Resort   Spa due to increased local competition and the re-opening of renovated hotels in the Los Cabos resort area. Belmond El Encanto recorded a decline in earnings of $0.5 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due to a fall in food and beverage revenue and a reduction in group business, primarily as a result of a large buyout in the prior year which did not recur in the current year. As a percentage of North American owned hotels revenue, segment profit was   20%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   21%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The Rest of world owned hotels reported segment profit of   $24.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $6.3 million  , or   34%  , from   $18.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Unfavorable exchange rate movements of $1.7 million resulting from the year-over-year depreciation largely of the Brazilian real and South African rand against the U.S. dollar, were offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $8.3 million, particularly at Belmond Copacabana Palace, Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel and Belmond Safaris. At Belmond Copacabana Palace, the Company successfully capitalized on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, driving year-over-year ADR and food and beverage revenue growth for the third quarter of 2016. Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel achieved strong constant currency ADR growth due to the investments made to renovate the hotel s room product over the past several years. Belmond Safaris recorded an earnings increase of $1.8 million on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the reopening of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, one of the three safari camps in Botswana, which closed for renovations in January 2015. As a percentage of Rest of world owned hotels revenue, segment profit increased to   26%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   21%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to the high margins earned at Belmond Copacabana Palace.  
    
  The Owned trains and cruises reported segment earnings of   $3.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of    $0.6 million  , or   14%  , from earnings of   $4.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was largely due to   an earnings decrease of $0.6 million at Belmond Road to Mandalay, one of the the Company s river cruise ships in Myanmar, as a result of increased local competition. 
    
  The Part-owned/managed hotels reported segment profit of   $4.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an improvement of   $2.2 million   from profit of   $2.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This is primarily due to the sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond in May 2015 which produced segment losses of $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
    
  The Part-owned/managed trains reported segment profit of   $17.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $3.7 million  , or   26%  , from   $14.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily due to the Company s PeruRail joint venture commencing transport of copper concentrate from the Las Bambas mine, which began production in January 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  Belmond s primary short-term cash needs include payment of compensation, general business expenses, capital commitments and contractual payment obligations, which include principal and interest payment on its debt facilities. Long-term liquidity needs may include existing and ongoing property refurbishments, potential investment in strategic acquisitions, and the repayment of long-term debt. At   September 30, 2016  , total debt and obligations under capital leases, including debt of consolidated variable interest entities, amounted to   $613.5 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $596.5 million  ), including a current portion of   $5.4 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $5.3 million  ). See Note 9 to the Financial Statements. Additionally, Belmond had capital commitments at   September 30, 2016   amounting to   $9.9 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $8.7 million  ).  
    
  Belmond had cash and cash equivalents of   $177.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $135.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . In addition, Belmond had restricted cash balances of   $6.1 million  , of which   $5.4 million   is classified as current restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets and   $0.7 million   is classified in other assets (  December 31, 2015   -   $3.3 million  , of which   $2.6 million   was classified in restricted cash and   $0.7 million   was classified in other assets). At   September 30, 2016  , there were undrawn amounts available to Belmond under committed lines of credit of   $105.9 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $106.1 million  ), bringing total cash availability at   September 30, 2016   to   $283.8 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $241.7 million  ), excluding restricted cash. When assessing cash and cash equivalents within Belmond, management considers the availability of those cash resources held within local business units to meet the strategic needs of Belmond.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Belmond had   $5.4 million   of scheduled debt repayments due within one year. Belmond expects to meet these repayments and fund working capital and capital expenditure commitments for the foreseeable future from cash resources, operating cash flow and available committed borrowing. 
    
  In order to ensure that Belmond has sufficient liquidity for the future, Belmond s cash flow projections and available funds are reviewed with the Company s board of directors on a regular basis.  
    
  Recent Events Affecting Belmond s Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On March 23, 2015, Belmond s board of directors announced a program enabling the Company to repurchase its shares of class A common stock up to the value of   $75.0 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Belmond repurchased and retired   233,393   shares of class A common stock at a weighted average price of   $8.54   per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $2.0 million  . The shares repurchased represented approximately   0.2%   of the Company s total shares of class A common stock outstanding prior to the repurchase. To date the Company has acquired   3,574,667   shares of class A common stock for consideration of   $40.0 million  . 
    
  Covenant Compliance 
    
  Belmond is financed with a   $552.0 million   secured term loan and a   $105.0 million   revolving credit facility. The credit agreement limits Belmond s ability to incur additional debt unless certain covenants are met. These covenants are measured on the performance of the consolidated group. The revolving credit facility in the credit agreement contains two financial covenants, a maximum net leverage test and a minimum interest cover test, which are both measured quarterly based on Belmond s trailing 12 months results. 
   If Belmond does not comply with its financial covenants and the banks that provide the revolving credit facility declare a default and accelerate the repayment of their debt, this will cause an event of default under the credit agreement. The cross default threshold in the credit agreement to other debt that is recourse to Belmond is $25.0 million. 
  Belmond continues to closely monitor projected covenant compliance, and if there was a possibility of non-compliance with a covenant, Belmond would proactively meet with the agent or lending bank or banks of the relevant facility to seek an amendment or waiver. Obtaining a waiver may result in additional bank fees or an increase in the interest cost. 
    
  Based on its current financial forecasts, Belmond believes it will comply with all of the financial covenants in its loan facilities.

  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Belmond had cash and cash equivalents of   $177.9 million   and   $135.6 million  , respectively. In addition, Belmond had restricted cash of   $6.1 million   (of which   $5.4 million   was classified as current restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and   $0.7 million   was classified in other assets) and   $3.3 million   (of which   $2.6 million   was classified in restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and   $0.7 million   was classified in other assets) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Operating Activities  . Net cash used in operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $67.9 million  , compared to   $81.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The primary driver of operating cash flows is the result for the period, adjusted for any non-cash components. Net earnings from continuing operations were   $29.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $13.7 million   from net earnings of   $16.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was offset by $14.3 million cash outflow to settle accrued interest on Charleston Center LLC s 1984 development loan from a public agency. See Financing Activities below and Note 9 to the Financial Statements for further information. During the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a gain on disposal of $19.7 million in relation to the sale of Belmond s equity method investment in Hotel Ritz by Belmond, and a goodwill impairment of $9.8 million relating to Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond Jimbaran Puri, Belmond La R sidence Phou Vao and Belmond Northern Belle, non-cash items affecting net cash used in operating activities which did not recur in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Lastly, operating cash flows were affected by the fact that net earnings from continuing operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included a non-cash gain from foreign currency translation of   $9.2 million  , compared to a non-cash loss from foreign currency translation of   $3.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Investing Activities  . Net cash used in investing activities was   $37.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $3.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Capital expenditure to acquire property, plant and equipment of   $40.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included $5.2 million at Belmond Charleston Place related to the cost of adding a new high-end sports pub which opened in July 2016 as well as for roof replacement works, $4.2 million on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express related to statutory maintenance works and the phased installation of air-conditioning, $3.8 million at Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel for the renovation of rooms in the hotel's main building, $3.7 million on the Belmond Grand Hibernian luxury sleeper train which commenced operations in August 2016, $3.6 million at Belmond La Residence d Angkor primarily for a rooms renovation project, with the balance being for routine capital expenditures. 
    
  Capital expenditure to acquire property, plant and equipment of   $42.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   included $8.4 million at Belmond Charleston Place primarily for the hotel s rooms renovation project, $4.5 million at Belmond 
  Safaris primarily for the renovation of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, $4.1 million at Belmond Grand Hotel Europe primarily for 
  the renovation of the hotel s main kitchen and new restaurant, $3.3 million for construction of the Grand Hibernian luxury sleeper 
  train, $3.0 million at Belmond Hotel Cipriani primarily for the renovation of 16 rooms in the hotel s main building, $2.2 million 
  at Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel primarily for the renovation of banqueting and meeting rooms, $2.1 million at Belmond Hotel Splendido primarily for the refurbishment of ten rooms, $2.0 million at Belmond Villa San Michele primarily for a new function 
  facility, $2.0 million on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and Belmond British Pullman primarily related to statutory safety works, $2.0 million at Belmond La Residencia primarily for a new bar and refurbishment of 12 junior suites and $1.7 million at 
  Belmond Villa Sant Andrea primarily to purchase an adjacent property and beach concession, with the balance being for routine capital expenditures. 
    
  In addition, during the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015, disposal of Belmond s equity method investment in Hotel Ritz by Belmond resulted in net cash proceeds of $43.7 million. The disposal resulted in a gain of $19.7 million which was recognized on completion and reported within gain on sale from property, plant and equipment and equity method investments.  
    
  Financing Activities  . Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $11.1 million  , compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $32.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Charleston Center LLC refinanced its   $86.0 million   loan secured on its real and personal property with an amended   $112.0 million   loan. The additional proceeds of $26.0 million was largely used to repay a 1984 development loan from a public agency in the principal amount of   $10.0 million   and accrued interest of   $16.8 million  .  There was a cash outflow of $22.8 million to repay this loan and accrued interest, reflecting a discount of $4.0 million which was negotiated due to the early settlement of this liability. The net gain on extinguishment of debt reported in the statements of condensed consolidated operations was   $1.2 million   after accounting for a tax indemnity of   $2.8 million   to our partners. Including this refinancing,  principal repayments under long-term debt were therefore   $12.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $4.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  In addition, the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included a cash outflow of   $2.0 million   in relation to repurchases of Belmond s shares of class A common stock, compared to   $27.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations.   The results of Ubud Hanging Gardens and Porto Cupecoy have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.   
    
  Capital Commitments 
    
  Belmond routinely makes capital expenditures to enhance its business. These capital expenditures relate to maintenance, improvements to existing properties and investment in new properties. These capital commitments are expected to be funded through current cash balances, cash flows from operations and existing debt facilities. 
    
  There were   $9.9 million   of capital commitments outstanding at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015   -   $8.7 million  ) relating to project developments and refurbishment for existing properties. 
    
  Indebtedness 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Belmond had   $613.5 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $596.5 million  ) of consolidated debt and obligations under capital leases, including the current portion and including debt held by consolidated variable interest entities. Total debt on the consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   is net of the unamortized original issue discount of   $1.6 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $1.9 million  ) and unamortized debt issuance costs of   $10.2 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $11.7 million  ), both of which will be amortized through interest expense over the term of the loans. 
    
  Belmond is financed with a   $552.0 million   secured term loan and a   $105.0 million   revolving credit facility. 
    
  The term loan has two tranches, a U.S. dollar tranche (  $345.0 million   initial amount) and a euro-denominated tranche (   150.0 million   initial amount, equivalent to   $207.0 million   at drawdown). The dollar tranche bears interest at a rate of   LIBOR   plus   3%   per annum, and the euro tranche originally had an interest rate of   EURIBOR   plus   3.25%   per annum. The euro-denominated tranche was repriced in June 2015 to a rate of   EURIBOR   plus   3%   per annum. Both tranches are subject to a   1%   interest rate floor. The term loan matures in   2021   and the annual mandatory amortization is   1%   of the principal amount.  
  The revolving credit facility has a maturity of   five years   and bears interest at a rate of   LIBOR   plus   2.75%   per annum, with a commitment fee of   0.4%   paid on the undrawn amount. At   September 30, 2016   the facility was undrawn and including other working capital facilities, the Company has   $105.9 million   available to draw. 
  The term loan and revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of shares in certain Company subsidiaries and by security interests in tangible and intangible personal property. There are no mortgages over real estate. 
    
  The weighted average duration of Belmond s debt, including debt held by consolidated variable interest entities, is   4.1 years  , and the weighted average interest rate is   4.26%   which incorporates the effect of derivatives which are used to mitigate interest rate risk. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements regarding the maturity of long-term debt. 
    
  Debt of consolidated variable interest entities at   September 30, 2016   included above comprised   $113.2 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $97.3 million  ), including the current portion but before deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs, of debt obligations of Charleston Center LLC, owner of Belmond Charleston Place in which Belmond has a 19.9% equity investment.  
    
  In June 2016, Charleston Center LLC amended its secured loan of   $86.0 million   increasing the amount of the loan to   $112.0 million   but keeping the orginal 2019 maturity. The interest rate on the new loan is   LIBOR   plus   2.35%   per annum and has no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. The additional funds were used to repay a development loan and associated accrued interest.

     Table of Contents  

Including debt of consolidated variable entities, approximately   27%   of the outstanding principal amount of Belmond s consolidated debt is in euros and the balance primarily in U.S. dollars. At   September 30, 2016  ,   52%   of borrowings of Belmond were at floating interest rates. 
    
  Belmond has contingently guaranteed debt obligations of certain of its joint ventures. The following table summarizes these commitments at   September 30, 2016  : 

Belmond has guaranteed the Peru rail joint venture s contingent obligations relating to the performance of its governmental rail concessions   through May 2017  . In addition, Belmond has contingently guaranteed   $18.2 million   of the debt obligations maturing in 2020 of the Peru hotels joint venture that operates four hotels. The contingent guarantees for each Peruvian joint venture may only be enforced in the event there is a change in control of the relevant joint venture, which would occur only if Belmond s ownership of the economic and voting interests in the joint venture falls below 50%, an event which has not occurred and is not expected to occur. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Belmond had adopted all relevant accounting guidance, as reported in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounting pronouncements to be adopted are also reported in Note 1. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  For a discussion of these, see Item 7   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Belmond is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  These exposures are monitored and managed as part of its overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to mitigate material adverse effects on consolidated earnings and cash flow. Belmond does not hold market rate sensitive financial instruments for trading purposes.  
    
  The market risk relating to interest rates arises mainly from the financing activities of Belmond. Earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on floating rate borrowings, principally based on U.S. dollar LIBOR and EURIBOR. Belmond management assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis. If the rate (including margin) paid by Belmond increased by 10% with all other variables held constant and after taking into account the 1% floor on the corporate term loan, annual net finance costs of Belmond would have increased by approximately $0.6 million based on borrowings outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The market risk relating to foreign currencies arises from holding assets, buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, Great British pound, South African rand, Russian ruble and Brazilian real. Some non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company borrow in local currencies, and Belmond may in the future enter into forward exchange contracts relating to purchases denominated in foreign currencies. 
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

Ten of Belmond s owned hotels in   2016   operated in European euro territories, two in Brazilian real, one in South African rand, one in Great British pounds, three in Botswana pula, two in Mexican peso, one in Peruvian nuevo sol, one in Russian ruble and six in various Southeast Asian currencies. Revenue of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, Belmond British Pullman, Belmond Northern Belle and Belmond Royal Scotsman trains was primarily in Great British pounds, but the operating costs of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express were mainly denominated in euros. Revenue derived by Belmond Maroma Resort and Spa, Belmond La Samanna and Belmond Miraflores Park was recorded in U.S. dollars, but the majority of the hotels  expenses were denominated in Mexican pesos, European euros and Peruvian nuevo soles, respectively. Both revenue and the majority of expenses for Belmond Governor's Residence and Belmond La R sidence D'Angkor were recorded in U.S. dollars. 
    
  The currency of revenue and costs at Belmond's properties are generally the same. Belmond hedges the U.S. dollar value of its euro denominated net assets by drawing part of its debt in euros and designating that debt as a net investment hedge. In addition, a significant proportion of the guests at Belmond hotels located outside of the United States originate from the United States. When a foreign currency in which Belmond operates depreciates against the U.S. dollar, Belmond has some flexibility to increase prices in local currency, or vice versa. Management believes that when these factors are combined, Belmond does not face a material exposure to its net earnings from currency movements, although the reporting of Belmond s revenue and costs translated into U.S. dollars can, from period to period, be materially affected. 
    
  Belmond management uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact on net earnings of changes in foreign currency financial instruments from hypothetical changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. The primary assumption used in this model is a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening of the foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. However, because Belmond does not have at   September 30, 2016   any significant financial instruments in a currency other than the functional currency of the operation concerned, apart from the euro-denominated indebtedness designated as a net investment hedge discussed in Note 19, there is no material potential impact on net earnings at   September 30, 2016   as a result of hypothetical changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. 

ITEM 4.        Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of Belmond s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Belmond management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to provide reasonable assurance that the information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate time periods.  Based on that evaluation, Belmond management has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in Belmond s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Belmond s internal control over financial reporting.
