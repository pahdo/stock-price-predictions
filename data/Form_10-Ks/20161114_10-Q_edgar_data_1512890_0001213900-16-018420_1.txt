1.  
      ORGANIZATION
    AND OPERATIONS   

Excel
Corporation (the  Company ) was organized on November 13, 2010 as a Delaware corporation. The Company has three wholly
owned subsidiaries, Excel Business Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a eVance Capital), Payprotec Oregon, LLC (d/b/a Securus Payments),
( Securus ), and eVance Processing Inc. ( eVance ).  

On February 17, 2014, the Company entered
into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the  SEA ) with Securus, Mychol Robirds and Steven Lemma, to purchase 90% of
the membership interests of Securus and its subsidiary Securus Consultants, LLC. On April 21, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition
of 100% of Securus pursuant to the SEA and through a Securities Exchange Agreement ( E-Cig Agreement) with E-Cig Ventures
LLC. 

Prior
to the acquisition of Securus in April of 2014, we were considered a developmental stage company as defined by FASB ASC 915-205-45-6.
With the acquisition of Securus, we ceased to be a development stage company.  

On
November 30, 2015, eVance entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Calpian, Inc. ( Calpian ),
Calpian Residual Acquisition, LLC ( CRA ) and Calpian Commerce, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Calpian ( CCI, 
and collectively with Calpian and CRA, the  Sellers ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, eVance acquired substantially
all of the U.S. assets and operations of the Sellers. In consideration for the acquired assets, eVance assumed certain of the
Sellers  liabilities, including an aggregate of $9,000,000 of notes payable and certain of the Sellers  outstanding
contractual obligations.   

On April 12, 2016, eVance entered into
an agreement with the Sellers and a cancellation of securities acknowledgement with one of eVance s note-holders whereby
the noteholder cancelled its note in the amount of $720,084 and Calpian issued eVance a note in the amount of $675,000 in exchange
for eVance and the Sellers mutually waiving any claims either party has or could have under the Purchase Agreement against the
other. The $675,000 note bears simple interest of 12% per annum payable monthly and matures on November 30, 2017. As part of the
Purchase Agreement, eVance acquired several residual portfolios including the supporting contracts (residual purchase agreements).
eVance, as successor under one of these residual purchase agreements, has sued a third party for breach of contract on the residual
purchase agreement between the third party and Seller and claimed damages in excess of $1,500,000. eVance has agreed to apply any
recovery from such litigation (less costs) against the principal balance of the $675,000 note up to a maximum of $675,000. The
Company reflected the reduction in the assumed debt by $720,084 as a reduction in goodwill and a reduction in the debt assumed.
In addition, the noteholder returned a warrant to purchase 360,042 shares of the Company s common stock. As a result of this
agreement, the $9,000,000 of notes payable was reduced to $8,279,916. 

On April 30, 2016, Securus entered into
a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  2016 Purchase Agreement ) with Chyp LLC ( Chyp ). In connection with
the 2016 Purchase Agreement, Chyp executed a three-year preferred marketing agreement with eVance. Chyp acquired substantially
all of the operations of Securus including its sales and marketing operations located in Portland Oregon and West Palm Beach Florida.
Securus retained the approximately 5,000 merchants and related merchant processing residual portfolios.

      SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation  

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01
of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these unaudited
consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for
a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Reclassification  

Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation.

3.  
      FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

Fair
value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date. ASC Topic No. 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as described below:  

Level
1: Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets, quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active, and observable
inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates.  

Level
3: Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs.  

The
following required disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the Company using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data
to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may
have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.  

The
methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instruments are as follows:  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Accrued Compensation, Other Accrued Liabilities, and Income Taxes
Payable.  

The
items are generally short-term in nature, and accordingly, the carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets are
reasonable approximations of their fair values.  

Note
Receivable, Other Long Term Assets, Notes Payable, and Other Long Term Liabilities.  

The
carrying amounts approximate the fair value as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.

      RECENT
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ( ASU 2014-09 ) which outlines
a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes
most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Revenue recorded under ASU 2014-09 will depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2018 and early adoption is not permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material
impact on the Company s financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . ASU 2015-17 eliminates
the requirement to bifurcate deferred taxes between current and noncurrent on the balance sheet and requires that deferred tax
assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 may be applied retrospectively or prospectively
and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this standard will have a material impact on its financial
position.  

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
of leases for both parties to a contract. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either
finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases
with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted
for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an
approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
ASU 2016-02 supersedes the previous leases standard, Leases (Topic 840). The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

      RECENT
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (Continued)   

On August 26, 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic
230) .  This ASU is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within
the statement of cash flows. The ASU s amendments add or clarify guidance on eight cash flow issues: 

Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs.  

Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation
to the effective interest rate of the borrowing.  

Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination.  

Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims.  

Proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies.  

Distributions received from equity method investees.  

Beneficial interests in securitization transactions.  

Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  

The guidance in the ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this standard on
its consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting
standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a
future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  

5.  
      DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS   

On April 30, 2016, Securus entered into the
2016 Purchase Agreement with Chyp. In connection with the 2016 Purchase Agreement, Chyp executed a three year preferred marketing
agreement with eVance. 

Pursuant to the 2016 Purchase Agreement,
Chyp acquired substantially all of the operations of Securus including its sales and marketing operations located in Portland Oregon
and West Palm Beach Florida. Securus retained its approximately 5,000 merchants and related merchant processing residual portfolio.
Securus also retained substantially all of its liabilities, including but not limited to, its note payable with Blue Acre Ventures
(BAV), trade payables as well as liabilities to merchants. 

Pursuant to the 2016 Purchase Agreement,
Securus will provide financial assistance to Chyp in the form of a forgivable loan to support the transition of Securus 
operations to Chyp. Securus advances Chyp $75,000 per month for six months and $50,000 in the seventh and eighth months for a total
of $550,000. Accordingly, Chyp executed a $550,000 promissory note (the  Chyp Note ) in favor of Securus. The Chyp
Note bears an interest rate of 12% per annum with both the principal and interest due on May 1, 2017. If Chyp is in material compliance
with the 2016 Purchase Agreement and related agreements through May 1, 2017, Securus will forgive the Chyp Note. Securus will also
reimburse Chyp for commissions payable to Chyp employees and agents on Securus  residual portfolio as if those agents and
employees were still employed by Securus. Chyp is owned by Steven Lemma and Mychol Robirds, who are former executives of Securus. 

We
accounted for the sale of the Securus operations to Chyp in accordance with ASC 205-20-45-1 and have classified the assets and
operations sold to Chyp as discontinued operations. The Company recorded a loss on disposal of $840,641 related to the transaction.
The charge includes a $290,641 write-off of the net assets acquired by Chyp and $550,000 for the financial assistance to be provided
to Chyp during 2016.  

A
summary of results of discontinued operations is as follows:

      INCOME
    TAXES   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-10 which requires the Company
to provide a net deferred tax asset/liability equal to the expected future tax benefit/expense of temporary reporting differences
between book and tax accounting methods and any available operating loss or tax credit carryforwards. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company had available unused operating loss carryforwards of $3,667,302 and $1,931,243, respectively, which
generated a deferred tax benefits of $1,356,902 and $714,560, respectively. The Company had a 100% valuation allowance on the
deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016.   

The
Company s provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consists of the following:  

The
Company accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740  Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes . The Company has determined that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in
its financial statements.  

In
the event the Company is assessed for interest and/or penalties by taxing authorities, such assessed amounts will be classified
in the financial statements as income tax expense. Tax years 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination by Federal and state
taxing authorities.   

7.  
      STOCKHOLDERS 
    EQUITY   

On April 21, 2014, the Company issued two
shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the two previous members of Securus. As long as a former member held at least 9,000,000
shares of the Company s common stock, then the member had the right to exchange his share of preferred stock for a 24.5%
share of the membership interests of Securus upon a change of control in Securus (as defined). In connection with the 2016
Purchase Agreement on April 30, 2016, the Company acquired the two shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

On
November 30, 2015, in connection with its acquisition of the U.S. assets and operations of Calpian Inc., the Company issued warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 5,452,458 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.05 per share, subject
to adjustments. The warrants expire on November 30, 2025.  

We
estimate the fair value of warrants and stock options when issued or vested using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and
subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized. Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions.
We determined, using the Black-Scholes options pricing model, that these warrants have no current value, based on a maturity date
of five years, a risk-free interest rate of 2.230%, and a calculated volatility rate of 8.530%, using historical stock prices
of the Company.  

On
September 1, 2015, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of its Common Stock to an executive in connection with the executive s
employment and the use of certain trade names and brands owned by the executive. 500,000 shares vested upon grant and an additional
500,000 shares were scheduled to vest on September 1, 2016, September 1, 2017, and September 1, 2018. The Company terminated the
executive s employment in January 2016, and the shares subject to vesting (1,500,000) were forfeited. The executive is currently
disputing the forfeiture of these shares.  

On
March 18, 2016, the Company issued 2,300,000 Shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series B Shares ) to
each of Thomas A. Hyde Jr. and Robert L. Winspear (each a  Holder  and collectively the  Holders ) at
a price of $0.05 per share pursuant to subscription agreements between the Company and the Holders. Mr. Hyde is the President,
Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company. Mr. Winspear is the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

      STOCKHOLDERS 
    EQUITY (Continued)   

The Series B Shares are convertible into
shares of the Company s common stock par value $0.0001 ( Common Stock ) on a ratio of 1-to-1, subject to adjustment
for stock splits and stock dividends. The Series B Shares rank senior to the Common Stock and other preferred shares and carry
a liquidation preference of $.05 per share. Holders of the Series B Shares are entitled to receive dividends declared on the Company s
Common Stock on an as converted basis. Each Series B Share entitles the Holder thereof to 20 votes per share on all matters subject
to voting by holders of the Company s Common Stock. The issuance of 4,600,000 shares of Series B Shares, entitles the Holders
thereof to 92,000,000 votes. Under the terms of the Series B Shares, the Company has the right to require a Holder to convert
the Series B Shares into Common Stock at any time after the Holder resigns, is terminated or otherwise ceases to be an officer
of the Company. In addition, the Company has the right at any time after July 18, 2016 to repurchase and retire all but not less
than all of the Series B Preferred Stock for $0.05 per share provided that it gives notice to the Holder of the Company s
intent to redeem the shares and the Holder does not elect to convert the Series B Shares into Common Stock in lieu of the redemption. 

In
connection with the issuance of the Series B Shares, the Company and the Holders executed a Stockholders Agreement (the  Agreement )
whereby the Holders agreed to not to initiate directly or indirectly any stockholder vote or action, by written consent or otherwise,
to increase the size or structure of the Company s board of directors or remove any existing director, nor initiate directly
or indirectly any stockholder vote or action by written consent or otherwise, to affect Holders  executive compensation,
bonus criteria and amounts, or other similar action. The Holders also agreed to convert the Series B Shares immediately upon termination,
whether voluntary or involuntary, or upon their resignation for any reason.  

On August 12, 2016, the Company granted 1,000,000
shares of its common stock to an employee. 333,333 of these shares vested immediately, 333,333 vest on December 1, 2016 and 333,334
vest on December 1, 2017. The Company recorded compensation expense of $26,944 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
On August 12, 2016, the Company also issued a warrant to purchase 500,000 of its common stock to a consultant. The warrant has
an exercise price of $0.06 per share and a term of 18 months.

    PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

On February 15, 2016, SME Funding LLC purchased
$35,000 of the Company s monthly residuals for $700,000 cash, pursuant to a residual purchase agreement ( RPA ).
Under the terms of the RPA, the Company was obliged to maintain the residual at $35,000 for a period of 20 months. In addition,
the Company had the right to repurchase the residuals for $770,000 prior to October 17, 2017. As a result of the repurchase option,
the Company accounted for the transaction as a liability and not as a sale. The $700,000 is included in other long-term liabilities
on the accompanying balance sheet. The Company exercised this right and repurchased the residuals for $770,000 on November 3,
2016. See Note 14. 

On November 2, 2016, the Company and
certain of the Company s subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with
GACP Finance Co. LLC as administrative agent ( Agent ) and the other lenders as from time to time party thereto. The
Loan Agreement has a three-year term and provides for term loan commitments of up to $25,000,000 consisting of an Initial Term
Loan in the amount of $13,500,000 and a Delayed Draw Term Loan in the amount of $11,500,000 (each a  Loan  or together
 Loans ). 

The Loans accrue interest of 18% per
annum of which 13% is payable in cash monthly and 5% is payable in kind (PIK). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Loans are secured
by substantially all of the assets of the Company including but not limited to the Company s residual portfolios. In addition,
certain of Excel s subsidiaries are guarantors under the Loan Agreement. 

The Loan Agreement contains customary
events of default, including but not limited to non-payment of principal or other amounts under the Loan Agreement, breach of covenants,
certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events. The Loan agreement also contains certain financial covenants including maintenance
of certain EBITDA levels and minimum liquidity (as defined). If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the Agent declare
all amounts owed to be due (except for a bankruptcy event of default), in which case such amounts will automatically become due
and payable. 

The Company used the proceeds
from the loan to repay all of its existing secured debt of which $8,881,482 was outstanding on September 30, 2016 (See
Note 12). In addition, the Company exercised its repurchase rights under RPA and paid SME Funding LLC $770,000 to repurchase
a $35,000 monthly residual (see Note 13). 

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 should be read in conjunction with our interim financial statements and the notes to those financial statements
that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon
current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results
and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number
of factors, including those set forth under the  Risk Factors,   Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements  and  Description of Business  sections and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. We use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plan,   project, 
 continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe,   intend,   may, 
 will,   should,   could,   predict,  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking
statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions
within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements.
We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason even if new information becomes available
or other events occur in the future . 

Current
Overview    

We
sell integrated financial and transaction processing services to small and medium sized businesses throughout the United States.
We provide these services through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Securus and eVance. Securus operates as a national retail ISO
and MSP with approximately 5,000 merchants across the country using First Data Corporation as its primary processing partner.
eVance utilizes multiple processing partners including TSYS, Cynergy, Elavon, First Data Corporation and others. These relationships
allow us to provide rapid clearing of payments, using traditional credit card terminals, POS systems and mobile applications,
including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay. Our merchant account solutions, combined with the latest mobile site and cloud
based technologies, are designed to meet the unique needs of our over 10,000 merchant customers across the U.S.  

Through
our eVance subsidiary, we provide an integrated suite of third-party merchant payment processing services and related proprietary
software enabling products that deliver credit and debit card-based internet payments processing solutions to small and mid-sized
merchants operating in physical  brick and mortar  business environments, on the internet and in retail settings requiring
both wired and wireless mobile payment solutions. We operate as a wholesale ISO generating individual merchant processing contracts
in exchange for future residual payments. As a wholesale ISO, eVance takes greater responsibility in the approval and monitoring
of merchants than do retail ISOs and we receive additional consideration for this service and risk. eVance also intends to acquire
merchant debit and credit processing residual revenue streams paid by transaction processors to ISOs. eVance  s U.S. merchant
residual portfolios, comprise over 5,000 traditional retail and e-commerce merchant accounts, and several residual revenue portfolios.  

On April 30, 2016, Securus
entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  2016 Purchase Agreement ) with Chyp LLC ( Chyp ). In
connection with the Purchase Agreement, Chyp executed a three-year preferred marketing agreement with eVance. 

Chyp
acquired substantially all of the operations of Securus including its sales and marketing operations located in Portland Oregon
and West Palm Beach Florida. Securus retained its approximately 5,000 merchants and the related merchant processing residual portfolios.
Securus also retained substantially all of its liabilities, including but not limited to, its note payable with Blue Acre Ventures,
trade payables as well as liabilities to merchants. 

During
2015, we began selling merchant cash advances through our Excel Business Solutions Inc. subsidiary, marketed as  eVance
Capital  and  Securus Cash and Capital.  We sell alternative financing and working capital solutions to small
and medium sized businesses utilizing a variety of third-party funding sources. We do not provide capital directly or take credit
risk. We earn commissions from third-party capital funders by placing their financial products with our merchant customers. This
portion of our business does not yet represent a significant portion of our revenues, costs, or assets.  

We
are actively seeking acquisition opportunities in related industries including, but not limited to, merchant services and merchant
cash advance companies. Although management believes that there are acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to complete any such transactions.  

Use
of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Results
of Operations    

On November 30,
2015, eVance acquired substantially all of the US operations of Calpian Inc. As a result of this acquisition, operating results
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not comparable. The substantial increases in revenues and operating
costs and expenses are due to the acquisition of Calpian s US assets by eVance. 

Revenues    

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of $4,265,362 compared to revenues of $1,081,847 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had revenues of $12,731,311 as compared to revenues of $3,295,781 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenues from Securus increased by $218,758 and $226,373 for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 respectively as compared to the prior year. 

Costs
and Expenses    

Our operating costs
and expenses were $3,599,683 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $634,604 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Processing and servicing costs were $2,467,680 or 57.9% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and $6,637,479 or 52.1% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Corporate overhead accounted for $623,699
and $1,910,993 of total costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to
$448,624 and $1,501,869 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in corporate overhead was primarily
due to higher compensation. 

Interest
expense    

Interest expense
net of interest income was $310,763 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $66,773 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net interest expense was $917,418
and $213,373, respectively. The increase was due primarily to the $8,029,916 of debt assumed by eVance s purchase of
Calpian s US assets. 

Net
income from continuing operations    

Net income from continuing
operations was $354,916 and $380,470 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, higher operating income from Securus was offset by higher corporate overhead and interest expense as
compared to the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $1,238,301 and $1,108,113 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the prior year period was due to both higher processing revenues by Securus and the additional income generated by the acquisition
of eVance in November of 2015.  

Loss on discontinued
operations includes the results of the Securus operations sold to Chyp LLC on April 30, 2016. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

The
following summarizes our cash flows:   

Net cash used in
operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $152,015 as compared with net cash provided by operating
activities $523,226 in 2015. Net losses from discontinued operations were partially offset by improvement in continuing operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Net cash used in
investing activities was $25,422 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $163,656 used in investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The higher capital expenditures in 2015 were primarily for computer software. 

Net cash used in
financing activities was $99,795 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $464,193 used in financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The improvement was due to the issuance of the Class B Convertible Preferred
Stock and lower debt service payments. 

As of September
30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $84,898, total current assets of $1,253,032 and total current liabilities of $12,639,000. 

On November 2, 2016, the
Company and certain of the Company s subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement )
with GACP Finance Co. LLC as administrative agent ( Agent ) and the other lenders as from time to time party thereto.
The Loan Agreement has a three-year term and provides for term loan commitments of up to $25,000,000 consisting of an Initial
Term Loan in the amount of $13,500,000 and a Delayed Draw Term Loan in the amount of $11,500,000 ( Loan  or together
 Loans ). The Loans accrue interest of 18% per annum of which 13% is payable in cash monthly and 5% is payable in
kind (PIK). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Loans are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company including
but not limited to the Company s residual portfolios. In addition, certain of Excel s subsidiaries are guarantors
under the Loan Agreement. 

The Loan Agreement
contains customary events of default, including but not limited to non-payment of principal or other amounts under the Loan Agreement,
breach of covenants and certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events. The Loan Agreement also contains certain financial
covenants including maintenance of certain EBITDA levels and minimum liquidity. If any event of default occurs and is continuing,
the Agent declare all amounts owed to be due (except for a bankruptcy event of default), in which case such amounts will automatically
become due and payable. 

The Company believes
that the additional working capital provided by the Loan as well as future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet
the Company s operating expenses and obligations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.  

Significant
Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Company, and include the accounts of the Company and
subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions in the consolidation.  

Revenue
Recognition  

The
Company receives a percentage of recurring monthly transaction related fees comprised of credit and debit card fees charged to
merchants, net of association fees, otherwise known as Interchange, as well as certain service charges and convenience fees, for
payment processing services, including authorization, capture, clearing, settlement and information reporting of electronic transactions.
Fees are calculated on either a percentage of the dollar volume of the transaction or a fixed fee or a hybrid of the two and are
recognized at the time of the transaction. In the case of  wholesale  residual revenue in which the Company bears
risk of chargebacks and performs underwriting on the merchants, the Company records the full discount charged to the merchant
as revenue and the related interchange and other processing fees as expenses. In cases of residual revenue where the Company is
not responsible for merchant underwriting and has no chargeback liability, the Company records the amount it receives from the
processor net of interchange and other processing fees as revenue.   

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  

The
Company considers all cash accounts, which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of financial instruments
included in cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturities for the instruments held. Restricted
cash is not included as cash and cash equivalents.  

Income
Taxes  

Income
taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently
due plus deferred taxes related primarily to tax net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent
the future tax return consequences of these differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when assets and liabilities
are recovered or settled, as well as operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management,
it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available. Because the judgment about the level of future
taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may, at least in part, be beyond the Company s control, it
is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could
change in the near term.  

Earnings
Per Share  

Basic earnings per share
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available for common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Fully diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share as the Company had no material common
stock equivalents outstanding during the periods presented. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
does not currently believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have
a material effect on the Company s financial statements.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.  

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 and found them to be effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

4.
The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures

(a)
Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

(b)
Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed

financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

(c)
Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions

Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the

has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial
reporting; and   

5.
The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons
performing the equivalent functions):   

(a)
All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and  

(b)
Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting.
