              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.        6            TRIMAX CONSULTING, INC.         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015     (UNAUDITED)         Note 1.     Organization, History and Business        Trimax Consulting, Inc. ( the Company ) was incorporated in Nevada on May 19, 2014. The Company was established for the purpose of real estate consulting and the purchasing of Tax Liens         Note 2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies          Revenue Recognition        Revenue is derived from sales of products to distributors and consumers. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,  as revised by SAB No. 104. As such, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred, the price is fixed or readily determinable, and collectability is probable. Sales are recorded net of sales discounts and terms are recorded by contract.        Accounts Receivable        Accounts receivable is reported at the customers  outstanding balances, less any allowance for doubtful accounts.  Interest is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable.        Allowance for Doubtful Accounts        An allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate to cover any probable losses.  Management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages and information collected from individual customers.  Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired.        Stock Based Compensation        When applicable, the Company will account for stock-based payments to employees in accordance with ASC 718,  Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ).  Stock-based payments to employees include grants of stock, grants of stock options and issuance of warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant.            7           The Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.   Stock-based payments to non-employees include grants of stock, grants of stock options and issuances of warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the value of the vested portion of the award over the requisite service period as measured at its then-current fair value as of each financial reporting date.       The Company calculates the fair value of option grants and warrant issuances utilizing the Binomial pricing model.  The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.  ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time stock options are granted and warrants are issued to employees and non-employees, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  The term  forfeitures  is distinct from  cancellations  or  expirations  and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock option or warrant.  The Company estimates forfeiture rates for all unvested awards when calculating the expense for the period.  In estimating the forfeiture rate, the Company monitors both stock option and warrant exercises as well as employee termination patterns.  The resulting stock-based compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which the Company expects to receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting period.        Loss per Share        The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260-10, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings (loss) per share has not been presented since there are no dilutive securities.        Cash and Cash Equivalents        For purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include all stable, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less.        Concentration of Credit Risk        The Company primarily transacts its business with one financial institution. The amount on deposit in that one institution may from time to time exceed the federally-insured limit.             8            Use of Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.        Business segments         ASC 280,  Segment Reporting  requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company determined it has one operating segment as of September 30, 2016.       Investment in Real Property Tax Liens   The investments in real property tax liens are accounted for as investments in troubled debt and are carried at cost. Collection of interest, penalties and expense reimbursements is not certain and is recognized upon being realized. The Company has evaluated the collectability of the tax liens and believes the investments are realizable over time as the first position liens are secured by the related real property and the estimated fair value of the real property is in excess of the carrying value of the tax liens and the estimated cost to foreclose and sell the real property. Therefore no impairment was recognized on the tax liens as of September 30, 2016.        Income Taxes        The Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  The method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 is an asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of other assets and liabilities.        Emerging growth Company        We are an  emerging growth company  as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ) and, as such, may elect to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for future filings.            9            Recent Accounting Pronouncements        On June 10, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915)   Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) in its entirety from current accounting guidance. The Company has elected early adoption of this new standard.       The Company has implemented all other new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.        Note 3.   Income Taxes        Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.       The effective tax rate on the net loss before income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate as follows:                  10           The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:             On an interim basis, the Company had no net operating losses and has $19,054 available to offset future income for income tax reporting purposes, which will expire in various years through 2032, if not previously utilized. However, the Company s ability to use the carryover net operating loss may be substantially limited or eliminated pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382.The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, and  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . The Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016.       The Company s policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax purposes. During the period May 19, 2014(inception) through September 30, 2016, there were no income tax, or related interest and penalty items in the income statement, or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Nevada state jurisdiction.  We are not currently involved in any income tax examinations.        Note 4.   Related Party Transactions        Oeshadebie Waterford has lent the company a net total of $550 to the company for the period from May 19, 2014(inception) to September 30, 2016. These funds have been used for working capital to date.        Note 5.   Stockholders  Equity         Common Stock        The holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to one vote per share of common stock held. The Company recorded a 5 for 1 forward split on May 18, 2015. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this transaction. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had 25,957,500 shares issued and outstanding.            11            Note 6.    Commitments and Contingencies          Commitments:         The Company currently has no long term commitments as of our balance sheet date.        Contingencies:         None as of our balance sheet date.        Note 7.   Net Income (Loss) Per Share        The following table sets forth the information used to compute basic and diluted net income per share attributable to the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:     
           Note 8.   Notes Payable      
               12            Note 9.   Going Concern        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. Currently, the Company has no operating history and has limited working capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the Company s development efforts and its efforts to raise capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for working capital purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be available in the future.   The conditions described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.        Note 10.   Investments          Investment in Available for Sale Debt Securities                 Investment in Real Property Tax Liens     At September 30, 2016, the Company held $1,231 of real property tax liens from various municipalities in the Parrish of Caddo, Louisiana. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased $1,231 of tax lien products. The Louisiana municipal tax liens are receivable from the real property owners and are secured by a first priority lien on the related real property. Upon foreclosure, the Company would obtain ownership of the real property. The tax lien receivables accrue interest up to 1% per month, and accrue penalties at 5%.. The investment in the real property tax liens are accounted for as an investment in troubled debts and are carried at cost. Collection of interest and penalties is not certain and is recognized upon being realized.          Note 11.   Subsequent Events        There are no subsequent events.            13           Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Forward-Looking Statements    This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include those concerning the following:  Our intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding the fair value of all assets and liabilities recorded; our strategies; growth opportunities; product development and introduction relating to new and existing products; the enterprise market and related opportunities; competition and competitive advantages and disadvantages; industry standards and compatibility of our products; relationships with our employees; our facilities, operating lease and our ability to secure additional space; cash dividends; excess inventory, our expenses; interest and other income; our beliefs and expectations about our future success and results; our operating results; our belief that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements, our expectations regarding our revenues and customers; investments and interest rates.  These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially.       The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.        Critical Accounting Policies    The financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in this report has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with certain amounts based on management s best estimates and judgments. To determine appropriate carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, management uses assumptions based on historical results and other factors they believe are reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Our critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016.        Trends and Uncertainties    Demand for the registrant's products are dependent on general economic conditions, which are cyclical in nature. Because a major portion of our activities are the receipt of revenues from our services and products, our business operations may be adversely affected by competitors and prolonged recessionary periods.       There are no other known trends, events or uncertainties that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity. Sources of liquidity will come from the sale of our products and services. There are no material         14           commitments for capital expenditure at this time. There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from the registrant s continuing operations. There are no other known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of our financial statements.       We currently have operations planned through December 31, 2016.        Capital and Sources of Liquidity        We have $41 in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.  We believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be insufficient to conduct operations through December 31, 2016.  We are currently seeking financing solutions to generate the capitol necessary to continue our operations.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $16,629.  We recorded a decrease in accrued expenses of $2,500, resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $19,129.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net income of $6,377.  We recorded a decrease in deferred revenue of $1,000 and a decrease in accrued expenses of $500.  We recorded an increase in tax liens of $1,231.  As a result, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $4,646 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we spent $2,070 on the investment in land, resulting in net cash used by investing activities of $2,070 for the period.  We did not pursue any investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we spent $500 on the repayment of related party loans and received $550 as proceeds from related party loans, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $50 for the period.         For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received $19,150 from the issuance of common stock and paid $4,000 for repayments to related party loans.  As a result, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $15,150 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.        Results of Operations        For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not record any revenues.  We had operating expenses of $1,388, resulting in a net loss of $1,388 for the period.            15           Comparatively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded revenues of $2,000.  We paid operating expenses of $1,000, resulting in a net income of $1,000 for the period.       The $2,388 decrease between the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the net gain for September 30, 2015 is a direct result of recording no revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded revenues of $339.  We paid operating expenses of $16,968, resulting in a net loss of $16,629 for the period.       Comparatively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded revenues of $11,000.  We paid operating expenses of $4,623, resulting in a net income of $6,377 for the period.       The $23,006 decrease between the net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the net gain for September 30, 2015 is a direct result of the extra expenses that are incurred in starting a business, combined with the reduced revenue that comes as part of being a start-up business.  We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations.  Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resource and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in products.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       The registrant had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016.       Contractual Obligations       The registrant has no material contractual obligations       Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Not applicable for a smaller reporting company.            16           Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.       Controls and Procedures.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to insure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or the persons performing similar functions, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.       Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, or the persons performing similar functions, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO, or the persons performing similar functions, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.        Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:        Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, or those persons performing similar functions, our management has evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2016.  Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO, or those persons performing similar functions, did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        Important Considerations:        The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.        17            PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1.

I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Trimax Consulting, Inc.;                2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;                3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;                4. I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:             a.  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures, to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;             b.  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;             c.  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and             d.

I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):                a.  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and                b.  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
