Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued   

Use
of estimates    

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Significant
Estimates    

These
financial statements include some amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments. The most significant
estimates relate to depreciation of property, plant and equipment, the valuation allowance for deferred taxes. It is reasonably
possible that the above-mentioned estimates and others may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any
adjustment could be significant in future reporting periods.  

Variable
Interest Entity

August 22, 2011 with Xili Wang as the  CC Power Shareholder  and with CC Power pursuant to which CC Investment provides

substantially all of the assets, or all or a part of the equity of CC Power, in each case for nominal consideration, plus the
cancellation of all or part of the debt owing under the Loan Agreement described below. CC Investment may exercise its purchase
option at any time.

Equity
Pledge Agreement.  Pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreement among CC Power, CC Investment, and the CC Power Shareholder, the
CC Power Shareholder agreed to pledge all of his equity interest in CC Power to CC Investment as a guaranty of the performance
of the obligations of the CC Power Shareholder and CC Power under the Loan Agreement, the Entrusted Management Service Agreement,
the Technical Services Agreement, and the Exclusive Purchase Option Agreement. The Equity Pledge Agreement will remain in effect
until all payments due and obligations under the foregoing agreements have been fulfilled by the CC Power Shareholder and/or CC
Power. Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Pledge Agreement, the CC Power Shareholder shall not, among other things, sell, transfer,
mortgage or otherwise dispose of or encumber the pledged equity interests without CC Investment s prior written consent.  

Assignment
and Novation Agreement   

In
addition to revising the controlling agreements, CC Power, CC Investment, Xili Wang and Mr. Wei entered into an Assignment and
Novation Agreement, under which the parties acknowledged that the new CC Power controlling agreements have replaced the original
controlling agreements in their entirety, meaning that as of August 25, 2016, Xili Wang assigned to Mr. Wei all of the rights
of the CC Power Shareholder under the CC Power controlling agreements, and Mr. Wei assumed from Xili Wang all of the obligations
of the CC Power Shareholder under such agreements. The Assignment and Novation Agreement provides that the original controlling
agreements have been terminated and replaced in their entirety by the updated controlling agreements. With respect to the Loan
Agreement, the Assignment and Novation Agreement provides that the amount originally borrowed by Xili Wang under the original
loan agreement, which was contributed to the bank account of CC Power, shall be treated as the amount received by Mr. Wei under
the Loan Agreement, and that Mr. Wei shall assume the responsibility to repay the loan and fulfill all the obligations of the
borrower under the Loan Agreement.  

In
sum, the agreements transfer to CC Investment all of the benefits and all of the risk arising from the operations of CC Power,
as well as complete managerial authority over the operations of CC Power. Through these contractual arrangements, the Company
has the ability to substantially influence CC Power s daily operations and financial affairs, appoint its directors and
senior executives, and approve all matters requiring board and/or shareholder approval. These contractual arrangements enable
the Company to control CC Power and operate our business in the PRC through CC Investment. By reason of the relationship described
in these agreements, CC Power is a variable interest entity with respect to CC Investment and CC Investment is considered the
primary beneficiary of CC Power because the following characteristics identified in ASC 810-10-15-14 are present:  

-     
      The
    holder of the equity investment in CC Power lacks the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s
    activities that have a significant effect on the success of CC Power, having assigned their voting rights and all managerial
    authority to CC Investment. (ASC 810-10-15-14(b)(1)).   

-     
      The
    holder of the equity investment in CC Power lacks the obligation to absorb the expected losses of CC Power, having assigned
    to CC Investment all revenue and responsibility for all payables. (ASC 810-10-15-14(b)(2).   

-  
      The
    holder of the equity investment in CC Power lacks the right to receive the expected residual returns of CC Power, having granted
    to CC Investment all revenue as well as an option to purchase the equity interests at a fixed price. (ASC 810-10-15-14(b)(3)).   

Accordingly,
the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, assets and liabilities of CC
Power. The carrying amount and classification of CC Power s assets and liabilities included in the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets are as follows:

Jifu   

The
accounts of Jifu have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company because Jifu is a variable interest entity with respect
to CC Investment, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. CC Investment entered into five agreements dated May 7, 2013
with Jifu Shareholder and with Jifu pursuant to which CC Investment provides Jifu with exclusive technology consulting and management
services. In summary, the five agreements contain the following terms:  

Entrusted
Management Agreement. Effective on May 7, 2013, CC Investment entered into an Entrusted Management Agreement with Jifu and the
Jifu Shareholders, pursuant to which CC Investment agreed to provide, and Jifu agreed to accept, exclusive management services
provided by CC Investment. Such management services include but are not limited to financial management, business management,
marketing management, human resource management and internal control of Jifu. Jifu will pay a service fee to CC Investment on
a quarterly basis, which fee will be a percentage of Jifu s total operational income. The Entrusted Management Agreement
will remain in effect until the acquisition of all the assets or equity of Jifu by CC Investment.  

Technical
Services Agreement. Effective on May 7, 2013, CC Investment entered into a Technical Services Agreement with Jifu and the Jifu
Shareholders, pursuant to which CC Investment agreed to provide, and Jifu agreed to accept, exclusive technical services provided
by CC Investment. Such technical services include but are not limited to software services, computer systems services, data analysis,
training and other technical services. Jifu will pay a service fee to CC Investment on a quarterly basis, which fee shall be a
percentage of Jifu s total operational income. The Technical Service Agreement will remain in effect until the acquisition
of all the assets or equity of Jifu by CC Investment.  

Exclusive
Purchase Option Agreement. Effective on May 7, 2013, CC Investment entered into an Exclusive Purchase Option Agreement with Jifu
and the Jifu Shareholders, pursuant to which the Jifu Shareholders granted CC Investment an irrevocable and exclusive purchase
option to acquire all of Jifu s equity and/or assets at a nominal consideration. CC Investment may exercise the purchase
option at any time. Until CC Investment has exercised its purchase option, Jifu is required to conduct its business in accordance
with certain covenants as further described in the Exclusive Purchase Option Agreement.  

Loan
Agreement  

Effective
on May 7, 2013, CC Investment entered into a Loan Agreement with the Jifu Shareholders, pursuant to which CC Investment agreed
to lend RMB 3,000,000 to the Jifu Shareholders, to be used solely for the operations of Jifu. The loan is interest free, unless
the deemed value of the consideration for the equity purchase of Jifu or asset purchase of Jifu under the Exclusive Purchase Option
Agreement is higher than the principal amount of the loan, in which case the excess will be deemed to be interest on the loan.  

Equity
Pledge Agreement  

Effective
on May 7, 2013, CC Investment entered into an Equity Pledge Agreement with Jifu and the Jifu Shareholders, pursuant to which the
Jifu Shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in Jifu, including the proceeds thereof, to guarantee all of CC Investment s
rights and benefits under the Entrusted Management Agreement, the Technical Service Agreement, the Exclusive Purchase Option Agreement
and the Loan Agreement. Prior to termination of the Equity Pledge Agreement, the pledged equity interests cannot be transferred
without CC Investment s prior consent. The Jifu Shareholders covenant to CC Investment that among other things, they will
only appoint/elect candidates for the board of directors of Jifu and supervisor office of Jifu that were nominated by CC Investment.

On
October 1, 2014, we entered into a Settlement Agreement, Waiver and Mutual Release with Jifu. Pursuant to the Release, the parties
cancelled the Stock Purchase Agreement. We have completely transferred bac k the ownership of shares of Jifu to Jifu Shareholders
without any further disputation and mutual accountability. In exchange, we have agreed to deliver 1,000,000 newly issued shares
of our common stock to Jifu Shareholders.  

Revenue
recognition    

Our
source of revenues is from internet accelerator software, which includes new software license revenues and software plus hardware
and maintenance arrangements, and the source of revenue of Jifu is from developing and distributing optical transmitters and receivers,
electronic surveillance equipment, and other communications equipment; and trading of electronic products, network products, and
communications equipment. We also engage in software research and development, GPS system development and website development
projects along with maintenance arrangements.  

We
evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in FASB ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition and Staff Accounting
Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as revised by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition.

Revenue
Recognition for Software Products (Software Elements)    

New
software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to download our software products that aim at
improving the internet connection speed of the mobile phone, computers or servers. The basis for software license revenue recognition
is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. For software license
that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenues
when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products;
(3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable.
Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions
are subsequently met.  

Our
software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions, software license updates or product support contracts.  

Revenue
Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements - Software Products and Software Related Services(Software Arrangements)    

We
enter into arrangements with customers that purchase software related products that include one to three year product support
service and a short training session (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element
arrangements include the sale of our software products, and product support contracts whereby software license delivery is followed
by the subsequent delivery of the other elements. Our software license arrangements include acceptance provisions. We recognize
revenue upon the receipt of written customer acceptance. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software
license updates and product support contracts. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software
product upgrades during the term of the support period. Product support includes telephone access to technical support personnel
or on-site support. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we recognized revenue pursuant to ASC 985-605. Since
we are unable to determine the fair value of the selling price for the undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement,
which is the product support service and training, the entire arrangement consideration is deferred and is recognized ratably
over the term of the arrangement, typically one year to three years.  

Revenue
Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements - Arrangements with Software and Hardware Elements    

We
also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our software installed in the hardware products
we purchased from third parties and service offerings including purchased hardware , new software licenses, installation of the
software in the hardware and one to three years product support. We adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13,
 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  :  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements  . This guidance modifies the fair value
requirements of FASB ASC subtopic 605-25,  Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements  , by allowing the use of the
 best estimate of selling price  in addition to vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence for determining
the selling price of a deliverable for non-software arrangements. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining
the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (a) vendor-specific objective evidence, (b) third-party evidence, or (c)
estimated selling price. In addition, the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted. In such
arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group
of elements as a whole and to the hardware elements. We recognize the hardware element considerations upon delivery of the hardware.
The consideration allocated to the software group which includes the software element and the product support is recognized in
according to the software arrangements policy as described above.  

Revenue
Recognition for Lottery Revenue    

Commission
income is recognized when the lottery ticket is sold through its online system. Other service income is recognized when the service
is provided.  

Cost
of Revenue    

Cost
of revenue primarily consists of direct costs of products, direct labor of technical staff, depreciation of computer equipment,
and overhead associated with the technical department.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued   

Economic
and political risks    

The
Company s operations are mainly conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and
results of operations in the PRC may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general
state of the PRC.  

The
Company s major operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated
with companies in North America. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment
and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions
in the PRC, and by changes in government administration, governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.  

Credit
risk    

The
Company may be exposed to credit risk from its cash and fixed deposits at bank. No allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable
amounts determined by reference to past default experience and the current economic environment.  

Property
and equipment    

Plant
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using
the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as follows:  

Equipment  
      5
    years   
 
      Office
    equipment  
      5
    years   
 
      Leasehold
    improvements  
      Over
    the lease terms   
 
      Software  
      5
    years   

The
cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or
loss is included in the statement of income. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred, whereas significant
renewals and betterments are capitalized.  

Accounting
for the impairment of long-lived assets    

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets is evaluated for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360-10  Impairments of Long-Lived Assets .
An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If
an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds its fair market value. The recoverability of long-lived assets is assessed by determining whether the unamortized
balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any,
is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company s average cost
of capital.

Inventories    

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Substantially all inventory costs are determined using the weighted average basis.
The management regularly evaluates the composition of its inventory to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories to determine
if additional write-downs are required.  

Accounts
receivable    

Accounts
receivable consists of amounts due from customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and determined based on management s
assessment of known requirements, aging of receivables, payment history, the customer s current credit worthiness and the
economic environment. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary
based on management s assessment.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

FASB
accounting standards require disclosing fair value to the extent practicable for financial instruments that are recognized or
unrecognized in the balance sheet. The fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not necessarily representative
of the amount that could be realized or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax consequences of realization or
settlement.  

For
certain financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accruals and other payables, the carrying amounts approximate
fair value because of the near term maturities of such obligations.  

Patents    

The
Company has three patents as listed in the table below relating to its internet accelerator software products. Fees related to
registering these patents were insignificant and have been expensed as incurred.  

Research
and development and Software Development Costs    

All
research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs eligible for capitalization under ASC 985-20,
 Software-Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed , were not material to our consolidated financial statements for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Research and development expenses amounted to $108,912 and $ 193,795 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were included in general and administrative expense.  

Comprehensive
income    

Comprehensive
income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding
transactions resulting from investments from owners and distributions to owners. For the Company, comprehensive income for the
periods presented includes net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.  

Income
taxes    

Income
taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Current tax is based
on the profit or loss from ordinary activities adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowable for income tax purpose
and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax
liabilities or assets are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and the financial reporting amounts at each year end. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some
portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

currency translation differences are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Shareholders 
Equity.  

The
exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into USD for the purposes of preparing the financial statements were as follows:

Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) has issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-01
 Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items . The objective is to
reduce the cost and complexity of income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items while maintaining
or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements. The extraordinary items must meet
two criteria: unusual nature and infrequency of occurrence. If an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification,
an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately
in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to disclose applicable
income taxes and either. This amendment will be effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods,
beginning after December 15, 2015. The Board decided to permit early adoption provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption.  

The
FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . The objective is to require
that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance
costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption of the amendments
in this update is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  

The
FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-05  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software . The objective is to provide
a guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes
a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition
of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account
for the arrangement as a service contract. The amendment will not change GAAP for a customer accounting for service contracts.
In addition, the guidance in this update supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16. Consequently, all software licenses within the scope
of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. For public business entities, the
FASB decided that the amendments will be effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods,
beginning after December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the amendment will be effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2015, and interim periods in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for all
entities.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

The
FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-07  Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , which permits a reporting entity, as a practical
expedient, to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. The amendments
in this update remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured
using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures
for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather,
those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient.
The amendments in this update apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment within the related
scope by using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient.

The
FASB has issued No. 2015-10  Technical Corrections and Improvements , which aims to address feedback received from
stakeholders on the Codification and make improvements to GAAP. The amendments in this update represent changes to clarify the
Codification, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected
to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Some
of the amendments will make the Codification easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications,
and improving the presentation of guidance in the Codification. The amendments in this update will apply to all reporting entities
within the scope of the affected accounting guidance. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted.  

The
FASB has issued No. 2015-11 Topic 330, Inventory , which aims to simplify the measurement of inventory by changing
the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory
within the scope of this Update. The amendments in this update do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out
(LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured
using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower
of cost and net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory
method. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  

The
FASB has issued No. 2015-14 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which aims to respond to stakeholders 
requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in Update 2014-09 and to consider feedback received through extensive outreach
with preparers, practitioners, and users of financial statements. The amendments in this update defer the effective date of Update
2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit
plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.

The
FASB has issued No. 2015-16 Topic 805, Business Combinations : Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,
which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or
improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update require that
an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period
in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period s
financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result
of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments
in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion
of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if
the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments
in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Continued   

The
FASB has issued No. 2015-17 Topic 740, Income Taxes : Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which aims to
identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be
reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments
in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial
position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current
requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single
amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this update will align the presentation of deferred
income tax assets and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For public business entities, the amendments
in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December
15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.

Going Concern   

The
Company has incurred negative operating cash flows during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and has an accumulated deficit
at September 30, 2016 and has relied on the Company s registered capital and issuance of convertible notes to fund operations.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had limited cash
resources and management plans to continue its efforts to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings which will be
used to fund operations.

Convertible Promissory Notes   Continued   

Convertible
promissory note of $350,000 issued to Hanover Holdings I, LLC on May 30, 2014   

On
May 30, 2014, or the Closing Date, we entered into a securities purchase agreement dated as of the Closing Date (the  Purchase
Agreement ) with Hanover Holdings I, LLC, a New York limited liability company ( Hanover ). Pursuant to the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, Hanover purchased from us on the Closing Date (i) a senior convertible note with an initial principal
amount of $350,000 (the  Convertible Note ) and (ii) a warrant to acquire up 3,716,091 shares of our common stock
(the  Warrant ), for a total purchase price of $250,000. The Convertible Note was issued with an original issue discount
of approximately 28.57%.  

$40,000
of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note (together with any accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such
portion of the principal amount) shall be automatically extinguished (without any cash payment by us) if (i) we have properly
filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on or prior to July 14, 2014, or the Filing
Deadline, covering the resale by Hanover of the shares of common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Note
and (ii) no event of default or an event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute an event of default
has occurred on or prior to such date. Moreover, $60,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note (together
with any accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such portion of the principal amount) shall be automatically extinguished
(without any cash payment by us) if (i) the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the earlier
of (i) the 120th calendar day after the Closing Date and (ii) the fifth business day after the date we are notified by the SEC
that such registration statement will not be reviewed or will not be subject to further review (the  Effectiveness Deadline ),
and the prospectus contained therein is available for use by Hanover for the resale by Hanover of the shares of common stock issued
or issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Note and (ii) no event of default or an event that with the passage of time or
giving of notice would constitute an event of default has occurred on or prior to such date.  

The
Convertible Note matures on May 30, 2016 (subject to extension as provided in the Convertible Note) and, in addition to the approximately
28.57% original issue discount, accrues interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum. The Convertible Note is convertible at any time,
in whole or in part, at Hanover s option into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share at a conversion price
equal to the lesser of (i) the product of (x) the arithmetic average of the lowest three (3) trade prices of our common stock
during the 10 consecutive trading days ending and including the trading day immediately preceding the applicable conversion date
and (y) 65%, and (ii) $0.12 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations or other similar transactions).
The Warrant entitles Hanover to purchase up to 3,716,091 shares of our common stock (the  Share Amount ) at any time
for a period of one year from the Closing Date at an exercise price equal to the lesser of (i) the product of (x) the arithmetic
average of the lowest three (3) VWAPs of the common stock during preceding ten (10) consecutive trading days and (y) sixty-five
percent (65%), and (B) $0.12 (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other similar transaction)
(the  Exercise Price ). The Warrant may only be exercised for cash and we have the right to accept or decline any
exercise of the Warrant by Hanover. If at any time the Share Amount is less than the quotient of $150,000 and the Exercise Price
(the  Required Share Amount ), then the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant shall automatically
be increased by such number of shares equal to the difference of the Required Share Amount less the Share Amount.  

At
no time will Hanover be entitled to convert any portion of the Convertible Note or exercise any portion of the Warrant to the
extent that after such conversion or exercise, Hanover (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own more than 4.99% of
the outstanding shares of our common stock as of such date (the  Maximum Percentage ). The Maximum Percentage may
be raised to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% at the option of Hanover upon at least 61 days  prior notice to
us, or lowered to any other percentage, at the option of Hanover, at any time.  

The
Convertible Note includes customary event of default provisions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Hanover may require
us to pay in cash the greater of (i) the product of (A) the amount to be redeemed multiplied by (B) 135% (or 100% if an insolvency
related event of default) and (ii) the product of (X) the conversion price in effect at that time multiplied by (Y) the product
of (1) 135% (or 100% if an insolvency related event of default) multiplied by (2) the greatest closing sale price of our common
stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding such event of default and ending on the
date we make the entire payment required to be made under this provision.

Income Tax   

We
are subject to income tax in the United States, Hong Kong and PRC.  

The
Company s subsidiaries, CC Power and CC Investment are incorporated in PRC and are subjected to PRC enterprises income tax
at the applicable tax rates on the taxable income as reported in their Chinese statutory accounts in accordance with the relevant
enterprises income tax laws ( EIT Law ). The subsidiaries locate in Shenzhen, a special economic region, where companies
are allowed to gradually phase into the 25% statutory tax rate. For 2016 and 2015, the statutory income tax rate is 25%. The open
tax years in PRC are 2010-2015.  

CC
Mobility is incorporated in Hong Kong and is subjected to Hong Kong corporate income tax at 16.5% statutory income tax rate. No
Hong Kong profits tax has been provided in the financial statements, as the Company did not have any assessable profits for the
nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The open tax year for CC Mobility in Hong Kong are 2012-2015.  

The
Company has no income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 because it has not net assessable income.  

The
Company applied the provisions of ASC 740.10.50,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , which provides clarification
related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. ASC 740.10.50
prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected
to be taken, in a tax return. ASC 740.10.50 also provides guidance related to, among other things, classification, accounting
for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and disclosure requirements. The Company recognizes accrued interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the statements of operation. The Company s
policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense.  

The
following table sets forth the components of deferred income taxes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has net operating losses carry forward of $558,913 in the U.S. and $535,394 in Hong Kong and
PRC available to offset future taxable income. They will begin to expire in 2030 and 2016, respectively. We provided for a full
valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of $0 on the expected future tax benefits from the net operating loss carry
forwards as management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized in the future.  

The
Company did not recognize any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the six months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.

Earnings (loss) per share   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. Diluted loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the
effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the if-converted method for the convertible notes
and preferred stock and the treasury stock method for warrants and options. The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net loss per share:  

Since
the company is suffering losses, the dilutive loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, because the convertible notes are anti-dilutive.

of Incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 800,000,000 to 4,200,000,000.  

On
July 5, 2011, we entered into a voluntary share exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Shenzhen CC Power
Corporation ( CC Power ), a company organized under the laws of the People s Republic of China (PRC), CC Mobility
Limited ( CC Mobility ), a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong, and the shareholders of CC Mobility. As
a result of the Exchange Transaction, CC Mobility became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we control the business and operations
of CC Power.  

On
September 22, 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Xinjiang Silvercreek Digital Technology Co., Ltd. ( Silvercreek )
pursuant to which we acquired certain assets of Silvercreek (the  Assets ) relating to an online sports lottery business
in exchange for the issuance of up to 80,000,000 shares ( Shares ) of common stock of the Company.  

Our
lottery business aggregates and processes lottery purchase orders, deriving revenue from service fees paid by local sports lottery
administration centers for the purchase orders of sports lottery products directed to such centers. We offer a comprehensive and
integrated suite of online lottery services in China. We hope that the merging of our lottery business with our existing mobile
technologies, partners, and customers, will provide a platform for growth in this industry.  

Recent
Developments   

On
May 6, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 to Biz Wit Holdings Ltd.,
a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands ( Biz Wit ). The president, beneficial owner and
control person of Biz Wit is Mr. Zhixiong Wei, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of the Company
( Mr. Wei ). On May 18, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $700,000
to Sino Secure International (Holdings) Limited, a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands ( Sino
Secure ). On October 14, 2016, Biz Wit converted $500,000 of the principal amount outstanding under its note into shares
of our common stock, and Sino Secure converted the entire principal amount of $700,000 under its note into shares of our common
stock, at a conversion price of $0.001 per share. The conversion of these notes resulted in an issuance of 500,000,000 shares
of common stock to Biz Wit, and an issuance of 700,000,000 shares of common stock to Sino Secure. We believe these issuances may
have effected a change of control of the Company because of the significant ownership percentages acquired by each of Biz Wit
and Sino Secure.  

Additionally,
on August 25, 2016, Mr. Wei acquired a 100% equity interest in CC Power, pursuant an Agreement on Equity Transfer between Mr.
Wei and Xili Wang, our former Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. The Agreement on Equity Transfer provides that Mr. Wei acquired
all of the outstanding equity of CC Power for the price of RMB 1 Yuan.  

On
September 1, 2016, following the expiration of management agreements for, and resignations of, each of Mr. Renyan Ge and Ms. Wang,
the Board appointed Mr. Wei as our new Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors and Ms. Li Ouyang as our
new Chief Financial Officer.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Overview

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash and equivalents on hand of $106,369 and total current liabilities of $3,571,407. We believe
that our cash on hand and working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through December 31, 2016.
To meet our future development plan, we will need to meet our revenue objectives and/or sell additional equity and debt securities,
which could result in dilution to current shareholders.  

On
September 1, 2014, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CC Power, entered into a credit loan facility with Mr. Zhixiong Wei of
up to RMB 5,000,000 at 15% simple interest. Interest is payable monthly, and any loans are due within 15 days prior written notice.
The loans may be paid in cash or in common stock of our Company at a conversion price equal to 90% of the average closing price
of our common stock for the ten days prior to conversion. Any loans under this facility are guaranteed by our Company. As of September
30, 2016, CC Power owes US$0.  

On
May 6, 2016, we entered into a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of USD $1,000,000 (the  Biz Wit Note )
with Biz Wit Holdings Ltd. ( Biz Wit ). Biz Wit s beneficial owner and control person is Mr. Wei. The Biz Wit
Note matures on December 31, 2016 and accrues interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum. The Biz Wit Note is convertible at any time
prior to August 6, 2016, in whole or in part, at Biz Wit s option into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price
equal to $0.001 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations or other similar transactions). On October
14, 2016, Biz Wit converted $500,000 of the principal amount outstanding under the Biz Wit Note into 500,000,000 shares of the
Company s common stock, which resulted in a reduction of the principal amount outstanding under the Biz Wit Note to $500,000.  

On
May 18, 2016, we entered into the Sino Secure Note and the Lei Pan note, in the aggregate principal amount of USD $1,000,000 (collectively,
the  Investor Notes ) with two foreign accredited investors (the  Investors ). The Investor Notes mature
on December 31, 2016 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum. The Investor Notes are convertible at any time prior to
August 18, 2016, in whole or in part, at the Investors  option into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price equal
to $0.001 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations or other similar transactions). On October 14, 2016,
Sino Secure converted the entire principal amount outstanding under the Sino Secure Note to 700,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock, which resulted in a reduction of the principal amount outstanding under the Sino Secure Note to $nil.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding indebtedness pursuant to convertible notes issued to various accredited investors in
the aggregate principal amount of $2,450,000.  

Substantially
all of our current revenues are earned by CC Power, our PRC subsidiary. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC
subsidiary to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. Pursuant to the law of PRC on foreign-capital
enterprises, when CC Power decides to distribute profits, reserve funds and bonus and welfare funds for workers and staff members
shall be withdrawn from the profits after a foreign-capital enterprise has paid income tax in accordance with the provisions of
the Chinese tax law. The proportion of reserve funds to be withdrawn shall not be lower than 10% of the total amount of profits
after payment of tax; the withdrawal of reserve funds may be stopped when the total cumulative reserve has reached 50% of the
registered capital. The proportion of bonus and welfare funds for workers and staff members to be withdrawn shall be determined
by the foreign-capital enterprise of its own accord. Companies may be subject to a fine up to 5,000 RMB as a result of non-compliance
of such rules. The registered capital of CC Power is $345,864 (RMB 2,526,000).  

We
are currently seeking both short term working capital to finance current operations, as well as significant amounts of long term
capital to execute our business plan and ultimately offer our products in the U.S. market. We project that to keep operations
at our current level, approximately $900,000 in revenue and working capital will be required over the next 12 months to cover
monthly expenses of $75,000. In order to meet our planned strategic two to four acquisitions, we estimate requiring up to $3,000,000
in capital. As of June 30, 2016, we had secured $2,000,000 in additional capital by issuing convertible promissory notes. We will
consider additional debt or equity offerings or institutional borrowings as potential means of financing; however, there are no
assurances we will be successful in obtaining favorable financing terms.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to its shares and classified as shareholder s equity
or that are not reflected in its consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do
not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support
to it or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with it.  

Critical
Accounting Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates used
in preparing its financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Certain
of our accounting policies require higher degrees of professional judgment than others in their application. These include allowance
for doubtful accounts, depreciation and impairment of fixed assets, and income tax. Management evaluates all of its estimates
and judgments on an ongoing basis.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    

Foreign
Exchange Rates    

Our
financial instruments consist mainly of cash, borrowings and accounts receivable. The objective of our policies is to mitigate
potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in exchange
rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers
regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expect future rates.  

The
value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China s political
and economic conditions. Since July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. The RMB may appreciate or depreciate
significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities
may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.  

Because
substantially all of our earnings, cash and assets are currently denominated in RMB, appreciation or depreciation in the value
of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect
to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency
exchange rates as the financial results of our Chinese operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollar upon consolidation.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against the RMB, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased
net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses,
and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the RMB. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations
on transactions denominated in RMB other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated
statement of operations. Our operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to,
differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and
foreign exchange rate volatility.  

Considering
the RMB balance of our cash as of September 30, 2016, which amounted to US $103,348, a 1.0% change in the exchange rates between
the RMB and the U.S. dollar would result in an increase or decrease of approximately US$1,033 of the balance.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Mr. Wei, our new Chief
Executive Officer (who is our Principal Executive Officer) and Ms. Ouyang, our new Chief Financial Officer (who is our Principal
Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based
upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the  SEC ) rules and forms. This conclusion is based on findings
that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

In
performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the following material weaknesses:  

i)  
      We
    have insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal controls.
    As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected
    on a timely basis.   

ii)  
      We
    do not have an audit committee. While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s
    view that to have an audit committee, comprised of independent board members, is an important entity-level control over our
    financial statements.   

iii)  
      We
    did not perform an entity level risk assessment to evaluate the implication of relevant risks on financial reporting, including
    the impact of potential fraud-related risks and the risks related to non-routine transactions, if any, on our internal control
    over financial reporting. Lack of an entity-level risk assessment constituted an internal control design deficiency which
    resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material error would not have been prevented or detected, and constituted
    a material weakness.   

Our
management feels the weaknesses identified above have not had any material effect on our financial results. However, we are currently
reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the near
term, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate
resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.  

Our
management team will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal
controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements
or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30,
2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected.
