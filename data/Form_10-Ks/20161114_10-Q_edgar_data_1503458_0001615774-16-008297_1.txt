Note 1.   
       Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Business  

Foothills Exploration,
Inc., ( Company  or  Foothills Exploration ) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 13, 2010
under the name of  Key Link Assets Corp.  for the purpose of acquiring a portfolio of heavily discounted real estate
properties in the Chicago metropolitan area. The Company changed its focus and planned to acquire small and medium sized grocery
stores in non-urban locales that are not directly served by large national supermarket chains. 

On May 2, 2016, Foothills
Petroleum Inc. a Nevada corporation ( FPI ) acquired over 14.1 pre split (56.4 post split) million shares of the Company s
common stock constituting approximately 96% of our then issued and outstanding shares ( FPI Acquired Shares ). As of
May 16, 2016 we effected a 4:1 forward split of our shares of common stock. 

On May 27, 2016 we
entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with shareholders of FPI whereby we acquired all of the outstanding shares of FPI in exchange
for 4,500,000 shares of our common stock and also issued 1,503,759 shares of our common stock on automatic conversion of debt (please
see discussion below under Company's Business Overview) for an aggregate of 6,003,759 shares of our common stock (the  Share
Exchange ). As a result of the Share Exchange, FPI became our wholly owned subsidiary and the FPI Acquired Shares were returned
to treasury and deemed cancelled. For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition and
has been treated as a recapitalization of the Company with FPI considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements
of the accounting acquirer became the financial statements of the registrant. The completion of the Share Exchange resulted in
a change of control. The FPI Shareholders obtained approximately 96% of voting control on the date of Share Exchange. FPI was the
acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company was the acquired company. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements after the acquisition include the balance sheets of both companies at historical cost, the historical results of FPI
and the results of the Company from the acquisition date. All share and per share information in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization. 

Prior to the Share
Exchange, we had minimal assets and recognized no revenues from operations, and were accordingly classified as a shell company.
On June 24, 2016, we filed an amendment to our Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed on June 10, 2016, indicating that we
were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. In light of closing the Share Exchange transaction
with the shareholders of FPI the Company became actively engaged in oil and gas operations through its wholly owned subsidiary. 

On June 30, 2016,
we entered into a securities purchase agreement to sell 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds
totaling $2,000,000, and in July 2016, the Company received the funds. For a more complete description of this transaction please
see our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on July 7, 2016. 

On August 4, 2016
we were advised that the Financial Industry Regulatory Association had approved (i) our name change from Key Link Assets Corp.
to Foothills Exploration, Inc., and (ii) a change of trading symbol from KYLK to FTXP. Please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC
on August 9, 2016. 

On August
18, 2016 the Company appointed Ritchie Lanclos as Executive Vice President of the Company and as Vice President of Exploration
of its wholly owned subsidiary, Foothills Petroleum, Inc. ( FPI ), and appointed Eleazar Ovalle as Executive Vice President
of the Company and Vice President of Geology   Geophysical of FPI.   

FPI has
agreed to pay Mr. Lanclos an annual salary of $84,000 upon successful completion of a 90 day probationary period. Mr. Lanclos was
entitled to receive a $10,000 bonus upon commencement of employment and will also be entitled to receive bonuses that will be based
on performance standards that will be established by FPI. Mr. Lanclos will receive 100,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) of the
Company of which (i) 20,000 shall vest 180 days from August 15, 2016, (ii) another 20,000 shall vest 270 days from August 15, 2016
and (iii) the remaining 60,000 shall vest 365 days from August 15, 2016. Upon approval of the Company s Board of Directors,
Mr. Lanclos may become eligible to participate in the Company s equity incentive plan, should one be established.  

FPI has
agreed to pay Mr. Ovalle an annual salary of $84,000 upon successful completion of a 90 day probationary period. Mr. Ovalle was
entitled to receive a $10,000 bonus upon commencement of employment and will also be entitled to receive bonuses that will be based
on performance standards and goals that will be established by FPI. Mr. Ovalle will receive 100,000 restricted stock units (RSUs)
of the Company of which (i) 20,000 shall vest 180 days from August 15, 2016, (ii) another 20,000 shall vest 270 days from August
15, 2016 and (iii) the remaining 60,000 shall vest 365 days from August 15, 2016. Upon approval by the Company s Board of
Directors, Mr. Ovalle may become eligible to participate in the Company s equity incentive plan, should one be established.

In connection
with the hiring of Ritchie Lanclos and Eleazar Ovalle, FPI agreed to pay Wilshire Energy Partners LLC, one of our principal shareholders,
pursuant to a Services Agreement entered into by and between FPI and Wilshire Energy Partners, a fee of 25% of gross annual salary,
including all cash and equity compensation, but excluding any bonuses to be received by Mr. Lanclos and Mr. Ovalle. FPI has agreed
to pay Wilshire Energy Partners $50,000 for its services in recruiting Messrs. Lanclos and Ovalle to the Company and FPI management
teams. In the event either of Mr. Lanclos or Mr. Ovalle leaves FPI of his own volition or is terminated for cause within 90 days
from commencement of their employment, Wilshire Energy Partners shall refund FPI 100% of fees received, minus $2,500.  

On September
2, 2016, Shawn P. Clark resigned as Interim Chief Financial Officer and member of the Board of Directors of Foothills Exploration,
Inc. In connection with Mr. Clark s resignation, there were no disagreements with the Company, known to an executive officer
of the Company, as defined in 17 CFR 240.3b-7, on any matter relating to the Company s operations, policies or practices.  

Nature of Operations  

FPI was incorporated
in Nevada in December 2015. FPI is an independent oil and gas exploration company with a focus on the acquisition and development
of oil and gas properties in the Rockies and Gulf Coast. FPI seeks to acquire dislocated and underdeveloped oil and gas assets
and maximize those assets to create shareholder value (the  Business ). Its principal obligations, consisting of convertible
promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $1,000,000 plus interest accruing at a rate of 8% per annum (the  Note ),
issued to a single investor as part of convertible debt financing, was converted into 1,503,759 shares of common stock of the Company
at the closing of the Share Exchange transaction at a conversion price of $0.665 per share with any accrued and outstanding interest
under the Note waived. 

From its inception in December 2015 through the date of the Share Exchange, FPI produced no revenues from
its business and principal properties and is currently an exploration stage company. Prior to January 2016, FPI had minimal operations
that were focused mainly on administrative activities connected to the identification and evaluation of potential oil and gas prospects
and other potential leasehold acquisitions in our geographical areas of interest. As of September 30, 2016, FPI had acquired the
rights to 41,421 acres of oil and gas property in the state of Wyoming. Please see Note 8, Subsequent Events, for additional acreage
obtained subsequent to September 30, 2016. 

FPI s technical
team and strategic advisors have a proven track record of finding, exploiting and developing oil resources in the Rockies and Gulf
Coast, with a deep technical and operational knowledge of the area. 

Basis of Presentation and Functional Currency  

These condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and
are expressed in United States dollars (USD), and should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have
been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year. The Company was formed on December 17, 2015, therefore there are no comparative financial statements for the
period for three and nine months statement of operations and cash flows. 

Exploration Stage  

The Company has not produced revenues from
its principal business and is in the exploration stage.  The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development
and production of oil and gas properties.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had acquired the rights to 41,421 acres
of oil and gas property in the state of Wyoming through its transaction with the shareholders of FPI, and other acquisitions made
by the Company since its inception. 

The Company s success will depend in
large part on its ability to obtain and develop oil and gas interests within the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions. There can
be no assurance that oil and gas properties obtained by the Company will contain reserves or that properties with reserves will
be profitable to extract. The Company will be subject to local and national laws and regulations which could impact its ability
to execute its business plan. 

As discussed in Note 2, the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.  On
June 30, 2016, the Company sold 3,007,519 shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount of $2,000,000, and  in
July 2016 the Company received the $2,000,000 funding. 

7   

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.  Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of those investments approximates
their fair market value due to their short maturity and liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amount on
deposit with financial institutions, which amounts may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced
any losses on such accounts and it does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company had no cash equivalents. 

Oil and Gas Properties  

The Company follows the full cost method of
accounting for its investments in oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method, all costs associated with the exploration
of properties are capitalized into appropriate cost centers within the full cost pool. Internal costs that are capitalized are
limited to those costs that can be directly identified with acquisition, exploration, and development activities undertaken and
do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead, or similar activities. Cost centers are established
on a country-by-country basis. 

Capitalized costs within the cost centers are
amortized on the unit-of-production basis using proved oil and gas reserves. The cost of investments in unevaluated properties
and major development projects are excluded from capitalized costs to be amortized until it is determined whether or not proved
reserves can be assigned to the properties. Until such a determination is made, the properties are assessed annually to ascertain
whether impairment has occurred. The costs of drilling exploratory dry holes are included in the amortization base immediately
upon determination that the well is dry. 

For each cost center, capitalized costs are
subject to an annual ceiling test, in which the costs shall not exceed the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is equal
to: (i) the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices of oil and gas reserves (with consideration
of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas
reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be
incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of ten percent and assuming continuation
of existing economic conditions; plus (ii) the cost of properties not being amortized; plus (iii) the lower of cost or estimated
fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; and less (iv) income tax effects related to differences
between the book and tax basis of the properties. If unamortized costs capitalized within a cost center, less related deferred
income taxes, exceed the cost center ceiling, the excess is charged to expense and separately disclosed during the period in which
the excess occurs. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

For certain of the Company s financial
instruments, including cash and equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term
debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,  Financial
Instruments,  defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement
that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets
for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values
because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current
market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.   

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   

8   

The Company analyzes all financial instruments
with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,  and ASC 815. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not
identify any assets and liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at fair value. 

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share  

The Company computes earnings per share under
ASC 260-10,  Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable
to the common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (the denominator)
during the reporting periods.  Diluted loss per share is computed by increasing the denominator by the weighted average number
of additional shares that could have been outstanding from securities convertible into common stock (using the  treasury
stock  method), unless their effect on net loss per share is anti-dilutive. There were 225,000 potentially dilutive shares,
which include outstanding warrants, for the period ended September 30, 2016. The potential shares are excluded from the determination
of basic and diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

All share-based payments, including grants
of stock to employees, directors and consultants, are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based upon their estimated
fair values. 

The Company s accounting policy for equity
instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows ASC Topic 505. As such, the value of the
applicable stock-based compensation is periodically re-measured and income or expense is recognized during their vesting terms.
The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which
a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor s
performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is primarily
recognized over the term of the consulting agreement. In accordance with FASB guidance, an asset acquired in exchange for the issuance
of fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments should not be presented or classified as an offset to equity on the grantor s
balance sheet once the equity instrument is granted for accounting purposes. 

Principles of Consolidation  

These condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Foothills Exploration, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary Foothills Petroleum Inc. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There were various updates recently issued,
most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Note 2.   
       Going Concern    

As shown in the accompanying financial statements,
the Company has incurred an accumulated loss of $1,426,488 through September 30, 2016, and had working capital of $1,533,410 at
September 30, 2016. The Company is subject to those risks associated with exploration stage companies.  The Company has
sustained losses since inception and additional debt and equity financing will be required by the Company to fund its development
activities and to monetize economically recoverable oil and gas reserves. 

On June 30, 2016, the Company sold 3,007,519 shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount of $2,000,000
and in July 2016, the Company received the $2,000,000 funding.  As a result,  Management
believes that its existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund its operations for the next nine (9) months. However, no assurance
can be given that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing to further its ongoing activities so that profitable
operations can be attained. The Company also continues to search for producing and/or additional productive properties and seeks
to strategically lease additional acreage positions adjoining leases currently owned by the Company.  There can be no
assurance that the Company's efforts will be successful, or that those efforts will translate in a beneficial manner to the Company.
The accompanying statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and/or liabilities
that might be necessary, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 3.   
       Share Exchange Agreement    

On May 2, 2016, Foothills Petroleum Inc., a
Nevada corporation ( FPI ) acquired over 14.1 pre split (56.4 post split) million shares of Key Link s common
stock from five persons constituting approximately 96% of our issued and outstanding shares (the  FPI Acquired Shares ).
In conjunction with this purchase we incurred a charge of $316,035 for the purchase of these shares. Please see our Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on May 6, 2016. 

As of May 16, 2016, the Company effected a
4:1 forward split of our shares of common stock. Please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 19, 2016. 

On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a
Share Exchange Agreement ( Share Exchange Agreement ) with the shareholders of FPI whereby the Company acquired all of
the outstanding shares of FPI for an aggregate of 6,003,759 shares of common stock of which 4,500,000 shares of common stock were
issued to Wilshire Energy Partners, LLC ( Wilshire ) and 1,503,759 of shares of common stock were issuable to Alternus
Capital Holdings Ltd. ( Alternus ) (the  Share Exchange ). As a result of the Share Exchange, FPI became
the Company s wholly owned subsidiary and the FPI Acquired Shares were subsequently returned to treasury, deemed canceled
and no longer outstanding.   

The Company also exchanged warrants to purchase
700,000 shares of FPI s common stock that were issued to Wilshire for a like amount of warrants to purchase shares of Key
Link s common stock (the  Wilshire Warrants ). The Wilshire Warrants: 

have
a term of five years;  

do
not have a cashless exercise feature; and  

are
not exercisable for one year from the date of issuance.  

Following the closing of the Share Exchange
transaction the Company had approximately 8,363,759 shares of common stock outstanding (excluding the FPI Acquired Shares, which
are deemed canceled following the Share Exchange), of which Wilshire and Alternus own in the aggregate 6,003,759 shares, or approximately
52% of the outstanding common stock. As of the date of this filing the Company has 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized
of which no shares are issued and outstanding.   

Note 4.   
       Oil and Gas Properties    

Upon organization
of Foothills Petroleum Inc., on December 24, 2015, Wilshire Energy Partners LLC contributed its 100% membership interest in Foothills
Exploration, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, to FPI in exchange for 4,500,000 shares of FPI's common stock. At the time
of contribution Wilshire Energy Partners LLC had acquired and owned rights to 38,120 acres of oil and gas leases in the State of
Wyoming (as described above in Note 1, Nature of Operations) . On completion of the Share Exchange, effective May 27, 2016, Wilshire
Energy Partners LLC exchanged its FPI shares for 4,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. As a result the Company owns 100%
of FPI and Foothills Exploration, LLC is now a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company that retains title to these oil
and gas leases.    This transaction is treated as the founding
transaction by the Company. The asset was valued at $72,430 at the time of transfer based on costs associated with the payment
of lease bonuses, fees and taxes paid during the formation of the asset.   

On March 29, 2016, FPI acquired a 35% working interest in the Ladysmith Anticline prospect that is located
in Fremont County, Wyoming. Total acreage position is 3,061 acres located between the Great Divide/Greater Green River Basin and
the Wind River Basin, in return for covering certain costs of operation in the amount of $20,000, and to a share of the working
interest in the land. The primary target zones are the variable Phosphoria and Tensleep sandstone with secondary considerations
in the Madison limestone and Flathead sandstone. The prospect generation was based on a licensed 2-D seismic comprising of two
seismic lines covering the Chevron/Echo   Greater Green River Basin. The asset is valued at $20,000 based on the agreement.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company capitalized an additional $97,920 in costs related to this asset.

       Notes Payable

promissory note in the amount of $600,000 with Alternus Capital Holdings Limited, a BVI company. The two-year note matures on December
23, 2017, and accrues interest at 8% per year. By its terms the note was automatically required to convert the outstanding principal
and interest due under the terms of the note upon a merger or other combination occurring between FPI and an entity with shares
listed for trading ( Pubco ). The conversion price in the note was established at $0.665 per share, (the  Conversion

FPI received an additional $400,000 from Alternus Capital Holdings Limited. Under the agreements between Alternus and FPI, Alternus
had the right but not the obligation to subscribe for an aggregate of up to $3,500,000 of convertible notes which, in the event
of that full subscription would convert into not less than 30% of the outstanding shares of Pubco. Through May 27, 2016, the date
of the Share Exchange, Alternus had invested $1,000,000 and based on the Conversion Price 1,503,759 shares of Common Stock of Pubco
(Key Link) were issued in full satisfaction of its two notes.

 expect,   intend,   may,   might,   potential,   predict, 
 project,   should  or other similar words. 

By their very nature, forward-looking statements
require us to make assumptions that may not materialize or that may not be accurate. Forward-looking statements are subject to
known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements
to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such factors include, among others: changes in oil or

uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement
or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, the proximity
to and capacity of transportation facilities, uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or
regulatory developments affecting our business, and the other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus and in other
documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC, all of which are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements may include
statements about: 

our
business strategy;  

our reserves or reserves that may expect to develop;   

our cash flows and liquidity;

our future operating results;   

estimated future reserves and the present value thereof; and   

our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this report that are not historical.   

Although we believe that the expectations conveyed
by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available to us on the date such forward-looking statements
were made, no assurances can be given as to future results, levels of activity, achievements or financial condition. 

You should not place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statement and should recognize that the statements are predictions of future results, which may not occur as anticipated.
Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due
to the risks and uncertainties described above, as well as others not now anticipated. The impact of any one factor on a particular
forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as such factors are interdependent upon other factors. The foregoing
statements are not exclusive and further information concerning us, including factors that potentially could materially affect
our financial results, may emerge from time to time. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results
or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law, including the securities
laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC.

History   

Foothills Exploration,
Inc., ( Company  or  Foothills Exploration ) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 13, 2010
under the name of  Key Link Assets Corp.  for the purpose of acquiring a portfolio of heavily discounted real estate
properties in the Chicago metropolitan area. The Company changed its focus and planned to acquire small and medium sized grocery
stores in non-urban locales that are not directly served by large national supermarket chains. 

On May 2, 2016, Foothills
Petroleum Inc., a Nevada corporation ( FPI ) acquired approximately 14.1 pre split (56.4 post split) million shares
of the Company s common stock constituting approximately 96% of our then issued and outstanding shares ( FPI Acquired
Shares ). As of May 16, 2016, we effected a 4:1 forward split of our shares of common stock. On May 27, 2016, we entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of FPI whereby we acquired all of the outstanding shares of FPI for 4,500,000
shares and also issued 1,503,759 shares on automatic conversion of debt (please see discussion below under Company's Business
Overview) for an aggregate of 6,003,759 shares of our common stock (the  Share Exchange ). As a result of the Share
Exchange, FPI became our wholly owned subsidiary and the FPI Acquired Shares were returned to treasury and deemed cancelled. 

Prior to the Share
Exchange, we had minimal assets and recognized no revenues from operations, and were accordingly classified as a shell company.
On June 24, 2016, we filed an amendment to our Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed on June 10, 2016, indicating that we
were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act. In light of closing of Share Exchange transaction with
FPI, the Company became actively engaged in oil and gas operations through its wholly owned subsidiary. 

On June 30, 2016,
we completed a sale of 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds totaling $2,000,000. For a more complete
description of this transaction please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2016. 

On August 4, 2016,
we were advised that the Financial Industry Regulatory Association had approved (i) our name change from Key Link Assets Corp.
to Foothills Exploration, Inc., and (ii) a change of trading symbol from KYLK to FTXP. Please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC
on August 9, 2016. 

On October 5, 2016,
the Company launched its Exploration Division and opened new office in Houston to support division s staff. The Company s
Exploration Division consists of geologists and petroleum engineers engaged in the exploration and development of hydrocarbons
and tasked with building a portfolio of exploration projects in the Gulf Coast region.

FPI s
Business Overview   

FPI was incorporated
in Nevada in December 2015. FPI is an independent oil and gas exploration company with a focus on the acquisition and development
of oil and gas properties in the Rockies and Gulf Coast. FPI seeks to acquire dislocated and underdeveloped oil and gas assets
and maximize those assets to create shareholder value (the  Business ). Its principal obligations, consisting of convertible
promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $1,000,000, plus interest accruing at a rate of 8% per annum (the  Note ),
issued to a single investor as part of convertible debt financing, was converted into 1,503,759 shares of common stock of the Company
at the closing of the Share Exchange transaction at a conversion price of $0.665 per share with any accrued and outstanding interest
under the Note waived. 

From its inception in December 2015 through the date of the Share Exchange, FPI has produced no revenues from
its business and principal properties and is currently an exploration stage company. Prior to January 2016, FPI had minimal operations
that were focused mainly on administrative activities connected to the identification and evaluation of potential oil and gas prospects
and other potential leasehold acquisitions in our geographical areas of interest. As of September 30, 2016, FPI had acquired the
rights to 41,421 acres of oil and gas property in the state of Wyoming, through Foothills Exploration, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary
acquired by FPI in connection with its organization in December 2015. 

FPI s technical
team and strategic advisors have a proven track record of finding, exploiting and developing oil resources in the Rockies and Gulf
Coast, with a deep technical and operational knowledge of the area. 

Market Environment   

Oil pricing has declined
significantly over the last 24-months from a 2014 high of over $120 a barrel and have, in the opinion of the Company, created attractive
new opportunities to acquire oil and gas assets at what we believe to be favorable pricing. The International Energy Agency recently
highlighted that capital expenditures on new energy (exploration) declined 16% year-over-year in 2014, followed up by another 20%
decline in 2015 year-over-year, respectively. With oil prices falling below $30 a barrel in 2016 at one point, and WTI trading
at about $40 a barrel on August 1, 2016 (and approximately $45 a barrel on November 9, 2016), the Company currently anticipates
a 3rd consecutive year of material spending cutbacks for new supply globally. 

In the U.S., the Energy
Information Administration (EIA) in its January 12, 2016 short-term energy outlook highlighted that consumption for gasoline increased
by 270,000 barrels per day in 2015 to an average of 9.2 million barrels per day, representing a year-over-year growth of 2.6% and
just below the record high set in 2007 of 9.3 million barrels per day. The EIA forecasts that total global demand for petroleum
to grow by 1.4 million barrels per day from 2015 s 93.7 million per day to 95.2 million by the end of 2016, and similar growth
in 2017 to 96.6 million per day where demand out strips supplies by the 4Q 2017. For these and other domestic reasons, FPI s
medium to long-term outlook is for oil and gas prices to be at sustainable higher levels. No assurance can be given that this outlook
will prove to be accurate. 

Our Strategy   

FPI s strategic
objective is to build a portfolio of producing properties that have low operating costs, long lived reserves and upside development
potential. FPI s goal is to build a land bank of over 200,000 acres of proven, probable and prospective reserves during this
period of relatively low commodity pricing. FPI intends to accomplish this by acquiring oil and gas properties with attractive
valuation metrics and appealing geological risk/reward profiles that are better positioned to benefit from an improvement in commodity
prices. 

FPI's primary focus
is the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions, where its consultants and technical staff have successfully conducted oil and gas
operations. FPI believes its geographical focus and regional experience coupled with strategic industry relationships will advantageously
position them to acquire quality oil and gas assets at attractive valuations in the current environment. 

FPI s acquisitions
and roll up strategy is based on identifying undercapitalized, yet attractive oil and gas assets selling at a discount to intrinsic
value. FPI focuses on acquiring oil and gas assets that have existing production, with existing infrastructure and future developmental
potential. Once it acquires oil and gas assets, FPI expects to target adjacent oil and gas properties with similar characteristics
to bolt on and increase its geographical acreage position. By consolidating and exploiting additional acreage and rolling it up
into FPI, management believes that it may achieve efficiencies and be able to further create shareholder value. 

FPI s Wyoming Properties   

The principal assets
currently owned by FPI consist of non-producing, prospective mineral leases located in Wyoming. 

17   

Springs Prospect  

The Springs Prospect,
consisting of 38,120 contiguous acres, is a multiple objective oil resource play in the Greater Green River Basin. The prospect s
unconventional target is a Niobrara and Mowry fractured shale. Numerous oil and gas shows in the Niobara and Mowry shales surround
the prospect acreage. FPI has also identified and mapped conventional drilling targets in the Muddy and Tensleep throughout the
prospect area. Although FPI plans to acquire 3-D Seismic and complete its geologic assessment in the current fiscal year, no assurance
can be given that it will be able to do so. 

Ladysmith Prospect  

On March 29, 2016,
FPI acquired a 35% working interest in the Ladysmith Anticline prospect that is located in Fremont County, Wyoming. This prospect
in entirety amounts to 3,061 acres and is located between the Great Divide/Greater Green River Basin and the Wind River Basin.
The primary target zones are the variable Phosphoria and Tensleep sandstone with secondary considerations in the Madison limestone
and Flathead sandstone. The prospect generation was based on a licensed 2-D seismic comprising of two seismic lines covering the
Chevron/Echo   Greater Green River Basin. On August 24, 2016, the Company acquired a 240-acre fee lease from the Freemont
Sheep Company covering lands immediately adjacent to the Ladysmith Prospect lands. 

Plan of Operations   

Over the near-term
with energy prices depressed, FPI believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on the current low price environment. Current
energy prices have exposed attractive U.S. based assets that are poorly capitalized, which are now selling at discounted prices,
providing multiple entry points to acquire attractive oil and gas assets. FPI intends to acquire distressed oil and gas assets
as well as non-core assets from larger exploration and production companies seeking to raise cash to pay down debt and shore up
their balance sheets. 

In addition to what
management believes to be a favorable macroeconomic environment for acquiring attractive oil and gas assets, FPI intends to leverage
its geographical focus in the Rockies and Gulf Coast. FPI is focused on acquiring smaller operators in a considerably fragmented
oil and gas market and through consolidation, management believes FPI can effectively scale its production and acreage position
and collectively unlock value in the acquired oil and gas assets thereby increasing shareholder value. 

Acquiring additional assets and companies
throughout Rockies   

FPI is targeting acquisitions
in tightly defined geographical areas of interest, which meet certain metrics and future development potential to increase shareholder
value. FPI anticipates that these acquisitions will be funded through the sale of common stock, and from issuance of convertible
debt, other institutional and private borrowing, as well as future reserve based borrowing activities. 

Pursuing the initial
development of the Greater Green River conventional and unconventional assets, FPI plans to drill one or two vertical wells in
the first half of 2017 on the Springs Prospect acreage. FPI anticipates that drilling activities will target the well-established
conventional Muddy and Tensleep formations and unconventional Niobrara and Mowry shale formations. 

Retain Operational Control and Significant
Working Interest   

In its principal acquisition
and development targets, FPI expects to preserve operational control of its development and drilling activities. As the operator
for its projects, FPI retains more control over the timing, selection and process of drilling prospects and completion design,
which enhances its ability to maximize the return on invested capital and gives greater control over the timing, allocation and
amounts of capital expenditures. 

Leasing of Prospective Acreage   

In the course of its
day-to-day business, FPI regularly identifies drilling and development opportunities on additional acreage in its area of interest
that has not yet been leased. Subject to securing additional capital, FPI may take the initiative to lease prospective acreage
in an area of interest and may sell all or any portion of the leased acreage to other companies that want to participate in the
drilling and development of the prospect acreage. 

Government Regulations  

Governmental Regulation
and Environmental Consideration.  

The oil and gas business
in the United States is subject to regulation by both federal and state authorities, particularly with respect to pricing, allowable
rates of production, marketing and environmental matters. 

18   

The production of
crude oil and gas has, in recent years, been the subject of increasing state and federal controls.  No assurance can be given
that newly imposed or changed federal laws will not adversely affect the economic viability of any oil and gas properties we may
acquire in the future.  Federal income and  windfall profit  taxes have in the past affected the economic viability
of such properties. 

The following discussion
provides a brief overview of potential state and federal regulations.  Because FPI to date has acquired specific properties,
and because of the wider range of activities in which it expects to participate, management believes that it is not practical to
set forth in detail the potential impact federal and state regulations may have on FPI. 

The Department of Energy  

The Department of
Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91) became effective October 1, 1977.  Under this Act various agencies, including
the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) and the Federal Power Commission (FPC), have been consolidated to constitute the cabinet-level
Department of Energy (DOE).  The Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA), a semi-independent administration within the DOE,
now administers most of the regulatory programs formerly managed by the FEA, including oil pricing and allocation.  The Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent agency within the DOE, has assumed the FPC's responsibility for natural gas
regulation. 

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Price
and Allocation Regulation  

Pursuant to Executive
Order Number 12287, issued January 28, 1981, President Reagan lifted all existing federal price and allocation controls over the
sale and distribution of crude oil and natural gas liquids.  Executive Order Number 12287 was made effective as of January
28, 1981, and consequently, sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids after January 27, 1981 are free from federal regulation. 
The price for such sales and the supplier-purchaser relationship will be determined by private contract and prevailing market conditions. 
Because of this action, oil which may be sold by us will be sold at deregulated or free market prices.  At various times,
certain groups have advocated the reestablishment of regulations and control on the sale of domestic oil and gas. 

State Regulations  

FPI production of
oil and gas, if any, will be subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we may produce oil and
gas.  In general, these regulatory authorities are empowered to make and enforce regulations to prevent waste of oil and gas
and to protect correlative rights and opportunities to produce oil and gas as between owners of a common reservoir.  Some
regulatory authorities may also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production. 

Environmental Laws  

Oil and gas exploration
and development are specifically subject to existing federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental quality and
pollution control.  Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing
oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. 

All of our operations
involving the exploration for or the production of any minerals are subject to existing laws and regulations relating to exploration
procedures, safety precautions, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution of stream and fresh water sources,
odor, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as
well as the right of adjoining property owners.  We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities
data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the environment. 
All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly, time consuming, and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration
or production operations. 

It may be anticipated
that future legislation will significantly emphasize the protection of the environment, and that, as a consequence, our activities
may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection.  Such legislation, as well as future interpretation
of existing laws, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to us and delays, interruptions, or a termination
of operations, the extent to which cannot now be predicted. 

Title to Properties  

FPI owns the interest
in its properties and also at times relies on contracts with the owner or operator of the property, pursuant to which, among other
things, we have the right to have our interest placed of record.  As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary
title examination will be conducted at the time unproved properties or interests are acquired by us and prior to commencement of
drilling on unproved properties and prior to acquisition of proved properties we will conduct a full title examination and attempt
to take such further corrective steps as may be appropriate to address any material title defects that we find. 

19   

FPI properties are
subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes
and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions.  Although FPI is not aware of any material title defects
or disputes with respect to its undeveloped acreage as of the date of this filing, to the extent such defects or disputes exist,
FPI would suffer title failures which could result in material adverse consequences to the operations of the company. 

Results of Operations  

The successor entity as a result of the reverse
acquisition of Key Link is FPI, which was formed on December 17, 2015. Since this is the entity for which we are now reporting,
no operating results were available for the comparative period in 2015 since the entity had not yet been formed. 

Three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

We have not earned any revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We can provide no assurance that we will commence drilling and revenue producing operations
or that such drilling and revenue operations, if commenced, will be successful. 

Operating Expenses  

Selling,  general
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our management and personnel, and professional
fees, such as accounting, consulting and legal.  Our total selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, were $504,980. 

Other Income  

Interest income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $86. 

Net Loss  

As a
result of the foregoing, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $504,894.  

Nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

We have not earned any revenues for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We can provide no assurance that we will commence drilling and revenue producing operations
or that such drilling operations, if commenced, will be successful. 

Operating Expenses  

Selling,  general
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our management and personnel, and professional
fees, such as accounting, consulting and legal. We also incurred a non-recurring expense of $316,035 in conjunction with the purchase
of 14.1 million shares related to our reverse acquisition.  Our total selling, general and administrative expenses for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $1,365,108. 

Other Expenses  

Interest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $27,924. 

Net Loss  

As a
result of the foregoing, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $1,393,032.  

20   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As shown in the accompanying financial statements,
we incurred an accumulated loss of $1,426,488 through September 30, 2016, and have working capital of $1,533,410 at September 30,
2016. The Company is subject to those risks associated with exploration stage companies.  The Company has sustained losses
since inception and additional debt and equity financing will be required by the Company to fund its development activities and
to monetize economically recoverable oil and gas reserves. 

On June 30, 2016, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement to sell 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds totaling $2,000,000. 

Management believes that its existing cash
on hand will be sufficient to fund its operations for approximately nine (9) months. The Company also continues to search for producing
and/or additional productive properties and seeks to strategically lease additional acreage positions adjoining leases currently
owned by the Company.  There can be no assurance that the Company's efforts will be successful, or that those efforts
will translate in a beneficial manner to the Company. The accompanying statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of assets and/or liabilities that might be necessary, should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

Operating Activities  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $1,044,232 of cash in operating activities. Non-cash adjustments included $9,250
related to stock compensation expense, $17,622  related to stock payable to officers and directors, 
and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $321,928.  

Investing Activities  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $97,920 of cash in investing activities for acquisition of an oil and gas property.  

Financing Activities  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $2,400,000 of cash in financing activities, including $400,000 in proceeds
from issuance of notes and $2,000,000 in proceeds from issuance of common stock.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis of our results
of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). In accordance with GAAP, we
are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our financial statements. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On
an ongoing basis, management reviews and refines those estimates. 

Judgments are based on information including,
but not limited to, historical experience, industry trends, conventional practices, expert opinions, terms of existing agreements
and information from outside sources. Judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results
could differ from these estimates. 

Item 3.   
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS ABOUT MARKET RISK    

As a smaller reporting company, we are not
required to provide this disclosure. 

21   

Item 4.   
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the controls and procedures would meet their objectives. 

As required by SEC
Rule 13a-15(b), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.  

A material weakness
is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 2) or
combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified the following two material weaknesses
in our disclosure controls and procedures: 

1. We do
not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management evaluated the impact of our failure
to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures
and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2. We do
not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature,
segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible,
the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.
Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures
and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

To address these material
weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein
fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes in Internal
Controls  

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

22   

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.   
       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

From time to time, we may be involved in routine
legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. The ultimate
amount of liability, if any, for any claims of any type (either alone or in the aggregate) may materially and adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain.
Any outcome, whether favorable or unfavorable, may materially and adversely affect us due to legal costs and expenses, diversion
of management attention and other factors. We expense legal costs in the period incurred. We cannot assure you that additional
contingencies of a legal nature or contingencies having legal aspects will not be asserted against us in the future, and these
matters could relate to prior, current or future transactions or events. 

We are not currently a party to any material
legal proceedings. However, legal claims are inherently uncertain, and we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected
in the future by legal proceedings. 

Item 1A.   
       RISK FACTORS    

In addition
to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1,  Risk
Factors  in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 10, 2016 (the  June 8-K ), which could materially affect
our business, financial condition or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our June 8-K
are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
