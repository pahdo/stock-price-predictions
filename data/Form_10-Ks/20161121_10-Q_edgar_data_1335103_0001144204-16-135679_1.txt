1.    Description
                                         of Business and Basis of Presentation  

The Company  

Protea Biosciences Group, Inc.
(referred to herein as  Protea,   the Company,   we,   us  and  our )
is an emerging growth, molecular information company that has developed a revolutionary platform technology that enables the direct
analysis, mapping and display of biologically active molecules in living cells and tissue samples. The technology platform offers
new, unprecedented capabilities useful to the pharmaceutical, diagnostic, clinical research, agricultural and life science industries.
 Molecular information  refers to the generation and bioinformatic processing of very large data sets, known as  big
data,  obtained by applying the Company s technology to identify and characterize the proteins, metabolites, lipids
and other molecules which are the biologically active molecular products of all living cells and life forms. 

Our technology is used to improve
pharmaceutical development and life science research productivity and outcomes, and to extend and add value to other technologies
that are used in research and development, such as three-dimensional tissue models, biomarker discovery, synthetic biologicals
and mass spectrometry. In particular, the Company believes that its ability to rapidly provide comprehensive molecular image-based
datasets addresses a universal need of the pharmaceutical, diagnostic and clinical research and life science industries. 

The Company s
commercial development is centered on three lines of business: 

Molecular
                                         information services   We believe that we are the commercial leader in providing
                                         multi-modal Mass Spectrometry Imaging ( MSI ), combining Laser Ablation Electrospray
                                         Ionization ( LAESI  ), Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization ( MALDI )
                                         and optical microscopy. Our proprietary services enable the identification and quantitation
                                         of both small molecules (e.g., lipids and metabolites) and large molecules (e.g., proteins)
                                         and our services portfolio, inclusive of MSI, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and
                                         bioinformatics is unique in the industry. Our clients include major pharmaceutical, chemical
                                         and biotechnology companies;    

LAESI 
                                         instrument platform   We offer our proprietary LAESI  DP-1000 instrument, software
                                         and bioanalytical consumables to corporate   and academic research laboratories,
                                         and;    

Molecular
                                         diagnostics and clinical research   We apply our multi-modal MSI technologies and
                                         workflows in partnership with top-tier medical research institutions to co-develop new
                                         molecular diagnostic tests that the company believes can be used to improve the diagnosis
                                         and prognosis of cancer and provide requisite information useful in predicting the outcome
                                         of cancer treatment. Our current test development programs target the differential diagnosis
                                         and prognosis of malignant melanoma and the molecular profiling of subpopulations of
                                         cells in lung adenocarcinoma.    

Basis of Presentation  

The unaudited Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Protea Biosciences Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Protea Biosciences,
Inc. In the opinion of management, these statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the December 31, 2015 audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and include all material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and the elimination
of material intercompany transactions and balances, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s consolidated financial
position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. These unaudited, interim, Consolidated Financial Statements
have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly,
they do not include certain information and footnotes normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ) for complete consolidated financial statements. 

The consolidated results of
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
for the full fiscal year. These Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2016 ( 2015 Form 10-K ). 

6   

Certain amounts included in
the Company s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been
reclassified to conform to 2016 classifications. 

Emerging Growth Company  

The Company is an  emerging
growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 ( JOBS Act ) and may take advantage
of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation
and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

The Company has elected to
use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS
Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our consolidated
financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

We will remain an  emerging
growth company  for up to five years following our initial public offering, that is, until February 2019, although we will
lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year
period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30. 

To the extent that we continue
to qualify as a  smaller reporting company,  as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we
cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue
to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures, and; (3) the requirement
to provide only two years of audited financial statements instead of three years. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Information with respect to
the Company s critical accounting policies which management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company s
reported results of operations and financial condition and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex
judgements, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain, is contained
in Part II, Item 7 of our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements  

There were no changes to the
recently issued accounting pronouncements as described in the consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Form 10-K,
except as related to the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Update 2015-03,
 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU
2015-03 ). This standard update, which was issued in April 2015, requires an entity to present debt issuance costs on the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability as opposed to an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue
to be reported as interest expense. The update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods
within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016; the
adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

7   

As mentioned above, as permitted
under the JOBS Act, the Company has elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. 

Going Concern  

The Company s Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has funded its activities
to date almost exclusively from debt and equity financings as well as sales of certain assets. Substantially all of the Company s
property and equipment are security for outstanding indebtedness. We will continue to require substantial funds to support our
molecular information services business and advance global commercialization of our LAESI  instrument platform and service
outstanding debt obligations, including scheduled interest and principal payments, and fulfilling payment obligations related
to debt that has reached maturity. 

The Company has experienced
negative cash flows from operations since inception. Since inception, our operations have been funded primarily through proceeds
received from the issuance of debt and sale of equity securities in private placement offerings and, from time-to-time, sales
of certain assets. Management intends to continue to meet the Company s operating cash flow requirements by raising additional
funds from the sale of equity or debt securities, the sale of certain assets, and possibly developing corporate development partnerships
to advance our molecular information technology development activities by sharing the costs of development and commercialization.
For example, we could also enter into a transaction such as a merger with a business that is complimentary to ours. 

We have also worked closely
with various parties that financed our short- and long-term debt to obtain extensions and modifications that deferred or reduced
amounts due under these obligations. Such extensions and modifications have included, in certain cases, the issuance of warrants.
In addition, three members of the Company s Board of Directors and the estate of a former board member guarantee payment
of the Company s outstanding bank line of credit. Such extensions, modifications and guarantees have been an important part
of the Company s ability to manage its liquidity and short-term capital resources. In addition, as part of these efforts,
the Company has delayed payments to certain vendors and suppliers. As of September 30, 2016 the Company s accounts payable
balance of $1,947,739 included $1,608,934 that was overdue by terms, $1,303,710 of which that was more than 90 days past due (see
Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies for related information). Included in the $1,301,710 balance are amounts the Company owes
for rent, royalties due under certain license arrangements, legal fees and consulting. Also, as of September 30, 2016, the Company
was in an overdraft position of $233,246 with its bank. The Company has rectified the deficit position with its bank primarily
through the receipt of a cash advance from an existing stockholder (see Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders). As discussed below,
the Company was unable to repay its September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note when it matured on October 15, 2016. The Company
is also in arrears on scheduled interest and principal payments on certain other debt obligations, as discussed in more detail
in Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders and Note 12 Debt. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to continue to
obtain such extensions and modifications to outstanding debt, delay certain payments or use other methods such as guarantees by
or advances from stockholders, when and if necessary, to ensure the Company has the liquidity and capital resources necessary to
fund future operations and to continue as a going concern. 

On May 27, 2016, the Company
filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement ( Form S-1 ) with the SEC for a public offering of up to 3,100,000 shares
of the Company s Common Stock with the goal of raising $15,000,000 from such offering. The offering was part of the Company s
strategy to address its acute working capital needs, ensure it meets scheduled interest and principal payments on existing debt,
retire certain outstanding debt obligations, and, in general, provide the Company with the financial resources it needs to execute
its business objectives and expand its business. However, on August 26, 2016, the Company filed a petition with the SEC to withdraw
the Form S-1 due to market conditions. 

On September 8, 2016, the Company
entered into a note purchase agreement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ) with an  accredited investor  (as
defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) pursuant to which the investor
purchased a 10% original issue discount secured promissory note of the Company in the principal face amount of $720,000 due on
October 15, 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of $650,000 (the  September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note ).
The Company used the proceeds from such note to repay the March 2016 Short-Term Convertible Note (see Note 12 Debt for detailed
information about this note) that matured on September 4, 2016. As of the date of this report, the Company is in discussions with
the investor regarding terms to extend the maturity date of the note and such investor has acknowledged that the Company is not
currently in default under the note. See Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent events for related information. 

8   

As discussed under Note 9 Bank
Line of Credit, the Company has reclassified the outstanding balance of its bank line of credit to current liabilities as of September
30, 2016. As of that date, the outstanding balance of the line of credit was $3,000,000. This obligation has been presented as
a currently liability as the Company was in arrears with its interest at September 30, 2016. The Company has subsequently cured
the interest in arrears and the bank has not notified the Company of a default. The line of credit has a due date of July 2018. 

On September 9, 2016, the Company
reached an agreement with the holders of certain short-term convertible notes with a principal amount totaling $1,892,500 (the
 Original Principal Amount ) issued in May and June 2016 (the  Summer 2016 Notes ) whereby the Summer 2016
Notes would be exchanged for new short-term convertible notes (the  Exchange Notes ). The Exchange Notes shall have
a principal amount totaling $1,987,125 which represents the Original Principal Amount plus accrued interest of 10% per annum for
each of the Summer 2016 Notes. In addition, the notes shall extend the maturity dates under the Summer 2016 Notes to a date no
later than March 31, 2017. In addition to the Exchange Notes, the holders of the Summer 2016 Notes are exchanging their related
warrants for warrants that contain full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions. No additional changes are being made to such forms of
warrants. In October 2016, the Company reached the same such agreement with two additional holders of those certain short term
convertible notes with a principal amount totaling $91,250 issued in May and July 2016. The Exchange Notes for such additional
investors shall have a principal amount totaling $95,813 with extended maturity dates and such investors shall exchange their existing
warrants for warrants that contain full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions. As mentioned above, one element of the Company s
strategy to manage its liquidity and capital resources and otherwise continue as a going concern is to obtain extensions and modifications
to outstanding debt. 

On September 26, 2016, the Company
issued a 20% original issue unsecured convertible note in the principal face amount of $156,250 due March 26, 2017 for an aggregate
purchase price of $125,000 resulting in proceeds of $107,500 net of transaction costs. See Note 12 Debt for additional information. 

On October 31, 2016, the Company
received an advance from a related party, an officer of the Company and a Board of Director. To provide the Company with $255,000
to cover the deficit at the bank, the related party had to get a loan from the bank. The Company is responsible for repaying the
related party note directly to the bank by November 30, 2016. 

In November 2016, the Company
issued 14,927,066 shares of its Common Stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 29,854,132 shares of Common Stock resulting
in gross proceeds of $1,119,530. See Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events for additional information about the transaction. 

We have sold most our investment
in AzurRx BioPharma, Inc. ( AzurRx ) as a means of obtaining additional cash. We raised proceeds of $1,502,100 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 through sales of our ownership interest in AzurRx. As of December 31, 2015, our ownership
interest in AzurRx was 25% on a fully-diluted basis; our interest in AzurRx has been reduced to 1.7% after the most recent sale,
which was in August 2016. As of the date of this report, the Company holds 125,757 shares of AzurRx common stock, 100,000 of which
is subject to an option agreement under which a counterparty, who is the CEO of AzurRx and a former board of director of the Company,
has an option to purchase these shares from the Company for $1.00 per share from January 4, 2016 through January 4, 2021. See Note
3 Sales of Investment for additional information related to the Company s investment in AzurRx, including AzurRx completing
an initial public offering on October 11, 2016. 

Certain of the Company s
outstanding financial instruments contain anti-dilution provisions that may be triggered by the issuance of Common Stock or financial
instruments such as Preferred Stock and warrants that are convertible or otherwise exchangeable for shares of the Company s
Common Stock. As a result of the November 2016 share issuances anti-dilution provisions under certain outstanding financial instruments
have been triggered. Under such provisions the Company shall issue 49,500,832 shares of Common Stock resulting in significant dilution
to investors without such protection. See Note 5 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities   Derivative Financial Instruments
and Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events for additional information. See also Note 4 Derivative Liabilities for additional information
related to the estimated fair value of the anti-dilution provisions included in the Company s financial instruments that
were outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 

Aside from further issuances
of its Common Stock, the Company is exploring other options for obtaining additional financial resources such as the issuances
of short-term debentures and Preferred Stock. 

There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in raising enough funds to sustain operations. 

Since inception, we have been
successful in raising funds and selling certain assets to fund our operations and believe that we will be successful in obtaining
the necessary capital resources to fund our operations going forward; however, there can be no assurances that we will be able
to secure any additional funding or capital resources or the terms and conditions of any such arrangements. These factors raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going-concern. 

9   

The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

2.    Gross Revenue  

The Company recognizes revenue
from three major components: molecular information services, LAESI  instrument platform and research products. 

3.    Sales of Investment    

In the first quarter of 2016,
the Company notified AzurRx of its intent to convert 71 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock, $0.0001 par value
per share ( AzurRx Preferred Stock ), the remaining shares of AzurRx Preferred Stock held by the Company, into shares
of AzurRx common stock, $0.0001 par value per share ( AzurRx Common Stock ), pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Certificate of Designation of AzurRx. The conversion rate was 24,393.65 shares of AzurRx Common Stock per share of AzurRx
Preferred Stock. The Company received 1,731,949 shares of AzurRx Common Stock upon conversion. The Company had 100,749 shares
of Common Stock left, from the 2015 conversion and stock sales, to sale in 2016. The Company sold 1,016,941 shares of AzurRx Common
Stock during the first quarter of 2016 receiving net proceeds of $637,100. The Company sold an additional 550,000 shares during
the second quarter of 2016 receiving net proceeds of $675,000. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company sold an additional 140,000
shares of AzurRx Common Stock generating net proceeds of $190,000. 

As of September 30, 2016, the
Company s ownership interest in AzurRx included 125,757 shares of AzurRx Common Stock, which represented an ownership stake
in AzurRx of 1.7% (on a fully-diluted basis). 100,000 of these shares are subject to an option agreement under which a counterparty,
who is the CEO of AzurRx and a former board of director of the Company, has the option to purchase these shares from the Company
for $1.00 per share from January 4, 2016 through January 4, 2021. 

The Company previously accounted
for its investment in AzurRx using the  equity method.  However, considering the reduction in the Company s
interest in AzurRx during the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company discontinued the use of the  equity method 
of accounting for this investment and began accounting for the investment under the cost method (as fair market value for these
shares was not readily determinable). 

On October 11, 2016, AzurRx
completed an initial public offering ( AzurRx IPO ). As of that date, shares of AzurRx common stock are listed on
the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations ( NASDAQ ) Capital Market under the ticker symbol
 AZRX . 

4.    Derivative
                                         Liabilities  

The Company does not use derivative
instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. However, the Company has certain financial instruments
that are embedded derivatives associated with certain capital raises and common stock purchase warrants. The Company evaluates
all of its financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify
as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 815-10-05-4 and 815-40.
This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any embedded derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance
and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. If the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company,
the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise, the derivative
liability is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity. See also Note
5 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities   Derivative Financial Instruments. 

10   

5.    Fair Value
                                         of Financial Assets and Liabilities   Derivative Financial Instruments  

We measure the fair value of
financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. 

GAAP defines fair value as
the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
GAAP also establishes the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 

The three levels of inputs
used to measure fair value: 

Level
1    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

 Level
2    quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 

 Level
3    inputs that are unobservable (for example, the probability of a capital raise in a  binomial  methodology
for valuation of a derivative liability directly related to the issuance of common stock warrants) 

The Company has entered into
certain financial instruments, such as convertible debentures and equity financing arrangements, which include variable conversion
rates, include anti-dilution provisions ( down-round protection ) and detachable warrants that are: (i) not afforded
equity classification; (ii) embody risks not clearly and closely related to host contracts, or; (iii) may be net-cash settled
by the counterparty. Such derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value at the issuance date. Subsequent changes in fair value
are recorded through the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. For the Company, the Level 3 financial liability is the
derivative liabilities related to certain Common Stock and warrants that include  down-round protection  that are
valued using the  Monte Carlo Simulation  technique. While the majority of inputs are Level 2, this technique
necessarily incorporates a capital raise assumption which is unobservable and, therefore, a Level 3 input.  

As of September 30, 2016, a
range of key quantitative assumptions related to the Common Stock and warrants that include  down round protection 
are as follows: 

Financial Assets
and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  

The Company s derivative
liabilities are related to certain Common Stock issuances that included  down-round protection , warrants issued in
conjunction with certain Common Stock and debt issuances, including warrants granted to the Placement Agent related to such issuances,
that included  down-round protection , and the variable conversion rate feature of certain short-term convertible
debentures. See also Note 12 Debt, Note 13 Common Stock, and Note 15 Warrants. 

The derivative liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:    

The Company s assessment
of the probability of future capital raises is considered to be high. Such capital raise activities are estimated to take place
at levels that could possibly result in anti-dilution triggers currently at $0.075 per share, based on the November sale
of Common Shares especially considering the current market price for the Company s Common Stock (which is currently
less than $0.25 per share). The assumptions used for estimating future capital raises could be materially different from the actual
results. Any such differences could materially impact the derivative liabilities and have a materially adverse effect on the Company s
results of operations and financial condition in the near term. 

11   

As a result of the November
2016 share issuances, anti-dilution provisions under certain outstanding financial instruments have been triggered, which was
considered in the assumptions for future capital raise activity at September 30, 2016. See Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events
for additional information. 

The table below provides a
summary of the changes in fair value of the derivative liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

6.    Net Loss
                                         per Share  

Basic and diluted loss per
common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, or 133,824,867   and
133,605,888 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; for the comparative periods in 2015, weighted
average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding was 115,839,765   and 105,923,915 respectively. Common share equivalents
(which may consist of stock options, warrants and convertible debt) are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share
for all periods presented because including them would be anti-dilutive. Common share equivalents that could potentially dilute
basic earnings per share in the future, and which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share, were 98,285,387
and 86,556,934 shares as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 

7.    Inventory  

Inventory represents finished
goods and work in progress. Finished goods and work in progress consist primarily of specifically identifiable items that are
valued at the lower of cost or fair market value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory consists of the following
at: 

8.    Property
                                         and Equipment  

Property and equipment and
leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method (the Company used the double-declining
balance method for property and equipment placed in service prior to January 2011) over estimated lives as follows: 

Equipment  
      5  
    10 years   
 
      Vehicles  
      5 years   
 
      Leasehold improvements  
      Life of lease   
 
      Software  
      3 years   

12   

Property and equipment consists
of the following: 

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, depreciation expense was $177,359 and $496,487, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, depreciation expense was $176,561 and $532,366, respectively. 

9.    Bank Line
                                         of Credit  

The Company has a line of credit
with a bank that is authorized to $3,000,000. The interest rate is variable and equal to 0.75% plus prime with a minimum rate
of 5.87% per annum. The line of credit is subject to an annual review and certain covenants. Borrowings under the line are secured
by the personal guarantee of three board members and the estate of a former board member. On June 20, 2016, the Company and the
bank entered into an agreement that established July 12, 2018 as the maturity date for the outstanding balance of the line of
credit, which was $3,000,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As a result of the agreement, the outstanding
balance of the line of credit was reclassified to long-term liabilities as of the date of the agreement; previously, the  payable
upon demand  payment terms required the outstanding balance to be presented as a current liability. 

The Company s line of
credit with the bank requires the Company to adhere to certain customary covenants. For example, the bank can issue a default
notice to the Company and accelerate payment of the outstanding balance if the Company fails to make a scheduled interest payment
to the bank, is in default under any agreement with a third party which materially and adversely affects the Company s property,
operations or financial condition, or the Company does not make timely payments on property that is useful its business, including
maintenance and repairs of such property. 

As mentioned above, the Company
was not able to repay the September 2016 10% OID Promissory Note when it matured on October 15, 2016. Although the Company
is actively engaged with the lender regarding extending the maturity of the note, the Company s inability to repay the note
could be considered a default condition under the line of credit. In addition, as detailed in Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies,
the Company is significantly in arrears on rent payments to its landlord for the Company s office and laboratory space. The
Company is also significantly in arrears on certain other accounts payable, as discussed in Note 1 Description of Business and
Basis of Presentation. The Company s inability to make timely payments to certain vendors and suppliers, including its landlord,
could also be considered a default condition. Considering these factors, the Company has reclassified the balance of the line of
credit to current liabilities as of September 30, 2016. 

As of the date of this report,
the Company has made all scheduled payments to the bank and the bank has not issued any notice to the Company regarding any default
or possible default under the line of credit. 

10.    Obligations
                                         to Stockholders  

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company received advances equal to an aggregate of $235,540   from various directors and current
stockholders of the Company. The Company repaid $94,375   to three   directors during this period, which included payment
of $52,500   of the $2,574,500   in aggregate advances and other loans payable to stockholders outstanding as of December
31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of advances and other loans payable to stockholders was $2,710,220,
which included two interest-bearing promissory notes with a combined outstanding balance of $1,111,556   with two stockholders
and $1,598,664   in outstanding advances from other stockholders. The advances have no terms of repayment and do not bear
interest. 

On May 31, 2016, one of the outstanding interest-bearing promissory notes in the amount $200,000 with
a stockholder reached maturity. In June 2016, a payment was made of $12,500 to pay accrued interest through February 2016. In July
2016, a payment of $12,500 was made to cover accrued interest payable from March 2016 through June 2016 as well as $5,444 applied
against the outstanding principal balance of the note. In early August 2016, the Company and the stockholder reached a verbal agreement
to extend the maturity date to September 30, 2016, at which time the Company would make payment to the stockholder for the deferred
amount, $194,556, as well as interest accrued on the balance through September 30, 2016 of $4,864. As of the date of this report,
the Company is in discussions with the related party regarding terms to extend the maturity date of the note and such related party
has acknowledged that the Company is not currently in default under the note. 

13   

On October 31, 2016, the Company
received an advance from a related party, an officer of the Company and a Board of Director. To provide the Company with $255,000
to cover the deficit at the bank, the related party had to get a loan from the bank. The Company is responsible for repaying the
related party note directly to the bank by November 30, 2016. See Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events. 

See Note 13   Common Stock
related to the conversion of accrued interest on promissory notes issued by the Company to Summit Resources, Inc. ( Summit ),
an affiliate of Steve Antoline, a member of the Company s Board of Directors, and accounts payable by the Company to Summit,
into shares of Common Stock. 

See also Note 18 Evaluation
of Subsequent Events for activity related to advances and other loans payable to stockholders after September 30, 2016. 

11.    Other
                                         Current Liabilities  

Other current liabilities consist
of the following at: 

Short-Term Convertible Notes
Issued in Second and Third Quarters 2016 and Related Exchange Notes  

In the second quarter of 2016,
the Company issued a series of 20% original issue discount unsecured convertible debentures (the  Second Quarter 2016 Convertible
Debentures ) to 34 Accredited Investors pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Securities Purchase Agreement by between
the Company and each Accredited Investor. The face amount of the underlying debentures issued was $1,950,000 and the aggregate
gross cash proceeds to the Company were $1,560,000; each debenture has a six-month maturity from the date of issuance; maturities
for the Second Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures include $448,750, $415,000, $605,000, $481,250 in November 2016 and December
2016. In addition to the original issue discount on these debentures, which totaled $390,000, the debentures accrue additional
interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum. At the Company s option, assuming certain conditions are met, the Company can issue
shares of Common Stock in lieu of making cash interest payments. In addition, for debentures that reach maturity (i.e., they are
not converted to Common Stock), the Company has the option to pay the principal and any unpaid accrued interest in shares of Common
Stock, assuming certain conditions are met. Each debenture may be converted into Common Stock voluntarily by the holder at any
time after issuance and until the debenture is no longer outstanding. However, if the Company should complete a public offering
of Common Stock (or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) before maturity of
any of the underlying debentures, on the date of closing of such offering any outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid
interest automatically converts into shares of the Company s Common Stock at the applicable conversion rate ( Automatic
Conversion ). Each debenture is voluntarily convertible by the holder into shares of Common Stock at $0.25 per share and,
for Automatic Conversion, the conversion rate is the lower of $0.25 per share or a per share rate that is equal to 85% of the price
per share to the public of any Common Stock sold in a public stock offering (for either method of conversion, the conversion amount
being the face amount of the note plus any accrued but unpaid interest at the conversion date). The debentures sold in September
2016 (the  September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note ), which had a face amount of $156,250, were sold subject
to the Company obtaining shareholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock; as discussed in Note
18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events, the Company obtained shareholder approval for the increase in October 2016. See Note 15 Warrants
related to warrants that were granted to the investors in the Second Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures and the Placement Agent
for these debentures. 

On July 29, 2016, the Company
sold to two Accredited Investors an aggregate face amount of $63,750 of its 20% original issue discount unsecured convertible debentures
(the  July 2016 Convertible Debentures  together with the Second Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures, the  Summer
2016 Convertible Debentures ), for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $51,000, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Subscription
Agreement by and between the Company and such investors. The debentures have a term of six months from the date of issuance and
the principal amount of $63,750 bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum, payable upon conversion as described below and at maturity.
The Company may pay all or any portion accrued interest that is due in cash or, at the Company s option, in shares of Common
Stock of the Company at a conversion price of $0.25 per share, or a combination thereof; provided that the Company may pay interest
in shares only if certain conditions specified in the debenture are satisfied. The debentures are convertible, in whole or in part,
into shares of Common Stock at the option of the holder, at any time and from time to time, at a conversion price equal to the
$0.25 per share (as adjusted for forward or reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other similar proportionately-applied change). 

In addition, each of the investors
received a three-year warrant to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 75% of the shares of Common Stock initially
issuable upon conversion of the debenture, at an exercise price of $0.325 per share (as adjusted for forward or reverse stock splits,
stock dividends or other similar proportionately-applied change and subject to customary weighted-average anti-dilution price adjustment).
The relative fair value of these warrants was estimated to be $731,   which was recorded as a discount to the Summer
2016 Convertible Debentures and is being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term of the related notes. See also Note
15 Warrants. 

In connection with the issuance
of the Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures, the Company paid to a broker dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority ( FINRA ) that acted as the placement agent an aggregate of approximately $191,400   in cash compensation,
representing fees and an expense allowance. In addition, the Company agreed to issue warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately
1,409,625 shares of Common Stock to the placement agent (or its designees) with an exercise price of $0.25   per share
and a term of three (3) years. The relative fair value of these warrants was estimated to be $3,077   which was recorded
as a discount to the Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures. See also Note 15 Warrants. 

On September 9, 2016, the Company
reached an agreement with certain holders of the Second Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures pursuant to which such debentures were
exchanged for new short-term convertible notes (the  Exchange Notes ). The Exchange Notes shall have a principal amount
totaling $1,987,125 which represents the original principal amount plus accrued interest of 10% per annum for each of the Second
Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures. In addition, the Exchange Notes shall extend the maturity dates under the Second Quarter 2016
Convertible Debentures to a date no later than March 31, 2017. In addition to the Exchange Notes, the holders of the Second Quarter
2016 Convertible Debentures are exchanging their related warrants for warrants that contain full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions.
No additional changes are being made to such forms of warrants. In October 2016, the Company reached the same such agreement for
the exchange of notes and warrants with two additional holders of the Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures. 

The relative fair value of the
new warrants was estimated to be $287,792,   which was recorded as a discount to the Exchange Notes and is being accreted
to interest expense over the six-month term of the related notes. The unaccreted balance of the fair value of the warrants issued
with Second Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures was recorded as an adjustment to interest expense upon cancellation of the warrants.
See also Note 15 Warrants and Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events.

September 2016 10% OID Secured
Promissory Note     

On September 8, 2016, the Company
entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with an Accredited Investor pursuant to which the investor purchased a 10% original issue
discount secured promissory note of the Company in the principal face amount of $720,000 due October 15, 2016 for an aggregate
purchase price of $650,000 ( September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note ). The principal balance of $720,000 bears
interest at a rate of 10% per annum, payable on the October 15, 2016 maturity date. The Company used the proceeds from the offering
to repay the March 2016 Short-Term Convertible Note (see below) that matured on September 4, 2016. 

The
Company s obligations to repay and otherwise perform its obligations under the September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory
Note are secured by a continuing first priority lien and security interest in the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company
and its subsidiary, Protea Biosciences, Inc. (the  Subsidiary ) pursuant to the terms of a Security Agreement among
the Company, the Subsidiary, and the Lender (the  Security Agreement ) and include the specific assets now owned or
hereafter acquired of the Company and the Subsidiary listed on the Exhibit 1 to the Security Agreement. The Subsidiary also provided
the Lender with a full recourse guaranty for the prompt performance of all obligations of the Company, pursuant to the terms of
a guaranty agreement. 

As of the date of this
report, the Company is in discussions with the investor regarding terms to extend the maturity date of the note and such
investor has acknowledged that the Company is not currently in default under the note. If the Company is unable to
successfully negotiate an extension to the note agreement, the Accredited Investor may assert all of its rights and remedies
available under the Security Agreement and applicable law. See Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent events for
related information. 

September 2016 20% OID Note  

On
September 26, 2016, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with an Accredited Investor pursuant to which the investor
purchased a 20% original issue discount unsecured convertible debenture of the Company in the principal face amount of $156,250
due March 26, 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $125,000 (the  September 2016 20% OID Note ). The principal
balance of $156,250 bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum, payable on the March 26, 2017 maturity date. The debenture may
be converted into Common Stock by the holder at any time after issuance and until the debenture is no longer outstanding, However,
if the Company should complete a public offering of Common Stock (or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for shares of Common Stock) before maturity of any of the underlying debentures, on the date of closing of such offering any outstanding
principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest automatically converts into shares of the Company s Common Stock at the
applicable conversion rate ( Automatic Conversion ). The debenture is voluntarily convertible by the holder into shares
of Common Stock at $0.25 per share and, for Automatic Conversion, the conversion rate is the lower of $0.25 per share or a per
share rate that is equal to 85% of the price per share to the public of any Common Stock sold in a public stock offering (for
either method of conversion, the conversion amount being the face amount of the debenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest
at the conversion date). In addition, the investor received a warrant to purchase 468,750 shares of the Company s Common
Stock at an exercise price of $0.325, subject to adjustment, for a period of three years from the date thereof. The relative fair
value of these warrants was estimated to be $1,792,     which
was recorded as a discount to the September 2016 20% OID Notes and is being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term
of the notes. See also Note 15 Warrants.  

In connection with such issuance,
the Company paid to a broker dealer registered with FINRA that acted as the placement agent an aggregate of approximately $15,000
in cash compensation, representing fees and an expense allowance. In addition, the Company agreed to issue warrants to purchase
an aggregate of 109,375 shares of Common Stock to such placement agent. As of the date of this report, these warrants had not
been issued to the placement agent. However, the relative fair value of these warrants was estimated to be $239,   which
was recorded as a discount to the September 2016 20% OID Note and is being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term
of the notes. See also Note 15 Warrants.

Short-Term Convertible Note
issued in March 2016  

On March 4, 2016, the Company
issued to St. George Investments LLC ( St. George Investments ), an Accredited Investor, a 23% original issue discount
unsecured convertible note (the  March 2016 Convertible Note ) due September 4, 2016, with a principal amount
of $655,000, for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $500,000, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Securities Purchase Agreement
dated March 4, 2016 between the Company and St. George Investments. In addition to the original issue discount of $150,000, the
March 2016 Convertible Note principal amount included legal fees of St. George Investments of $5,000. In connection with the issuance
of the March 2016 Convertible Note, the Company issued to St. George Investments: (a) 108,696 shares of Company s Common
Stock (with a value of $27,174), and (b) a five-year warrant to purchase up to 1,637,500 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $0.75 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events as provided therein ( St. George Investments Warrant ).
Upon an event of default as defined in the March 2016 Convertible Note, the outstanding balance is convertible at the holder s
option into Common Stock at a conversion price equal to (initially) 70% of the lowest closing bid price for the Common Stock in
the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the conversion, subject to adjustment in certain events as provided therein. 

The relative fair value of
the St. George Investments Warrant was estimated at $12,773, which was recorded as a discount to the March 2016 Convertible Note
and accreted to interest expense over the term of the note. The relative fair value of the Common Stock issued to St. George Investments
was estimated at $27,174, which was recorded as a discount against the note and accreted over the term of the note. The Company
recognized accretion expense of $38,019   related to the fair value of these warrants, Common Stock and transaction costs
and interest expense of $51,613 related to the original issue discount during the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized accretion expense of $104,947   and interest expense of $150,000
related to this note. 

On
September 6, 2016, the March 2016 Convertible Note reached maturity and the Company paid $655,000 to St. George Investments LLC
in satisfaction of the obligation  (see also   September 2016
10% OID Secured Promissory Note   above). 

In connection with the sale
of the March 2016 Convertible Note, the Company paid to a Placement Agent an aggregate of approximately $60,000 in cash compensation,
representing fees and an expense allowance. In addition, the Company agreed to issue warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately
491,250 shares of Common Stock to the Placement Agent (or its designees) with an exercise price of $0.25 per share and a term
of three (3) years. As of the date of this report, the warrants had not been issued the Placement Agent. However, the relative
fair value of these warrants was estimated to be $2,456 ,  which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. 

See Note 15 Warrants below
related to the triggering of an anti-dilution provision included in the St. George Investments Warrant in May 2016. 

Convertible Promissory Notes
with WVJITB  

The Company has outstanding
two convertible promissory notes with the West Virginia Jobs Investment Trust Board ( WVJITB ). One is an 18-month
note issued in March 2012 with a principal amount of $290,000 ( March 2012 Promissory Note ) and the second a 3-month
note issued in April 2012 with principal amount of $400,000 ( April 2012 Promissory Note ). As of September 30, 2016,
the principal balance of the March 2012 Promissory Note was $290,000 with the principal balance of the April 2012 Promissory Note
having been reduced to $300,000 as the result of a payment made by the Company in 2013. Since the issuance of these notes, the
Company and WVJITB have enacted several addendums to both notes, including extending the maturity dates and reducing the rate
at which the notes are convertible into shares of Common Stock. Note 5 Long-term Debt in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s 2015 Form 10-K provides details regarding these addendums. 

On December 31, 2015, the Company
and WVJITB entered into an addendum whereby the maturity dates of both promissory notes were extended to March 31, 2016. In return
for the extension, in February 2016, the Company granted WVJITB a five-year warrant to purchase 590,000 shares of the Company s
Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share. Effective as of March 31, 2016, the Company and WVJITB entered into another
addendum whereby the maturity dates of both promissory notes were extended to September 30, 2016. In return for the extension,
the Company granted WVJITB another five-year warrant to purchase 590,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise
price to be determined by the Board of Directors. This addendum also granted WVJITB the option to convert $200,000 of the $300,000
outstanding principal balance of the April 2012 Promissory Notes to Common Stock at $0.50 per share at or prior to the revised
maturity date. The Company would be required to pay WVJITB the remaining (unconverted) principal balance and all accrued and unpaid
interest in cash on September 30, 2016. The warrants granted to WVJITB (the warrant granted in February 2016 and the one granted
in May 2016) expire upon the Company completing an underwritten offering that results in net cash proceeds to the Company of at
least $10.0 million, if such a transaction is completed before the end of the five-year term. Regarding the warrant granted to
WVJITB in February 2016 and May 2016, the relative fair value at the issuance date, and the corresponding liability recorded for
the warrant, was estimated at $2,478. 

16   

On October 20, 2016, the WVJITB
advised the Company that it would grant an additional extension for the maturity dates of both promissory notes. As of the date
of this report, an addendum documenting the terms and conditions of the extension has not been finalized. 

Promissory Note with WVDO  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
was eight months is arrears on scheduled principal and interest payments on an outstanding note payable to the West Virginia Development
Office ( WVDO ). The deferral amount totaled $64,278. As of the date of this report, the Company had fallen another
two month behind, or an additional $16,070. 

In October 2016, the Company and
WVDO reached a verbal agreement whereby the Company would make a payment to WVDO no later than November 30, 2016 for the deferred
amount as well as scheduled payments for October and November 2016. 

Capital Leases  

In June 2016, the Company entered
into a new four-year capital lease for three pieces of equipment that had a total estimated fair value of $549,543. The equipment
is used to generate services revenue. 

From time to time, in the normal
course of business, the Company enters into capital leases to finance equipment. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had seven
capital lease obligations outstanding with imputed interest rates ranging from 5.04% to 9.45%. The capital leases require 24  
60 monthly payments and expire in December 2016   June 2020. These leases are secured by equipment with an aggregate cost
of $1,868,809.   As of September 30, 2016, the Company was current on all capital lease payments.    

Total outstanding debt, including
capital lease obligations, are as follows (table excludes the outstanding balance of the bank line of credit as of December 31,
2015 because it was presented as a current liability at that time, as discussed in Note 9 Bank Line of Credit; table also
excludes obligations to stockholders, which are detailed in Note 10   Obligations to Stockholders and presented as a separate
line item on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets): 

(a)  West Virginia
                                         Economic Development Authority 

(b)  West Virginia
                                         Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council 

(c)  Includes convertible
notes with an outstanding balance of $1,987,125 that include anti-dilution protection 

17   

Future required minimum principal
repayments over the next five years are as follows (same exclusions as noted for the table above): 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
was authorized to issue a total of 260,000,000 shares of stock, of which 250,000,000 shares were designated common stock, par
value of $0.0001 per share with one vote in respect of each share held and no cumulative voting rights ( Common Stock ),
and 10,000,000 are designated preferred stock, par value of $0.0001 per share with one vote in respect of each share held ( Preferred
Stock ). There were no shares of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and no such shares were
issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As discussed in Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events, in October
2016, the Company s stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of stock, which included increasing
the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 500,000,000. 

On December 1, 2015, the Company s
stockholders approved a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock
split of Common Stock, within a range of no less than one-for-fifteen (1:15) and no more than one-for-twenty-five (1:25), with
such final ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion and with such reverse split to be effective
at such time and date within one year after stockholder approval (the  Reverse Split ). See Note 18 Evaluation of
Subsequent Events for additional information related to the expected ratio and timing for the Reverse Split. 

As of the date of this report,
the Company s Board of Directors had not enacted the Reverse Split and, therefore, the information presented in this report
does not include the effects of any such transaction. 

See also Note 18 Evaluation of
Subsequent Events related to the Company s sale of Common Stock in November 2016. 

Conversion of Accrued
Interest and Accounts Payable  

In February 2016, the Company s
Board of Directors authorized the conversion of an aggregate of $33,333 of accrued interest on promissory notes issued by the
Company to Summit and $8,060 of account payable (or a total of $41,393) by the Company to Summit, into 165,573 shares of Common
Stock at the rate of $0.25 per share. The transaction also included the issuance of warrants to purchase 450,000 shares of Common
Stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.40 per share, a five-year term and do not contain an anti-dilution provision.
The relative fair value of these warrants at the issuance date, and the corresponding liability recorded for these warrants at
that date, was estimated at $945. 

In September 2016, the Company s
Board of Directors authorized the conversion of an aggregate of $41,667 of accrued interest on promissory notes issued by the
Company to Summit and $9,781 of account payable (or a total of $51,448) by the Company to Summit, into 205,791 shares of Common
Stock at the rate of $0.25 per share.

Advertising Services
Agreement  

In March 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement with an advertising firm for certain services to be rendered to the Company over an estimated ninety (90) day
period (the  Media Advertising Agreement ). Besides cash compensation, the Media Advertising Agreement required the
Company to issue 150,000 shares of Common Stock to the advertising firm as of the execution date of the agreement and an additional
150,000 shares to be issued to the advertising firm thirty (30) days from the execution date of the agreement. The estimate fair
value of the shares issued in March 2016 and April 2016 was $37,500 for each issuance, which was recorded as consulting expense
in the month of issuance. 

In July 2016, the Company renewed
the agreement with such advertising firm for certain services to be rendered to the Company over an estimated ninety (90) day
period. Besides cash compensation, the Media Advertising Agreement required the Company to issue 300,000 shares of Common Stock
upon execution of the document. The fair value of the shares issued was estimated at $75,000 with the amount recorded as consulting
expense. 

(this space intentionally left blank) 

Common Stock issued and outstanding
is as follows: 

(a)  See above under  Conversion
                                         of Accrued Interest and Accounts Payable    

(b)  Shares issued in conjunction with
                                         the March 2016 Convertible Note (see Note 12 Debt)   

(c)  See above under
                                          Advertising Services Agreement  

14. Stock Options and Stock-Based Compensation     

In 2002, the Board adopted the
2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2002 Plan ) that governed equity awards to employees, members of the Board of Directors,
and consultants of the Company. Under the 2002 Plan, 450,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance. From 2006 through
2012, the 2002 Plan was amended several times to increase the total number of shares authorized under this plan to 4,150,000 shares.
In 2013, the Board of Directors adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2013 Plan ) and, together with the 2002
Plan (the  Plans ), governs the equity awards to employees, members of the Board of Directors, and consultants of
the Company. Under the 2013 Plan, an additional 12,500,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance. 

19   

The types of awards permitted under
the Plans include qualified incentive stock options ( ISO ), non-qualified stock options ( NQO ), and
restricted stock. Each stock option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of
Directors may specify. Stock options generally vest over four (4) years and expire no later than ten (10) years from the date
of grant. A summary of stock option activity is as follows: 

(this space intentionally left blank) 

The following table summarizes
information about stock options at September 30, 2016: 

As
of September 30, 2016, the total aggregate intrinsic value for stock options currently exercisable and stock options outstanding
was estimated to be $0.    This value represents the total
pre-tax, intrinsic value based on the estimated fair value of the Company s Common Stock price of $0.12 per share   as
of September 30, 2016.  

The following table summarizes
the activity of the Company s stock options that have not yet vested: 

20   

The fair value of non-vested stock
options to be recognized in future periods is $674,803, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.72
years. The total fair value of stock options vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $175,304   compared
to $207,971 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Stock-based compensation expense
is as follows: 

The
weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $0.095
per stock option    and for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 it was $0.31 per stock option.   

The fair value of the stock option
grants was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

The Company utilizes a peer group
to estimate its expected volatility assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company completed an analysis
and identified four similar public companies considering their industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. Given
the Company s limited history with stock options, the Company s expected term is based on an average of the contractual
term and the vesting period of the options (the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110,  Simplified  method). 

In connection with the issuance
of the Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures and the September 2016 20% OID Note (see Note 12 Debt above), the Company granted each
investor a three-year warrant to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.325 per share,
as adjusted for forward or reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other similar proportionately-applied change and subject to
customary weighted-average anti-dilution price adjustment. The total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
these warrants is 6,510,000. The relative fair value of these warrants was estimated at $28,202, which was recorded as a discount
to these debentures and is being accreted over the term of the underlying debentures. As noted below, a majority of the warrants
issued in conjunction with the Summer Convertible Debentures are being cancelled in exchange for new warrants.  

On September 9, 2016, the Company
reached an agreement with holders of certain short-term convertible notes issued in May and June 2016, the Second Quarter 2016
Convertible Debentures, to exchange existing notes with new short-term convertible notes (the  Exchange Notes ). In
addition to the Exchange Notes, such holders are exchanging their existing warrants for warrants that contain full-ratchet anti-dilution
provisions. No additional changes are being made to such forms of warrants. The relative fair value of the new warrants was estimated
at $233,345, which was recorded as a discount to the New Notes and is being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term
of these notes. Related to the exchange transaction, the Placement Agent also exchanged their warrants for warrants that contain
full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions. No additional changes are being made to such forms of warrants. The relative fair value
of the new warrants issued to the Placement Agent was estimated at $54,447, which was also recorded as a discount to the Exchange
Notes and is also being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term of the related notes. See also Note 18 Evaluation
of Subsequent Events for information related to the acceptance of the Company s exchange offer by two additional investors
in October 2016. 

21   

The St. George Investments Warrant
(see Note 12 Debt above for additional information related to this warrant and the related short-term convertible note) included
an anti-dilution provision that required the Company to reduce the exercise price for the warrant for any subsequent issuances
of Common Stock, or any instrument or securities that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock, if the effective
price for any such issuance was at an effective price per share that was less than the exercise price for the St. George Investments
Warrant. Such a triggering event occurred upon issuance of the first of the Second and Third Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures,
each of which are convertible into shares of the Company s Common Stock at $0.25 per share. Effective May 20, 2016, the
exercise price of the St. George Investment Warrant was reduced to $0.25 per share thereby increasing the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant to 4,912,500 shares from 1,637,500 shares (the adjustment was capped by a
provision in the warrant agreement that limits any anti-dilution adjustment to three times the original number of shares issuable
upon exercise of the warrant). The relative fair value of the adjustment was estimated to be $6,879, which was recorded as an
additional discount to the March 2016 Convertible Debenture and was accreted over the remaining term of the obligation. As discussed
above in Note 12 Debt, this debenture matured on September 6, 2016. The Company recognized accretion expense of $104,947 related
to the adjustment. 

See Note 12   Debt and Note
13 Common Stock for information related to the issuance of warrants to Summit, WVJITB, and a placement agent for the purchase
of 450,000, 1,180,000, and 2,010,250 shares of Common Stock, respectively during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Note,
the amount of warrants issued to the placement agent are net of warrants cancelled in September 2016. 

See also Note 18   Evaluation
of Subsequent Events for information related to warrants issued in conjunction with the Company s sale of Common Stock in
early November 2016. In addition, see Note 18   Evaluation of Subsequent Events for information related to the triggering
of certain anti-dilution provisions included in certain of the Company s outstanding financial instruments, including the
reduction of the exercise price for certain warrants. 

As of September 30, 2016, warrants
to purchase 82,946,270 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and exercisable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company recognized a total of $49,894 in interest expense resulting from the accretion of the fair value of issued warrants.

                                         and Contingencies  

Legal Proceedings  

The Company currently is not a
party to any material legal proceeding and has no knowledge of any material legal proceeding contemplated by any governmental
authority or third party. The Company may be subject to a number of claims and legal proceedings which, in the opinion of our
management, are incidental to normal business operations. In management s opinion, although final settlement of these claims
and suits may impact the financial statements in a particular period, they will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

As of the date of this report,
the Company had received three court summons for past due accounts payables. The claims total $213,032   and are related
to amounts the Company has properly accounted for in its accounting records, including late-payment fees and interest, if applicable.
As discussed in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, the Company has delayed payment to certain suppliers
and vendors as part of its efforts to manage its liquidity and short-term capital resources. 

Agreement with Landlord  

On November 4, 2016, the Company
reached an agreement with the landlord for its Morgantown, West Virginia facility for payment of past-due rent. The agreement
stipulates that the Company will pay the amount due as of October 31, 2016, $90,801, in four installments from November 4, 2016
through December 16, 2016. The Company has paid the first two installments, as scheduled. If the Company fails to make either
of final two payments, as scheduled, the landlord may take legal action against the Company, which could include seizing possession
the Company s office and laboratory space. 

Warranty Reserve  

The Company provides for a one-year
warranty with the sale of its LAESI  instruments. As the Company does not currently have sufficient historical data on warranty
claims, the Company s estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs are primarily based on comparable industry
metrics. The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating
the quality of its products. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued warranty expense of
$54,293 and $50,000, respectively. 

University License Agreements  

The Company has agreements with
West Virginia University ( WVU ) and George Washington University (GWU) related to in-licensed technologies as follows: 

WVU  The Company has entered into a
                                         License and Exclusive Option to License Agreement with the West Virginia University Research
                                         Corporation ( WVURC ), a nonprofit West Virginia corporation acting for and
                                         on behalf of WVU. Under the terms of this agreement, the WVURC has granted the Company
                                         an exclusive option to license technology from the laboratories of certain WVU principal
                                         investigators in the field of protein discovery, for therapeutic, diagnostic and all
                                         other commercial fields worldwide. Under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays
                                         expenses for the preparation, filing and prosecution of related patent applications,
                                         and the Company will pay royalties on the net revenue resulting from the sale of products
                                         and services that utilize the WVU subject technology.   

23   

GWU    I  n
March 2009, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with GWU for technology developed
in the laboratory of Dr. Akos Vertes Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Biochemistry   Molecular Biology, Founder
and Co-Director of the W.M. Keck Institute for Proteomics Technology and Applications, the Department of Chemistry, who is a science
advisor to the Company. The technology field is laser ablation electrospray ionization, or  LAESI , a new method of
bioanalytical analysis that enables high throughput biomolecule characterization. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company
has the exclusive, worldwide rights to commercialize the technology. The Company has obtained a registered trademark for  LAESI  .
The Company is obligated to pay expenses for the preparation, filing and prosecution of related patent applications, and the Company
pays royalties on the net revenues resulting from the sale of products and services that utilize the GWU subject technology. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded royalty expenses of $4,765 and $20,299, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded royalty expenses of $10,934 and $31,145, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company s accounts payable balance included $118,046 payable to GWU, of which $79,292 was past
due, for royalties on sales of the LAESI  instrument platform. Under the terms of the Company s Exclusive License Agreement
with GWU, as amended, the Company is required to pay interest on amounts that are more than five (5) business days overdue. In
addition, the Company s agreement with GWU allows GWU to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including related
to late payments. As of the date of this report, GWU has not taken any such action.       

In November 2012, the Company
entered into a Patent License Agreement with GWU for technology developed in the laboratory of Akos Vertes Ph.D. The technology
field is Laser Desorption/Ionization and Peptide Sequencing on Laser-Induced Silicon Microcolumn Arrays ( LISMA )
and Nanophotonic Production, Modulation and Switching of Ions by Silicon Microcolumn Arrays (Nanophotonic arrays, or  NAPA ).
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company has an exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer for
sale and sell the licensed products. The Company is obligated to pay a license initiation fee of $25,000 and a minimum license
diligence resources of $12,500 in year two and $20,000 each year thereafter to develop and commercialize the products, $30,000
milestone payment upon the first sale of a licensed product, and royalties will be 7% of the net sales of licensed products and
5% of the net sales of combination products for combined cumulative net sales up to $50 million. Thereafter, royalties reduce
to 6% and 4%, respectively, after taking into account quarterly minimum royalties of $1,500 for the first four quarters after
the first sale of a licensed product, $2,500 for the next four quarters, $3,500 for the next four quarters and $6,000 for each
succeeding quarter. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded royalty expenses of $2,500
and $5,500, respectively, related to sales of REDIchip . As of September 30, 2016, the Company s accounts payable
balance includes $8,500 payable to GWU, of which $6,000 was past due, related to this agreement. Similar to the Company s
agreement with GWU related to LAESI , the Company s agreement with GWU for LISMA/NAPA allows GWU to terminate the agreement
under certain circumstances, including related to late payments. As of the date of this report, GWU has not taken any such action. 

In January 2014, the Company became
a subcontractor to GWU in a multi-year project with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) to develop
new tools and methods to elucidate the mechanism of action of a threat agent, drug, biologic or chemical on living cells within
thirty (30) days of exposure. We have commercialized a NAPA-based product out of this arrangement that is currently being sold
to research laboratories performing small molecule analysis.   This product is called REDIchip  (an acronym for Resonance-Enhanced
Desorption Ionization). 

COAST Project   

In 2014, the Company entered
into an agreement with Omics2Image B.V. ( O2I ) related to the  Next Generation Ambient Imaging Mass Spectrometry
for (Bio)polymers and Smart Materials  (the  COAST Project ). As part of this arrangement, the Company agreed
to commit  60,000 (approximately $76,000 at that time) to the COAST Project and O2I agreed to evenly share the value gained
from the efforts as outlined within the scope of the project, which may include new intellectual property and the development
of a commercial, integrated instrument system. The Company s remaining obligation on this arrangement is $24,500, an amount
that was due by agreement in 2014.

Obligations to Stockholders  

Subsequent to September 30,
2016, the Company received an advance from a related party, an officer of the Company and a Board of Director. To provide the Company
with $255,000 to cover the deficit at the bank, the related party had to get a loan from the bank. The Company is responsible for
repaying the related party note directly to the bank by November 30, 2016. 

Subsequent to September 30,
2016, the Company received other advances totaling $83,000 from certain current directors and related parties and repaid $9,164
to certain related parties. As with advances from stockholder as of September 30, 2016, the advances from stockholders from October
1, 2016 through the date of this report have no terms of repayment and do not bear interest. As of the date of this report, the
outstanding balance of the Company s obligations to stockholders was $3,039,056. See Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders
for additional information. 

Increase in Authorized Shares
of Common Stock  

On October 21, 2016, the Company s
stockholders voted in favor of an increase in the Company s authorized capitalization from 250,000,000 shares of Common
Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Authorized Common Stock Increase ). On October 24, 2016,
the Company filed the necessary Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State
to effectuate the change. 

Sale of Common Stock  

At an initial closing held on
November 3, 2016 (the  Closing ), the Company received an aggregate of $631,680 in gross cash proceeds from 25 accredited
investors (the  Purchasers ) in connection with the sale of approximately 63 units of securities (each a  Unit 
and collectively, the  Units ) pursuant to the terms and conditions of Subscription Agreements (the  Subscription
Agreements ) by and among the Company and each of the Purchasers. 

On November 18, 2016 (the  Closing ),
the Company received an aggregate of $487,850 in gross cash proceeds from 11 accredited investors (the  Purchasers )
in connection with the sale of approximately 48.79 units of securities (each a  Unit  and collectively, the  Units )
pursuant to the terms and conditions of Subscription Agreements (the  Subscription Agreements ) by and among the Company
and each of the Purchasers. 

Pursuant to its private placement
memorandum, dated as of October 31, 2016 (the  Memorandum ), the Company is offering, through a placement agent, a
maximum of 500 Units of securities at a price of $10,000 per Unit for up to $5,000,000 in gross proceeds (the  Offering ).
Each Unit consists of up to (a) 133,333.33 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 (the  Common Stock ), (b) 18
month warrants to purchase 133,333.33 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.09 per share (the  Class A Warrants ),
and (c) five year warrants to purchase 133,333.33 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.1125 per share (the  Class
B Warrants  and together with the Class A Warrants, the  Investor Warrants ). If all 500 Units are sold, the
Company will issue an aggregate of 66,666,667 shares of its Common Stock and Investor Warrants to purchase up to 133,333,334 shares
of Common Stock. The Offering will terminate on December 31, 2016 unless the Company and the Placement Agent mutually agree to
extend the Offering to as late at March 31, 2017. 

The Company intends to consummate
a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of its outstanding Common Stock following the termination date of the Offering, which reverse split
has previously been authorized by the Company s stockholders. Consummation of the Reverse Stock Split will require (a) the
filing of an amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State, and (b) obtaining
the approval of FINRA. 

25   

In connection with the Closings,
the Company paid to the placement agent an aggregate of $152,384 in cash compensation, representing fees and an expense allowance.
In addition, the Company agreed to issue a warrant to the placement agent to purchase an aggregate of 4,231,120 shares of Common
Stock, with an exercise price of $0.09 per share and term of three years. The Company also issued one Unit to the placement agent s
legal counsel for services rendered in connection with the Closing. 

In connection with the Closing,
the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ) with each of the
Purchasers, which requires the Company to file a registration statement (the  Registration Statement ) with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) registering for resale (i) all Common Stock issued to the Purchasers as
part of the Units, (ii) all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants and the warrants issued to
the placement agent, and (iii) all shares of Common Stock issued to legal counsel for services rendered in connection with the
Closing. 

If the Registration Statement is
not declared effective by the SEC within the specified deadlines set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company
will be required to pay to each Purchaser an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages, equal to 1.0% of the aggregate purchase
price paid by such Purchaser per 30-day period that such failure continues, up to the maximum of 6% of the aggregate Purchase
Price. If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages in full within seven days after the date payable, the Company
will pay interest thereon at a rate of 18% per annum. 

The forms of the Subscription
Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Class A Warrant, the Class B Warrant and the warrant issued to the placement
agent are filed as Exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2016, and the foregoing summaries
of the terms of such documents are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the full text of such documents, which are incorporated
herein by reference. 

Exchange of Summer 2016 Convertible
Debentures  

In October 2016, the Company
reached an agreement with two additional holders of the Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures pursuant to which such debentures will
be exchanged for new short-term convertible notes (the  Exchange Notes ). The Exchange Notes shall have a principal
amount totaling $95,813 which represents the original principal amount plus accrued interest of 10% per annum for each of the two
investors in the Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures. In addition, the Exchange Notes shall extend the maturity dates under the
Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures to a date not later than March 31, 2017. In addition to the Exchange Notes, such holders are
exchanging their related warrants for warrants that contain full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions. No additional changes are being
made to such forms of warrants. The relative fair value of the new warrants are estimated to be $13,876,   which will
be recorded as a discount to the Exchange Notes and is being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term of the related
notes. The unaccreted balance of the fair value of the warrants issued with Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures was recorded as
an adjustment to interest expense upon cancellation of the warrants. See Note 12 Debt and Note 15 Warrants for related information. 

Anti-Dilution Triggering
Event  

The sale of Common Stock in
November 2016 (see above) was completed at a unit price of $0.075 per share, which triggered the anti-dilution provisions contained
in certain outstanding financial instruments. As a result, to satisfy the Company s obligations under such provisions, the
Company expects to issue 49,500,832 shares of Common Stock, issue 25,244,336 Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, reduce
the conversion rate for the Exchange Notes to $0.075 per share (See Note 12 Debt) and reduce the exercise price of 49,459,532
warrants. 

Agreement with Landlord  

On November 4, 2016, the Company
reached an agreement with the landlord for its Morgantown, West Virginia facility for payment of past-due rent. The agreement stipulates
that the Company will pay the amount due as of October 31, 2016, $90,801, in four installments from November 4, 2016 through December
16, 2016. The Company has paid the first two installments, as scheduled. If the Company fails to make either of final two payments,
as scheduled, the landlord may take legal action against the Company, which could include seizing possession the Company s
office and laboratory space. 

September 2016
10% OID Secured Promissory Note  

On September 8, 2016, the Company
entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with an Accredited Investor pursuant to which the investor purchased a 10% original issue
discount secured promissory note of the Company in the principal face amount of $720,000 due October 15, 2016 for an aggregate
purchase price of $650,000 ( September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note ). The principal balance of $720,000 bears
interest at a rate of 10% per annum, and was payable on the October 15, 2016 maturity date. 

The
Company s obligations to repay and otherwise perform its obligations under the September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory
Note are secured by a continuing first priority lien and security interest in the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company
and its subsidiary, Protea Biosciences, Inc. (the  Subsidiary ) pursuant to the terms of a Security Agreement among
the Company, the Subsidiary, and the Lender (the  Security Agreement ) and include the specific assets now owned or
hereafter acquired of the Company and the Subsidiary listed on the Exhibit 1 to the Security Agreement. The Subsidiary also provided
the Lender with a full recourse guaranty for the prompt performance of all obligations of the Company, pursuant to the terms of
a guaranty agreement. 

As of the date of this report,
the Company is in discussions with the investor regarding terms to extend the maturity date of the note and such investor has
acknowledged that the Company is not currently in default under the note. If the Company is unable to successfully negotiate an
extension to the note agreement, the Accredited Investor may assert all of its rights and remedies available under the Security
Agreement and applicable law.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following section pertains to activity
included in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, which are contained in Part I, Item
1 of this report. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

The Company recorded a net loss of $5,518,191
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This result is an increase of $3,211,150 versus the $2,307,041 net loss recorded
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change reflects a $3,194,447 increase in the Company s estimate of the
fair value of the anti-dilutive provisions included in certain of the Company s outstanding financial instruments. See Note
5 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities   Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. Other quarter-over-quarter
changes include an increase in interest expense of $299,433 and an increase in gains resulting from the sale of AzurRx stock of
$190,000. 

Gross revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016 increased by 23% over the gross revenue recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue from molecular
information services increased by 119%. The more than doubling of this revenue component reflects increases in both the number
of customers for whom we performed services and the number of services projects completed in the quarter. Molecular information
service customers include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and medical device companies. 

We recorded revenue from the sale of one LAESI 
device in the three months ended September 30, 2015; however, we did not sell any of these devices during the three months ended
September 30, 2016. As a result, revenue from this component decreased by 97% quarter-over-quarter. We believe the lack of a sale
in the recently completed quarter is more reflective of the onerous terms certain suppliers have placed on Protea considering
our current financial position (e.g., requiring payment for parts in advance) and long-lead times for certain components than
the underlying market demand for the equipment. Customers for our LAESI  instrument platform mirror those for molecular information
services. 

Revenue from research products increased by
4%. The increase reflects an increase in revenue from the sales of research products partially offset by a decrease in revenue
from sales of the Company s REDIchip  product. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
versus the three months ended September 30, 2015, cost of revenue as presented in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive
Loss increased by $259,021 or 123% primarily as a result of the Company implementing a new methodology to estimate cost of revenue
for molecular information services during the three months ended June 30, 2016. 

Selling, general and administrative ( SG A )
expenses recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $51,490   or 3% less than the SG A expenses
recorded during the comparable period in 2015. The change reflects both the Company s adoption of a new methodology to estimate
cost of revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2016, as noted above, and efforts to reduce personnel costs, outside services,
consulting expenses, and other activity recorded as SG A expenses, in particular during the first nine months of 2015. 

27   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, research and development expenses decreased 68% primarily due to a decrease
in costs associated with the development of the LAESI  instrument platform and Nanopost Array ( NAPA ) technologies
(the latter includes the Company s REDIchip  product). Both of these products are now considered commercial products.
In addition, funding for certain expenses incurred by the Company in support of its ongoing participation in the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) program referred to as the Rapid Threat Assessment program is recorded in this
line item. The funding was $15,693   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus $35,410   for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The amount and timing of future expenses and expense recovery related to our participation in
this program are difficult to forecast considering the research and development nature of the collaboration. 

The gains on sales of investment of $190,000
recorded during the third quarter of 2016 reflects the sale of 140,000 shares of AzurRx Common Stock. The gain reflects proceeds
resulting from the sale of the shares less transaction costs as the basis for the Company s AzurRx investment had previously
been reduced to $0. As discussed below, the Company also sold shares of AzurRX Common Stock in the first and second quarters of
2016. See also Note 3   Sales of Investment and Note 17 Evaluation of Subsequent Events in Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company s investment in AzurRx. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
interest expense increased 45% versus the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting both an overall increase in outstanding
debt and the interest rates, debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with those obligations (i.e., the amortization
of debt issuance costs and accretion of original issue discount to interest expense over the term of the underlying obligation).
As of September 30, 2016, total interest-bearing indebtedness was $10,035,294   versus $9,086,166   as of September
30, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, interest-bearing indebtedness was $7,166,752. As discussed below under Liquidity and Capital
Resources, the Company issued a series of short-term convertible notes in May   September 2016. See also Note 9 Bank Line
of Credit, Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders, Note 12 Debt, and Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events in Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company s short
and long-term debt and advances and loans from stockholders. 

The Company recorded an expense of $3,240,442
for the net increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2016. These derivative
liabilities are certain anti-dilution provisions contained in various financial instruments issued by the Company, in particular
convertible notes and warrants. There have been no changes in the assumptions underlying the calculation of estimated fair value
of these liabilities in 2016, except for a decrease in the estimated unit price at which a future capital raise is modeled, now
$0.075 per share of Common Stock. The amount recorded in this line item for the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflects
an increase in the estimated fair value of anti-dilution provisions contained in certain of the Company s outstanding financial
instruments. Detailed information regarding the fair value of these liabilities, including the assumptions used to estimate the
fair value of these liabilities, can be found in Note 5 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities   Derivative Financial
Instruments in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

The Company did not recognize a provision
for income taxes for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or for the comparable periods in 2015. The Company has
evaluated its income tax position in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 740, Income Taxes, and determined that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset was appropriate as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the two balance sheet dates included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this report.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $31,526,892 million   with a full, offsetting valuation
allowance. Net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards totaled approximately $80,838,184   million   as of
September 30, 2016. These NOLs begin to expire in 2021 for both federal and state income tax purposes. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

The Company recorded a net loss for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 of $8,411,332. This result is an increase of $831,886 over the net loss of $7,579,446 recorded
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is due primarily to an increase in the estimated fair value of the
anti-dilutive provisions included in certain of the Company s outstanding financial instruments of $3,085,082 and an increase
in interest expense of $332,166, offset by an increase in revenues of $305,717, a decrease in total operating expenses of $739,041
(cost of revenue, SG A and R D expenses) and gains recorded totaling $1,502,100 resulting from the Company s sales
of AzurRx Common Stock. 

Gross revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 increased by 24% over the gross revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue from molecular
information services increased by 95%. The increase reflects increases in both the number of customers for whom we performed services
and the number of services projects completed in the period. 

28   

We recorded revenue from the sale of two LAESI 
devices in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. However, we sold only one of these devices in the nine months ended September
30, 2016. As a result, the revenues from this component decreased 59% versus the comparable period in 2015. As noted above, we
believe the lack of a sale in the recently completed quarter is more reflective of the onerous terms certain suppliers have placed
on Protea than the underlying market demand for these devices. 

Revenue from research products increased by
4%. This increase primarily reflects an increase in revenue from sales of the Company s REDIchip  product partially
offset by decreases in sales of consumables. 

SG A expenses recognized
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,441,855, which was 16% less than the SG A expenses recorded for the
comparable period in 2015. The change reflects both the Company s adoption of a new methodology to estimate cost of revenue
for molecular information services during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 as detailed above, and efforts
to reduce personnel costs, outside services, consulting expenses, and other activity recorded as SG A expenses, in particular
during the first nine months of 2015. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, R D expenses decreased 53% primarily due to a decrease in costs associated
with the development of the LAESI  instrument platform and NAPA technologies. As mentioned above, both of these products are
now considered commercial products. In addition, funding for certain expenses incurred by the Company in support of its ongoing
participation in the DARPA program referred to as the Rapid Threat Assessment program is recorded in this line item. The funding
was $101,808 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $107,461   for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

The gains from sales of investment of $1,502,100
recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the sale of   1,706,941   shares of AzurRx Common
Stock, including 1,016,941, 550,000 and 140,000 shares in the first, second and third quarter of 2016, respectively. The gains
are equivalent to the proceeds resulting from the sales of the shares less transaction costs as the basis for the Company s
AzurRx investment had previously been reduced to $0. See also Note 3 Sales of Investment in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company s investment in AzurRx. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
interest expense increased 29% versus the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting both an overall increase in outstanding
debt and the interest expense associated with those obligations, including the amortization of issuance costs and accretion of
original-issue-discount and the fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with certain debt issuances. See related discussion
above under  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.  See also Note
9 Bank Line of Credit, Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders, Note 12 Debt, and Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events in Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company s
debt. Although there were no debt conversion inducement costs recognized in the first nine months of 2016 the Company recognized
debt conversion inducement costs of $60,419 in the comparable period in 2015 for the fair value of warrants issued to Summit Resources,
Inc. ( Summit ) related to the conversion of certain amounts due to Summit into Common Stock. 

For the change in fair value of derivative
liabilities, see the related discussion above under  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2015.  

As detailed above under  Three Months Ended
September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015,  the Company did not recognize a provision for income
taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the comparable period in 2015. 

Going Concern  

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements
have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. As detailed below, the Company requires
additional financial resources to continue its operations.   If we cannot obtain additional financial resources through additional
debt and equity financings or the sale of assets, we may be forced to further curtail our operations or consider other strategic
alternatives, which would likely result in substantially dilution of our current stockholders. Even if we are successful in raising
additional financial resources, there can be no assurance regarding the timing or terms of any such transaction. 

29   

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The following section pertains to activity
included in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, both of which are contained
in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s
current assets totaled $556,276,   current liabilities $17,401,793, and working capital was a deficit of $16,845,517. 
 As of December 31, 2015, current assets totaled $411,591,   current liabilities $9,590,170,   and working capital
was a deficit of $9,178,579. Current assets increased as accounts receivable, net, increased due primarily to an increase in sales
for September 2016 as compared to December 2015 and the Company held a higher investment in inventory related to an increase in
sales activity. The 81% increase in current liabilities is due primarily to increase in short-term convertible notes in the second
and third quarter of 2016, a bank overdraft, an increase in accounts payables, and an increase in the liability established for
the fair value of derivative liabilities. As discussed in Note 9 Bank Line of Credit in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the Company reclassified the outstanding balance of the line of credit to current
liabilities as of September 30, 2016. 

As detailed in Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders
and Note 12 Debt in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the Company continues
to have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding that is payable within twelve months. In May 2016   September 2016,
the Company issued short-term notes that require payments at maturity totaling $2,982,964; these notes had six-month terms and
originally matured in November 2016   March 2017. As discussed in additional detail in Note 12 Debt in Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, a majority of these notes were exchanged for notes that resulted
in the maturity dates for the obligations being extended to March 2017. The exception was a note issued in September 2016 referred
to as the September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note for which the maturity date was October 15, 2016. As discussed in additional
detail in Note 12 Debt in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the Company
is in discussions with the investor regarding terms to extend the maturity date of the note and such investor has acknowledged
that the Company is not currently in default under the note. As of the date of this report through March 31, 2017, scheduled interest
and principal payments on outstanding debt (including capital leases) and payments related to debt obligations reaching maturity,
total $7,687,178, excluding the balance of the line of credit, which the Company has reclassified as a current liability, but for
which, by terms, does not mature until July 2018. As discussed under  Cash Requirements  below, the Company is in arrears
on certain scheduled interest and principal payments on outstanding debt and has deferred payments to certain vendors and suppliers
past stated terms. The Company also expects cash flows from operating activities to be a deficit during this period putting an
additional burden on the Company to raise additional financial resources in order to meet its obligations and otherwise sustain
operations. 

Net cash used in operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $3,408,885, which represents a decrease of $909,416 or 21% from the net cash used
in operating activities of $4,318,301 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The largest factors for the improvement
include a lower overall cost structure in 2016 and delaying payment of certain accounts payable and other current liabilities (see
related discussion below under  Cash Requirements ). 

Net cash provided by investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1,479,227, which represents the net proceeds from the sale of AzurRx Common
Stock received during the period and proceeds from sale of equipment. Net cash used by investing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was $79,286, which is the net amount resulting from the sales and purchases of certain equipment. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,923,301, which represents a decrease of $2,026,392 or 51% from the net cash
provided by financing activities of $3,949,693 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The first nine months of 2016 included
net proceeds from the issuance of debt to third parties of $2,528,281 with net proceeds from the issuance of debt to third parties
of $1,690,656 during the comparable period in 2015. However, net activity involving stockholder advances and debt was $1,269,280
higher during the first nine months of 2015. In addition, the first nine months of 2015 included proceeds of $575,042 and $720,938
from the sale of preferred stock and common stock, respectively. Additional information regarding the Company s issuance
of debt to third parties during the first nine months of 2016 can be found in Note 12 Debt in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Additional information regarding activity involving stockholder advances and debt
can be found in Note 10 Obligation to Stockholders in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1
of this report. As discussed below, the Company requires additional capital resources to fund future operations, service outstanding
debt, and continue as a going concern. 

30   

Cash Requirements  

The Company s Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has funded its activities
to date almost exclusively from debt and equity financings as well as sales of certain assets. Substantially all of the Company s
property and equipment are security for outstanding indebtedness. We will continue to require substantial funds to support our
molecular information services business and advance global commercialization of our LAESI  instrument platform and service
outstanding debt obligations, including scheduled interest and principal payments, and fulfilling payment obligations related
to debt that has reached maturity. 

The Company has experienced negative cash
flows from operations since inception. Since inception, our operations have been funded primarily through proceeds received from
the issuance of debt and sale of equity securities in private placement offerings and, from time-to-time, sales of certain assets.
Management intends to continue to meet the Company s operating cash flow requirements by raising additional funds from the
sale of equity or debt securities, the sale of certain assets, and possibly developing corporate development partnerships to advance
our molecular information technology development activities by sharing the costs of development and commercialization. For example,
we could also enter into a transaction such as a merger with a business that is complimentary to ours. 

We have also worked closely with various
parties that financed our short- and long-term debt to obtain extensions and modifications that deferred or reduced amounts due
under these obligations. Such extensions and modifications have included, in certain cases, the issuance of warrants. In addition,
three members of the Company s Board of Directors and the estate of a former board member guarantee payment of the Company s
outstanding bank line of credit. Such extensions, modifications and guarantees have been an important part of the Company s
ability to manage its liquidity and short-term capital resources. In addition, as part of these efforts, the Company has delayed
payments to certain vendors and suppliers as of September 30, 2016 the Company s accounts payable balance of $1,947,739
included $1,608,934 that was overdue by terms, which includes $1,303,710 that was more than 90 days past due (see Note 16 Commitments
and Contingencies included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for related information). Also, as of September 30, 2016, the Company
was in an overdraft position with its bank; the amount of the overdraft was $233,246. The Company has rectified the deficit position
with its bank primarily from borrowing from an existing stockholder (see Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders included in Part I,
Item 1 of this report). As discussed below, the Company was unable to repay its September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note
when it matured on October 15, 2016. The Company is also in arrears on scheduled interest and principal payments on certain other
debt obligations, as discussed in more detail in Note 10 Obligations to Stockholders and Note 12 Debt, both of which are included
in Part I, Item 1 of this report. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to continue to obtain such extensions
and modifications to outstanding debt, delay certain payments or use other methods such as guarantees by or advances from stockholders,
when and if necessary, to ensure the Company has the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund future operations and to
continue as a going concern. 

On May 27, 2016, the Company filed a Form
S-1 Registration Statement ( Form S-1 ) with the SEC with the goal of raising $15,000,000 from the sale of shares
of the Company s Common Stock. The filing was part of the Company s strategy to address its acute working capital
needs, ensure it meets scheduled interest and principal payments on existing debt, retire certain outstanding debt obligations,
and, in general, provide the Company with the financial resources it needs to execute its business objectives. However, on August
26, 2016, the Company filed a petition with the SEC to withdraw the Form S-1 due to market conditions. 

On September 8, 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement with an  accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
or  Accredited Investor ) pursuant to which the Accredited Investor purchased a 10% original issue discount secured
promissory note of the Company in the face amount of $720,000 due on October 15, 2016 (the  September 2016 10% OID Secured
Promissory Note ). The Company used the proceeds from the offering to repay the March 2016 Short-Term Convertible Note (see
Note 12 Debt included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for detailed information about this note) that matured on September 4,
2016. As mentioned above, the Company was unable to repay the September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note when it matured on
October 15, 2016. The Company is currently negotiating with the Accredited Investor to extend the maturity date for this note;
however, the Company currently does not have the financial resources to pay the investor the full maturity value of the note.
If the Company is unable to successfully negotiate an extension to the note agreement, the Accredited Investor may assert all of its rights and remedies available under the Security Agreement and applicable law. 

31   

On September 9, 2016, the Company offered
investors in its Second Quarter 2016 Convertible Debentures (see Note 12 Debt for detailed information about these debentures)
the option to exchange those debentures and accompanying warrants for debentures and accompanying warrants (which are referred
to hereafter as the  Exchange Notes ) that would, in effect, extend the maturity dates for these obligations until
March 2017 (the exact maturity date being six months from the day each investor accepted the Company s exchange offer).
The new debentures would also accrue interest at 10.0% per annum. The rate at which the new debentures could be converted into
Common Stock and the exercise prices for the accompanying warrants would be unchanged from the debentures being exchanged and
the warrants originally issued with these debentures, which would be cancelled; however, both the new debentures and accompanying
warrants include protection against the Company issuing future dilutive financial instruments (i.e.,  anti-dilution provisions ).
The offer would permit the exchange of the face amount of the original debentures, which includes original issue discount, plus
accrued interest on the debentures in an amount that would have been payable to an investor had the obligation been outstanding
through the original maturity date, for the new debentures. See Note 12 Debt included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional
information regarding the Exchange Notes, including conversion terms and conditions. In September 2016, 33 of the 36 investors
in the Second and Third Quarter Convertible Debentures accepted the Company s offer resulting in payments totaling $410,813
and $1,576,313 (including accrued interest) due in November 2016 and December 2016, respectively, being deferred until March 2017.
In October 2016, two additional investors accepted the Company s offer resulting in payments totaling $60,375 and $35,438
 ( including accrued interest) due in November 2016 and January 2017, respectively, being deferred until March 2017 and April
2017, respectively. As mentioned above, one element of the Company s strategy to manage its liquidity and capital resources
and otherwise continue as a going concern is to obtain extensions and modifications to outstanding debt. 

In November 2016, the Company sold Common
Stock and accompanying warrants resulting in gross proceeds of $1,119,530; the Company received $925,646 after transaction costs.
See Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information about the
transaction. 

We have sold most our investment in AzurRx
BioPharma, Inc. ( AzurRx ) as a means of obtaining additional cash. We raised proceeds of $1,502,100 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 through sales of our ownership interest in AzurRx. As of December 31, 2015, our ownership interest
in AzurRx was 25% on a fully-diluted basis; our interest in AzurRx has been reduced to 1.7% after the most recent sale, which
was in August 2016. As of the date of this report, the Company holds 125,757 shares of AzurRx common stock, 100,000 of which is
subject to an agreement under which the counterparty can purchase these shares from the Company for $1.00 per share. See Note
3   Sales of Investment included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information related to the Company s
investment in AzurRx, including AzurRx completing an initial public offering on October 11, 2016. 

Certain
of the Company s outstanding financial instruments contain anti-dilution provisions that may be triggered by the issuance
of Common Stock or financial instruments such as Preferred Stock and warrants that are convertible or otherwise exchangeable for
shares of the Company s Common Stock. As detailed in Note 18   Evaluation of Subsequent Events included in Part I,
Item 1 of this report, the Company s sale of Common Stock in early November 2016 triggered anti-dilution provisions included
in certain outstanding financial instruments and resulted in substantial dilution to the Company s existing investors that
did not have such protection. See also Note 4 Derivative Liabilities included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional
information related to the estimated fair value of the anti-dilution provisions included in the Company s financial instruments
that were outstanding as of September 30, 2016.   

The
Company continues to explore its alternatives as far as obtaining additional financial resources.   
Since inception, we have been successful in raising funds and selling certain assets to fund our operations and believe that we
will be successful in obtaining the necessary capital resources to fund our operations going forward; however, there can be no
assurances that we will be able to secure any additional funding or capital resources or the terms and conditions of any such
arrangements. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going-concern.   

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements
do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company continues to have an immediate
need for additional working capital to sustain its current level of operations. Based on our current projections, management estimates
that the Company will need in approximately $8.5   $10  million in additional working capital to maintain the current
level of operations, meet scheduled interest and principal payments on outstanding debt, and meet payment obligations related to
debt reaching maturity, for the next twelve calendar months. This projection has increased from the previous quarter 10-Q to reflect
the reclassification of the Bank Line of Credit from long-term to short-term as previously mentioned in Note 12 Debt. As discussed
above, the Company has recently raised additional funds through the issuance of convertible promissory notes and Common Stock;
however, the Company must raise additional capital resources to sustain operations and meet existing obligations. There can be
no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to extend the terms of the September 2016 10% OID Secured Note and raising
the additional capital needed to sustain operations and continue as a going concern. 

32   

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements
do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet guarantees,
interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded
contracts. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

policies see Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk .   

As a  smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures .

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules, regulations and related forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 30, 2016, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer on the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded as a result of material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2016. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to the following material weaknesses of our internal
control over financial reporting, which are common to many small companies: (1) lack of sufficient personnel commensurate with
the Company s reporting requirements; (2) the Company did not consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities
in pursuit of the Company s financial reporting objectives; and (3) insufficient written documentation or training of internal
control policies and procedures which provide staff with guidance or framework for accounting and disclosing financial transactions. 

Despite the existence of the material weaknesses
above, we believe that the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-Q fairly present our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all material respects. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There have been no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal controls. 

33   

PART II   OTHER
INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings .   

From time to time, we may become involved
in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. 

There are presently no pending legal proceedings
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject that we believe will have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. As far
as we are aware, no governmental authority is contemplating any such proceeding. 

Legal Proceedings  

The Company currently is not a party to
any material legal proceeding and has no knowledge of any material legal proceeding contemplated by any governmental authority
or third party. The Company may be subject to a number of claims and legal proceedings which, in the opinion of our management,
are incidental to normal business operations. In management s opinion, although final settlement of these claims and suits
may impact the financial statements in a particular period, they will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

As of the date of this report, the Company
had received three court summons for past due accounts payables. The claims total $213,032 and are related to amounts the Company
has properly accounted for in its accounting records, including late-payment fees and interest, if applicable. As discussed in
Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, the Company has delayed payment to certain suppliers and vendors as
part of its efforts to manage its liquidity and short-term capital resources. 

Agreement with Landlord  

On November 4, 2016, the Company reached
an agreement with the landlord for its Morgantown, West Virginia facility for payment of past-due rent. The agreement stipulates
that the Company will pay the amount due as of October 31, 2016, $90,801, in four installments from November 4, 2016 through December
16, 2016. The Company has paid the first two installments, as scheduled. If the Company fails to make either of final two payments,
as scheduled, the landlord may take legal action against the Company, which could include seizing possession the Company s
office and laboratory space. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors .   

There are no material changes from the risk
factors previously disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Item 2.  Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds .   

Other than as reported in our Current Reports
on Form 8-K filed with the SEC, and as set forth below, we have not sold any of our equity securities during the period covered
by this Report. 

Advertising Services Agreement  

In March 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement with an advertising firm for certain services to be rendered to the Company over an estimated ninety (90) day period
(the  Media Advertising Agreement ). Besides cash compensation, the Media Advertising Agreement required the Company
to issue 150,000 shares of Common Stock to the advertising firm as of the execution date of the agreement and an additional 150,000
shares to be issued to the advertising firm thirty (30) days from the execution date of the agreement. In July 2016, the Company
renewed the agreement with such advertising firm for certain services to be rendered to the Company over an estimated ninety (90)
day period. Besides cash compensation, the Media Advertising Agreement required the Company to issue 300,000 shares of Common Stock
upon execution of the document. The fair value of the shares issued was estimated at $75,000 with the amount recorded as consulting
expense. 

Summer 2016 Exchange Notes   Warrants  

On September 9, 2016, the Company offered
investors in its Summer 2016 Convertible Debentures (see Note 12 Debt for detailed information about these debentures) the option
to exchange those debentures and accompanying warrants for debentures and accompanying warrants (which are referred to hereafter
as the  Exchange Notes ) that would, in effect, extend the maturity dates for these obligations until March 2017 (the
exact maturity date being six months from the day each investor accepted the Company s exchange offer). The Exchange Notes
would also accrue interest at 10.0% per annum. The rate at which the Exchange Notes could be converted into Common Stock and the
exercise prices for the accompanying warrants would be unchanged from the debentures being exchanged and the warrants originally
issued with these debentures, which would be cancelled; however, both the new debentures and accompanying warrants include protection
against the Company issuing future dilutive financial instruments (i.e.,  anti-dilution provisions ). The offer would
permit the exchange of the face amount of the original debentures, which includes original issue discount, plus accrued interest
on the debentures in an amount that would have been payable to an investor had the obligation been outstanding through the original
maturity date, for the new debentures. See Note 12 Debt included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding
the Exchange Notes, including conversion terms and conditions. In September 2016, 33 of the 36   investors in the Summer
2016 Convertible Debentures accepted the Company s offer resulting in payments totaling $410,813 and $1,576,313 (including
accrued interest) due in November 2016 and December 2016, respectively, being deferred until March 2017. In October 2016, two
additional investors accepted the Company s offer resulting in payments totaling $60,375 and $35,438  ( including accrued
interest) due in November 2016 and January 2017, respectively, being deferred until April 2017, respectively. As mentioned
above, one element of the Company s strategy to manage its liquidity and capital resources and otherwise continue as a going
concern is to obtain extensions and modifications to outstanding debt. 

September 2016 Bridge Debentures  

On September 26, 2016, the Company entered
into a Subscription Agreement with an Accredited Investor pursuant to which the investor purchased a 20% original issue discount
unsecured convertible debenture of the Company in the principal face amount of $156,250 due March 26, 2017 for an aggregate purchase
price of $125,000 (the  September 2016 20% OID Note ). The principal balance of $156,250 bears interest at a rate of
10% per annum, payable on the March 26, 2017 maturity date. The debenture may be converted into Common Stock by the holder at any
time after issuance and until the debenture is no longer outstanding, However, if the Company should complete a public offering
of Common Stock (or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) before maturity of
any of the underlying debentures, on the date of closing of such offering any outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid
interest automatically converts into shares of the Company s Common Stock at the applicable conversion rate ( Automatic
Conversion ). The debenture is voluntarily convertible by the holder into shares of Common Stock at $0.25 per share and,
for Automatic Conversion, the conversion rate is the lower of $0.25 per share or a per share rate that is equal to 85% of the price
per share to the public of any Common Stock sold in a public stock offering (for either method of conversion, the conversion amount
being the face amount of the debenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest at the conversion date). In addition, the investor
received a warrant to purchase 468,750 shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.325, subject to adjustment,
for a period of three years from the date thereof. The relative fair value of these warrants was estimated to be $1,792,   which
was recorded as a discount to the September 2016 20% OID Notes and is being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term
of the notes. 

In connection with such issuance, the Company
paid to a broker dealer registered with FINRA that acted as the placement agent an aggregate of approximately $15,000 in cash compensation,
representing fees and an expense allowance. In addition, the Company agreed to issue warrants to purchase an aggregate of 109,375
shares of Common Stock to such placement agent. As of the date of this report, these warrants had not been issued to the placement
agent. However, the relative fair value of these warrants was estimated to be $239, which was recorded as a discount to the September
2016 20% OID Note and is being accreted to interest expense over the six-month term of the notes. 

Anti-Dilution Triggering Event  

The sale of Common Stock in November 2016
by the Company was completed at a unit price of $0.075 per share (See Note 18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events), which triggered
the anti-dilution provisions contained in certain outstanding financial instruments. As a result, to satisfy the Company s
obligations under such provisions, the Company expects to issue 49,500,832 shares of Common Stock, reduce the conversion rate for
the Exchange Notes to $0.075 per share (see Note 12 Debt) and reduce the exercise price of 33,273,337 warrants. See Part I, Note
18 Evaluation of Subsequent Events for further information. 

The securities described above were
issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. In determining that the issuance of the securities qualified for an exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of
the Securities Act, the Company relied on the following facts:(i) the recipients were either accredited investors or sophisticated
investors as defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act who had access to information about the Company that
was generally the same as information required to be delivered in a registered offering; and (ii) the Company did not use any form
of general solicitation or advertising to offer the securities issued.  

Item 3.  Defaults
upon Senior Securities .    

September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory
Note  

On September 8, 2016, the Company entered
into a Note Purchase Agreement with an Accredited Investor pursuant to which the investor purchased a 10% original issue discount
secured promissory note of the Company in the principal face amount of $720,000 due October 15, 2016 for an aggregate purchase
price of $650,000 ( September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note ). The principal balance of $720,000 bears interest
at a rate of 10% per annum, and was payable on the October 15, 2016 maturity date. 

The Company s
obligations to repay and otherwise perform its obligations under the September 2016 10% OID Secured Promissory Note are secured
by a continuing first priority lien and security interest in the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company and its subsidiary,
Protea Biosciences, Inc. (the  Subsidiary ) pursuant to the terms of a Security Agreement among the Company, the Subsidiary,
and the Lender (the  Security Agreement ) and include the specific assets now owned or hereafter acquired of the Company
and the Subsidiary listed on the Exhibit 1 to the Security Agreement. The Subsidiary also provided the Lender with a full recourse
guaranty for the prompt performance of all obligations of the Company, pursuant to the terms of a guaranty agreement. 

As of the date of this report, the Company
is in discussions with the investor regarding terms to extend the maturity date of the note and such investor has acknowledged
that the Company is not currently in default under the note. If the Company is unable to successfully negotiate an extension to
the note agreement, the Accredited Investor may assert all of its rights and remedies available under the Security Agreement and
applicable law.

 To Investors in 20% OID Debentures
and Warrants 

 of Protea Biosciences Group, Inc. 

Dear Investor: 

In May, June, and July 2016, Protea
Biosciences Group, Inc. ( Protea  or the  Company ) sold to you and certain other accredited investors
an aggregate of $2,013,750 principal amount of 20% original issue discount unsecured short-term convertible debentures due November
20, 2016, November 30, 2016, December 10, 2016 December 30, 2016, and January 29, 2016, being six months following their respective
dates of issuance (collectively, the  Existing Debentures ). In addition, we issued to you and the other purchasers
of the Existing Debentures three-year warrants to purchase up to 6,041,250 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise
price of $0.325 per share (the  Existing Warrants ). 

The Company plans on offering in
the same private placement to accredited investors up to $3,500,000 of additional 20% original issue discount unsecured short-term
convertible debentures due six months following their respective dates of issuance (the  New Debentures ) and warrants
to purchase at an exercise price of $0.325 per share, a number of shares of Company common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the
 Common Stock ) equal to 75% of the number of shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the New
Debentures (the  New Warrants ). Laidlaw   Company (UK) Limited will act as placement agent for the offering of
the New Debentures and New Warrants (the  Offering ); such Offering to continue until October 31, 2016, subject to
extension of such offering period to as late as November 30, 2016. 

The New Debentures and New Warrants
being offered pursuant to Protea s Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, dated August 31, 2016 (the  Memorandum )
are substantially identical to the Existing Debentures and Existing Warrants (collectively, the  Existing Securities ).
However, the Existing Securities contain weighted average anti-dilution adjustment provisions, whereas, the New Debentures and
New Warrants now being offered contain full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions which, in substance entitles the holder to reduce
his or its conversion price and exercise price then in effect to any lower price in which the Company sells Common Stock or other
convertible securities or warrants (with limited exceptions). 

We are pleased to advise you that
the Company has agreed to offer to you and all of the other holders of the Existing Securities an opportunity to exchange such
Existing Securities for the New Debentures and New Warrants. So you can make an informed investment decision, we are enclosing
with this letter a copy of the Protea Memorandum which includes as exhibits the form of New Debenture and New Warrant. 

In addition, on September 7, 2016,
the Company received $655,000 from the issuance to one investor of a $725,000 principal amount promissory note; the proceeds of
which were used to retire a $655,000 note issued in March 2016 that matured on September 7, 2016 (the  Refinancing Note ).
The Refinancing Note is due and payable on October 15, 2016 and is secured by a lien on the Company s accounts receivable
and inventory. The Company is requesting that you consent to the issuance of the Refinancing Note and agree to waive any default
that may have occurred under your Existing Debenture by reason of the issuance of the Refinancing Note. 

If you elect to accept this exchange
offer and consent to the Company s issuance of the Refinancing Note, please so indicate by executing a copy of this letter
in the space provided below. If you elect to exchange your Existing Securities for the New Debenture and New Warrant, please return
your Existing Debenture and Existing Warrant to us, and we will arrange with the Company to cancel such Existing Securities and
have Protea send to you a New Debenture in identical principal amount and a New Warrant. 

Very truly yours,

I.            SUBSCRIPTION
FOR SECURITIES AND REPRESENTATIONS BY SUBSCRIBER

conference whose attendees were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising. 

1.9     The
Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Offering has not been reviewed by the SEC nor any state regulatory authority since the

or  blue sky  laws and agrees not to sell, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer or dispose of the Securities unless
they are registered under the Securities Act and under any applicable state securities or  blue sky  laws or unless
an exemption from such registration is available. 

1.10   The
Subscriber understands that the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a claimed exemption under
the provisions of the Securities Act that depends, in part, upon the Subscriber s investment intention and investment qualification.
In this connection, the Subscriber hereby represents that the Subscriber is purchasing the Securities for the Subscriber s
own account for investment and not with a view toward the resale or distribution to others; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall constitute an agreement by the Subscriber to hold the Securities for any particular length of time and the Company

1.11   The
Subscriber consents to the placement of a legend on any certificate or other document evidencing the Securities and, when issued,
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures (the  Conversion Shares ) and exercise of the
Warrant (the  Warrant Shares  and collectively with the Conversion Shares, the  Shares ) that such securities
have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or  blue sky  laws and setting forth or referring
to the restrictions on transferability and sale thereof contained in this Agreement. The Subscriber is aware that the Company will
make a notation in its appropriate records with respect to the restrictions on the transferability of such Securities or the Shares. 

1.12   The
Subscriber hereby represents that the address of the Subscriber furnished by Subscriber on the signature page hereof is the Subscriber s
principal residence if Subscriber is an individual or its principal business address if it is a corporation or other entity. 

3   

1.13   Such
Subscriber understands that the Securities are  restricted securities  and have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any applicable state securities law and is acquiring the Securities as principal for its own account and not with a view
to or for distributing or reselling such Securities or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities law, has no present intention of distributing any of such Securities in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
state securities law and has no direct or indirect arrangement or understandings with any other persons to distribute or regarding
the distribution of such Securities in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law. Furthermore, such
Subscriber is not purchasing the Securities as a result of any advertisement, article, notice or other communication regarding
the Securities published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or presented at any
seminar or any other general solicitation or general advertisement. 

1.14   The
Subscriber represents that the Subscriber has full power and authority (corporate, statutory and otherwise) to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to purchase the Securities. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Subscriber,
enforceable against the Subscriber in accordance with its terms. 

1.15   If
the Subscriber is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan, individual retirement account,
Keogh Plan, or other tax-exempt entity, it is authorized and qualified to invest in the Company and the person signing this Agreement
on behalf of such entity has been duly authorized by such entity to do so. 

1.16   The
Subscriber acknowledges that if he or she is a Registered Representative of a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA )
member firm, he or she must give such firm the notice required by the FINRA s Rules of Fair Practice, receipt of which must
be acknowledged by such firm in Section 7.4 below. 

1.17   To
effectuate the terms and provisions hereof, the Subscriber hereby appoints the Placement Agent as its attorney-in-fact (and the
Placement Agent hereby accepts such appointment) for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Escrow Agreement by and
between the Company, the Placement Agent and Escrow Agent (the  Escrow Agreement ) including, without limitation, taking
any action on behalf of, or at the instruction of, the Subscriber and executing any release notices required under the Escrow Agreement
and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Placement Agent may deem necessary or advisable (and lawful) to accomplish
the purposes hereof. All acts done under the foregoing authorization are hereby ratified and approved and neither the Placement
Agent nor any designee nor agent thereof shall be liable for any acts of commission or omission, for any error of judgment, for
any mistake of fact or law except for acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This power of attorney, being coupled with
an interest, is irrevocable while the Escrow Agreement remains in effect. 

1.18   The
Subscriber agrees not to issue any public statement with respect to the Subscriber s investment or proposed investment in
the Company or the terms of any agreement or covenant between them and the Company without the Company s prior written consent,
except such disclosures as may be required under applicable law or under any applicable order, rule or regulation. 

1.19   The
Subscriber understands, acknowledges and agrees with the Company that this subscription may be rejected, in whole or in part, by
the Company, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, at any time before any Closing notwithstanding prior receipt by
the Subscriber of notice of acceptance of the Subscriber s subscription. 

4   

1.20   The
Subscriber acknowledges that the information contained in the Transaction Documents or otherwise made available to the Subscriber
is confidential and non-public and agrees that all such information shall be kept in confidence by the Subscriber and neither used
by the Subscriber for the Subscriber s personal benefit (other than in connection with this subscription) nor disclosed to
any third party for any reason, notwithstanding that a Subscriber s subscription may not be accepted by the Company; provided,
however, that (a) the Subscriber may disclose such information to its affiliates and advisors who may have a need for such information
in connection with providing advice to the Subscriber with respect to its investment in the Company so long as such affiliates
and advisors have an obligation of confidentiality, and (b) this obligation shall not apply to any such information that (i) is
part of the public knowledge or literature and readily accessible at the date hereof, (ii) becomes part of the public knowledge
or literature and readily accessible by publication (except as a result of a breach of this provision) or (iii) is received from
third parties without an obligation of confidentiality (except third parties who disclose such information in violation of any
confidentiality agreements or obligations, including, without limitation, any subscription or other similar agreement entered into
with the Company). 

1.21   The
Subscriber will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Placement Agent and, where applicable, their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors, affiliates and shareholders, and each other person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing
(collectively, the  Issuer Indemnified Parties ) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all fees, costs and expenses whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any claim, lawsuit, administrative proceeding or investigation whether commenced or threatened)
(a  Loss ) arising out of or based upon any representation or warranty of the Subscriber contained herein or in any
document furnished by the Subscriber to the Company and/or the Placement Agent in connection herewith being untrue in any material
respect or any breach or failure by the Subscriber to comply with any covenant or agreement made by the Subscriber herein or therein;
and if for any reason (other than a final non-appealable judgment finding any Issuer Indemnified Party liable for losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses for its gross negligence or willful misconduct) the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to an Issuer
Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Issuer Indemnified Party harmless, then the Subscriber shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by an Issuer Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Company or the Placement agent, as applicable, on the
one hand and the Subscriber on the other, but also the relative fault of the Issuer or the Placement Agent, as applicable, on the
one hand and the Subscriber on the other, as well as any relevant equitable considerations;  provided ,  however , that
the Subscriber shall not be liable to indemnify any Issuer Indemnified Parties under this Section or to contribute to the amount
paid or payable by all Issuer Indemnified Parties under this Section in an amount under both such provisions that in the aggregate
exceeds the Subscriber s aggregate purchase price tendered hereunder.

5.1      Transfer
Restrictions.  

(a)          The
Securities may only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws. In connection with any transfer of Securities
other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, to the Company or
to an affiliate of a Subscriber or in connection with, the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company
an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred
Securities under the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement, and shall have the rights of a Subscriber under this Agreement. 

14   

(b)          The
Subscriber agrees to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 5.1, of a legend on any of the Securities, including
the Shares, substantially in the following form: 

[NEITHER] THIS SECURITY [NOR THE SECURITIES
INTO WHICH THIS SECURITY IS [EXERCISABLE] [CONVERTIBLE]] HAS [NOT] BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE  SECURITIES ACT ), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL
TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY. THIS SECURITY [AND THE
SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON [EXERCISE] [CONVERSION] OF THIS SECURITY] MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT
OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES. 

(c)           The
Subscriber understands that prior to September 2, 2011, the Company was a  shell company  as defined in Rule 12b-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ). Pursuant to Rule 144(i), securities issued
by a current or former shell company (that is, the Securities and the Shares) that otherwise meet the holding period and other
requirements of Rule 144 nevertheless cannot be sold in reliance on Rule 144 unless at the time of a proposed sale pursuant to
Rule 144 the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has filed all reports
and other materials required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months
(or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports. As a
result, the restrictive legends on certificates for the Securities or the Shares cannot be removed except in connection with an
actual sale meeting the foregoing requirements or pursuant to an effective registration statement.  

(d)          Certificates
evidencing the Shares shall not contain any legend (including the legend set forth in Section 4.1(b) hereof): (i) while a registration
statement covering the resale of such security is effective under the Securities Act, or (ii) following any sale of such Shares
pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) if such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial
interpretations and pronouncements issued by the staff of the SEC). The Company shall cause its counsel, at the Company s
expense, to issue a legal opinion to the Company s transfer agent promptly (but in no event later than the requisite share
delivery date set forth in the Debentures and the Warrants) if required by the Company s transfer to effect the removal of
the legend hereunder. 

5.2      Listing
of Securities . The Company agrees, (i) if the Company applies to have the Common Stock traded on any other trading market,
it will include in such application the shares of Common Stock and Shares, and will take such other action as is necessary or desirable
to cause the shares of Common Stock and Shares to be listed on such other trading market as promptly as possible, and (ii) it will
take all action reasonably necessary to continue the listing and trading of its Common Stock on a trading market and will comply
in all material respects with the Company s reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the trading
market. 

15   

5.3      Reservation
of Shares . Subject to Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 5.12 of this Agreement), , at all times while the Debentures
and Warrants are outstanding, maintain a reserve from its duly authorized shares of Common Stock of a number of shares of Common
Stock sufficient to allow for the issuance of the Shares. 

5.4      Replacement
of Securities . If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Securities or the Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and
substitution therefor, a new certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company
of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new certificate
or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs associated with the issuance of such replacement
securities. If a replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any securities is requested due to a mutilation thereof, the
Company may require delivery of such mutilated certificate or instrument as a condition precedent to any issuance of a replacement. 

5.5      Furnishing
of Information . Until the time that no Subscriber owns Securities, the Company covenants to maintain the registration of the
Common Stock under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file
within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange
Act. As long as Subscriber owns Securities, if the Company is not required to file reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, it will
prepare and furnish to Subscriber and make publicly available in accordance with Rule 144(c) such information as is required for
the Subscribers to sell the Securities under Rule 144. The Company further covenants that it will take such further action as any
holder of Securities may reasonably request, to the extent required from time to time to enable such person to sell such Securities
without registration under the Securities Act within the requirements of the exemption provided by Rule 144. 

5.6      Securities
Laws; Publicity . Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Company shall, by 8:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth
trading day immediately following the first and last Closings hereunder, issue a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the material
terms of the transactions contemplated hereby and including the Transaction Documents as exhibits thereto to the extent required
by law. The Company shall not publicly disclose the name of Subscriber, or include the name of any Subscriber in any filing with
the SEC or any regulatory agency or trading market, without the prior written consent of Subscriber, except: (a) as required by
federal securities law in connection with the filing of final Transaction Documents (including signature pages thereto) with the
SEC and (b) to the extent such disclosure is required by law, in which case the Company shall provide the Subscriber with prior
notice of such disclosure permitted under this clause (b). 

5.7      Form
D; Blue Sky Filings . The Company agrees to timely file a Form D with respect to the Securities as required under Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act and to provide a copy thereof, promptly upon request of the Subscriber. The Company shall
take such action as the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for, or to qualify the
Securities for, sale to the Subscriber at the Closing under applicable securities or  Blue Sky  laws of the states
of the United States, and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly upon request of any Subscriber. 

5.8      Equal
Treatment of Subscribers . No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction Document) shall be offered or paid
to any person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of any of the Transaction Documents unless the same
consideration is also offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents. 

16   

5.9           Indemnification.   

(a)     The
Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Subscriber, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents and controlling persons (collectively, the  Subscriber Indemnified Parties ) from and against any and all loss,
liability, damage or deficiency suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of any misrepresentation or breach of warranty
by the Company or, after any applicable notice and/or cure periods, nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement to be performed
or complied with by the Company, in each case contained in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents; and will promptly
reimburse the Subscriber Indemnified Parties for all expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) as incurred
in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim related to or arising in
any manner out of any of the foregoing, or any action or proceeding arising therefrom (collectively,  Proceedings ),
whether or not such Subscriber Indemnified Party is a formal party to any such Proceeding. 

(b)    If
for any reason (other than a final non-appealable judgment finding any Subscriber Indemnified Party liable for losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses for its gross negligence or willful misconduct) the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to an Subscriber
Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Subscriber Indemnified Party harmless, then the Company shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by a Subscriber Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Subscriber on the other,
but also the relative fault of the Company or the Placement Agent, as applicable, on the one hand and the Subscriber on the other,
as well as any relevant equitable considerations. 

(c)     Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall not be liable to indemnify any Subscriber Indemnified Parties under Section 5.9(a) or to contribute
to the amount paid or payable by all Subscriber Indemnified Parties under Section 5.9(b) in an amount under both such Sections
that in the aggregate exceeds the Subscriber s aggregate purchase price tendered hereunder. 

5.10       Non-Public
Information . Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
the Company covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any other person acting on its behalf, will provide Subscriber or its agents
or counsel with any information that the Company believes constitutes material non-public information, unless prior thereto Subscriber
shall have executed a written agreement regarding the confidentiality and use of such information. The Company understands and
confirms that Subscriber shall be relying on the foregoing covenant in effecting transactions in securities of the Company. 

5.11       Use
of Proceeds . Except as set forth on  Schedule 5.11  attached hereto, the Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale
of the Securities hereunder for working capital purposes and shall not use such proceeds for: (a) the satisfaction of any portion
of the Company s debt (other than payment of trade payables in the ordinary course of the Company s business and prior
practices), (b) the redemption of any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents or (c) the settlement of any outstanding litigation. 

5.12        Stockholder
Approval  .  The Company has filed a proxy statement with the SEC on August 22, 2016 and it shall use its best
efforts to increase its authorized shares of Common Stock from 250,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the  Charter
Amendment ) or, if, for any reason, such Charter Amendment is not able to be filed, to consummate a 1-for-15 reverse stock
split of its outstanding Common Stock, which reverse stock split was approved on December 1, 2015 by the requisite majority of
Company stockholders and the Company s board of directors was authorized to effect such reverse stock split at a ratio determined
by them within a range of between 1-for-15 and 1-for-25 (the  Authorized Reverse Stock Split ), on or before October
31, 2016, as may be required to issue all of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of, or otherwise with
respect to, the Debentures and the Warrants in accordance with Delaware law and any applicable rules or regulations of the Trading
Market (the  Stockholder Approval ).   The Company shall comply with the filing and disclosure requirements
of Section 14 under the Exchange Act in connection with the Stockholder Approval.  The Company represents and warrants
that its Board of Directors has approved the proposal contemplated by this Section.

to be charged, and this Agreement may not be discharged except by performance in accordance with its terms or by a writing signed
by the party to be charged. No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision,
condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair
the exercise of any such right. 

6.3     This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and to their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns. The Company may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of Subscriber (other than by merger). Subscriber may assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement to any person

Transaction Documents, together with the exhibits and schedules thereto, contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters,
which the parties acknowledge have been merged into such documents, exhibits and schedules.

or its respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state
and federal courts sitting in the City of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the

conditions and provisions or portions thereof shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and enforceable to the extent
they are valid, legal and enforceable, and no provisions shall be deemed dependent upon any other covenant or provision unless
so expressed herein. 

6.9     It
is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate, or be construed, as a
waiver of any subsequent breach by that same party.

as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

constitute one and the same instrument. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery
of a  .pdf  format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or
on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or  .pdf  signature
page were an original thereof.

in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any rights in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement. 

6.13   In
addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, the Subscriber
and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under this Agreement. The parties agree that monetary damages may not

6.14  
 Acknowledgment Regarding Subscriber s Trading Activity . The Company further understands and acknowledges that (a)
Subscriber may engage in hedging activities at various times during the period that the Securities are outstanding, including,
without limitation, during the periods that the value of the Shares deliverable with respect to Securities are being determined,

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS  

The USA PATRIOT Act   
       
       What is money laundering?   
       
       How big is the problem and why   
  is it important?    

The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to detect, deter, and punish terrorists in the United States and abroad.  The Act imposes new anti-money laundering requirements on brokerage firms and financial institutions.  Since April 24, 2002 all brokerage firms have been required to have new, comprehensive anti-money laundering programs. To help you understand these efforts, we want to provide you with some information about money laundering and our steps to implement the USA PATRIOT Act.  
       
      Money laundering is the process of disguising illegally obtained money so that the funds appear to come from legitimate sources or activities.  Money laundering occurs in connection with a wide variety of crimes, including illegal arms sales, drug trafficking, robbery, fraud, racketeering, and terrorism.  
       
      The use of the U.S. financial system by criminals to facilitate terrorism or other crimes could well taint our financial markets.  According to the U.S. State Department, one recent estimate puts the amount of worldwide money laundering activity at $1 trillion a year.   

What are we required to do to eliminate money laundering?    

Under new rules required by the USA PATRIOT Act, our anti-money laundering program must designate a special compliance officer, set up employee training, conduct independent audits, and establish policies and procedures to detect and report suspicious transaction and ensure compliance with the new laws.  
       
      As part of our required program, we may ask you to provide various identification documents or other information.  Until you provide the information or documents we need, we may not be able to effect any transactions for you.

shares of Common Stock are actually issued to the Holder, (ii) the notice of Conversion delivered by the Holder to Company affirms
that the issuance of the Conversion Shares on account of principal and interest will not violate Section 4(c) hereunder. To the
extent that any such issuance of Conversion Shares on account of the principal amount under this Section 2(b) would violate Section
4(c), such principal amount shall be paid in cash. In the event that the Company shall elect to pay all or any part of the principal
amount in Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder shall be determined by dividing (i) the Principal
Share Amount, by (ii) the Conversion Price then in effect.

Conversion . At any time after the Original Issue Date until this Debenture is no longer outstanding, this Debenture shall be
convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the Holder, at any time and from time to time (subject
to the conversion limitations set forth in Section 4(c) hereof). The Holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the
Company a Notice of Conversion, the form of which is attached hereto as  Annex A  (each, a   Notice of Conversion  ),
specifying therein the principal amount of this Debenture to be converted and the date on which such conversion shall be effected
(such date, or the date of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 4(d), the   Conversion Date  ). If no Conversion
Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date that such Notice of Conversion is actually delivered
hereunder. To effect conversions hereunder, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Debenture to the Company
unless the entire principal amount of this Debenture, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, has been so converted. Conversions
hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture in an amount equal to the applicable
conversion. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount(s) converted and the date of such conversion(s).
The Company may deliver an objection to any Notice of Conversion within 1 Business Day of delivery of such Notice of Conversion.
In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records of the Holder shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of
manifest error. 

b)    Conversion
Price . The conversion price in effect on any voluntary Conversion Date shall be equal to $0.25,   subject to adjustment
herein (the   Conversion Price  ). 

c)    Conversion
Limitations . Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Debenture, pursuant to Section 4 or otherwise,
to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after conversion the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates,
and any other person or entity acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates), would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of this Section beneficial ownership shall
be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Holder
is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. The Company shall have no obligation to verify
or confirm the accuracy of such filings.  In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined
after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Debenture, by the Holder or its
Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The   Beneficial
Ownership Limitation   shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Debenture. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days 
prior notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(c), provided
that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Debenture held by the Holder and the provisions
of this Section 4(c) shall continue to apply. Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61 st  day
after such notice is delivered to the Company. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of
this Debenture. 

d)    Automatic
Conversion . In the event that after the Original Issue Date through and including the Maturity Date the Company shall close
an underwritten public offering, for cash (the  Public Offering Closing ), of Common Stock, or any security convertible
into or exercisable of exchangeable for shares of Common stock (a  Common Stock Equivalent ), then on the date of the
Public Offering Closing the entire outstanding principal amount of and accrued but unpaid interest on this Debenture shall automatically,
without necessity of any action by the Company or the Holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal
to the lesser of (i) the Conversion Price or (ii) 85% of the per share price to the public of the Common Stock (or of the conversion,
exercise or exchange price per share of Common Stock contained in the Common Stock Equivalent) sold in the Public Offering Closing
(the   Automatic Conversion Price  ). 

e)    Mechanics of Conversion . 

i.         Conversion
Shares Issuable Upon Conversion of Principal and Interest Amount . The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion
hereunder shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid
interest of this Debenture to be converted by (y) the Conversion Price then in effect or the Automatic Conversion Price, as applicable. 

ii.         Delivery
of Certificate Upon Conversion . Not later than four Trading Days after each Conversion Date (the   Share Delivery Date  ),
the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder (A) a certificate or certificates representing the Conversion
Shares which, on or after the six month anniversary of the Original Issue Date, shall be free of restrictive legends and trading
restrictions (other than those which may then be required by the Subscription Agreement) representing the number of Conversion
Shares being acquired upon the conversion of this Debenture and (B) a bank check in the amount of accrued and unpaid interest (if
the Company has elected or is required to pay accrued interest in cash). On the six month anniversary of the Original Issue Date,
the Company shall use its best efforts to deliver any certificate or certificates required to be delivered by the Company under
this Section 4(e) electronically through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar
functions. 

iii.         Failure
to Deliver Certificates . If in the case of any Notice of Conversion such certificate or certificates are not delivered to or
as directed by the applicable Holder by the fourth Trading Day after the Conversion Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect
by written notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates, to rescind such Conversion,
in which event the Company shall promptly return to the Holder any original Debenture delivered to the Company and the Holder shall
promptly return to the Company the Common Stock certificates representing the principal amount of this Debenture unsuccessfully
tendered for conversion to the Company. 

iv.         Obligation
Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Company s obligations to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion
of this Debenture in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by
the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against
any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach
or alleged breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged violation of law
by the Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the
Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares;  provided ,  however , that such delivery
shall not operate as a waiver by the Company of any such action the Company may have against the Holder. In the event the Holder
of this Debenture shall elect to convert any or all of the outstanding principal amount hereof, the Company may not refuse conversion
based on any claim that the Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with the Holder has been engaged in any violation of law,
agreement or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and or enjoining conversion
of all or part of this Debenture shall have been sought and obtained, and the Company posts a surety bond for the benefit of the
Holder in the amount of 130% of the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture, which is subject to the injunction, which bond
shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall
be payable to the Holder to the extent it obtains judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Company shall issue Conversion
Shares or, if applicable, cash, upon a properly noticed conversion. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder
such certificate or certificates pursuant to Section 4(e)(ii) by the fifth Trading Day after the Conversion Date, the Company shall
pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of principal amount being converted, $10
per Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the seventh (7 th ) Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin
to accrue) for each Trading Day after such fourth (4 th ) Trading Day until such certificates are delivered. Nothing herein
shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 7 hereof for the
Company s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and the Holder shall have the right to
pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance
and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant
to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

v.         Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates by the Share Delivery Date pursuant
to Section 4(e)(ii), and if after such Share Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open
market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in
satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating
to such Share Delivery Date (a   Buy-In  ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including
any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the
sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of
the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Debenture in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the attempted
conversion or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely
complied with its delivery requirements under Section 4(e)(ii). For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total
purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this Debenture with respect to which the
actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a
total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000.
The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and,
upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any
other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock
upon conversion of this Debenture as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

vi.         Reservation
of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . Subject to the Stockholder Approval, the Company covenants that it will at all times reserve
and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of
this Debenture and payment of interest on this Debenture, each as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual
contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Debentures), not less than such aggregate
number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Subscription Agreement) be
issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 5) upon the conversion of the outstanding principal amount
of this Debenture and payment of interest hereunder. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable
shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

vii.         Fractional
Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Debenture.
As to any fraction of a share which Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company shall at its
election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Conversion Price then in effect or the Automatic Conversion Price, as applicable or round up to the next whole share. 

viii.         Transfer
Taxes . The issuance of certificates for shares of the Common Stock on conversion of this Debenture shall be made without charge
to the Holder hereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such
certificates, provided that, the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved
in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of this Debenture
so converted and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons
requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Company that such tax has been paid. 

Section 5 .          Certain
Adjustments . 

a)    Stock
Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents
(which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon conversion of, or payment
of interest on, the Debentures), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines
(including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues,
in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion
Price then in effect shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding
any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective
immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall
become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)    Subsequent
Equity Sales . If, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding, the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, sells or grants
any option to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues (or announces any sale, grant
or any option to purchase or other disposition), any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents entitling any Person to acquire shares
of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the then Conversion Price (such lower price, the   Base
Conversion Price   and such issuances, collectively, a   Dilutive Issuance  ) (if the holder of the Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions,
floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued
in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than
the Conversion Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Conversion Price on such date of the Dilutive
Issuance), then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal the Base Conversion Price. Such adjustment shall be made whenever
such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made under this
Section 5(b) in respect of an Exempt Issuance. The Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than 1 Business Day following
the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section 5(b), indicating therein the applicable issuance
price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the   Dilutive
Issuance Notice  ). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant
to this Section 5(b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Conversion Shares
based upon the Base Conversion Price on or after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether the Holder accurately
refers to the Base Conversion Price in the Notice of Conversion. 

c)    Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding, (i) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed
pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property,
or (iv) the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common
Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a   Fundamental
Transaction  ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Debenture, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for
each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental
Transaction, the same kind and amount of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence
of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of 1 share of Common
Stock (the   Alternate Consideration  ). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion
Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable
in respect of 1 share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Conversion Price among
the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.
If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction,
then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of this Debenture
following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company
or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new debenture consistent with the foregoing provisions
and evidencing the Holder s right to convert such debenture into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement pursuant
to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with
the provisions of this Section 5(b) and insuring that this Debenture (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted
upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. 

d)    Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 5, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued and outstanding. 

e)    Notice
to the Holder . 

i.         Adjustment
to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 5, the Company shall
promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement
of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii.         Notice
to Allow Conversion by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on
the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C)
the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required
in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale
or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, of any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock
is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed at each office
or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of this Debenture, and shall cause to be delivered to the Holder at its last
address as it shall appear upon the Debenture Register, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective
date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution,
redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record
to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date
as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common
Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share
exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the
validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. The Holder is entitled to convert this Debenture during
the 20-day period commencing on the date of such notice through the effective date of the event triggering such notice. 

Section 6 .         Rule
144 . The Company covenants to use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate the public resale by Holder(s) of any Conversion
Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended. 

Section 7 .         Negative
Covenants . As long as any portion of this Debenture remains outstanding, unless the holders of at least 51% in principal amount
of the then outstanding Debentures shall have otherwise given prior written consent, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its subsidiaries (whether or not a Subsidiary on the Original Issue Date) to, directly or indirectly: 

a)   repay,
repurchase or offer to repay, repurchase or otherwise acquire any Indebtedness, other than the Debentures if on a pro-rata basis,
other than regularly scheduled principal and interest payments as such terms are in effect as of the Original Issue Date, provided
that such payments shall not be permitted if, at such time, or after giving effect to such payment, any Event of Default exist
or occur; or 

b)   enter
into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. 

Section 8 .           Events
of Default .

of Default   means, wherever used herein, any of the following events (whatever the reason for such event and whether
such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any
court, or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): 

i.      any default
in the payment of (A) the principal amount of any Debenture or (B) interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing to a Holder
on any Debenture, as and when the same shall become due and payable (whether on a Conversion Date or the Maturity Date or by acceleration
or otherwise) which default, solely in the case of an interest payment or other default under clause (B) above, is not cured within
5 Trading Days; 

ii.     the
Company shall fail to observe or perform any other covenant or agreement contained in the Debentures (other than a breach by the
Company of its obligations to deliver shares of Common Stock to the Holder upon conversion, which breach is addressed in clause
(xi) below) which failure is not cured, if possible to cure, within the earlier to occur of (A) 7 Trading Days after notice of
such failure sent by the Holder or by any other Holder to the Company and (B) 12 Trading Days after the Company has become or should
have become aware of such failure; 

iii.    a default
or Event of Default (subject to any grace or cure period provided in the applicable agreement, document or instrument) shall occur
under (A) any of the Transaction Documents or (B) any other agreement, lease, document or instrument to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is obligated (and not covered by clause (vi) below) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

iv.    the
Company shall fail to satisfy its obligations to obtain Stockholder Approval under Section 5.12 of the Subscription Agreement on

report, financial statement or certificate made or delivered to the Holder or any other Holder shall be untrue or incorrect in
any material respect as of the date when made or deemed made; 

vi.    the
Company or any Significant Subsidiary (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X) shall be subject to a Bankruptcy
Event; 

vii.   the
Company or any Subsidiary shall default on any of its obligations under any mortgage, credit agreement or other facility, indenture
agreement, factoring agreement or other instrument under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced,
any indebtedness for borrowed money or money due under any long term leasing or factoring arrangement that (a) involves an obligation

becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise become due and payable;

listing or quotation for trading thereon within seven Trading Days; 

ix.     the
Company shall be a party to any Change of Control Transaction or Fundamental Transaction or shall agree to sell or dispose of all
or in excess of 40% of its assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions (whether or not such sale would constitute
a Change of Control Transaction); 

x.      the Company
shall fail for any reason to deliver certificates to a Holder on or prior to the fifth Trading Day after a Conversion Date pursuant
to Section 4(e) or the Company shall provide at any time notice to the Holder, including by way of public announcement, of the
Company s intention to not honor requests for conversions of any Debentures in accordance with the terms hereof; or 

xi.     any
monetary judgment, writ or similar final process shall be entered or filed against the Company, any subsidiary or any of their
respective property or other assets for more than $50,000, and such judgment, writ or similar final process shall remain unvacated,
unbonded or unstayed for a period of 45 calendar days. 

b)    Remedies
Upon Event of Default . If any Event of Default occurs, the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture, plus accrued but
unpaid interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become,
at the Holder s election, immediately due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount. Commencing 5 days after the
occurrence of any Event of Default that results in the eventual acceleration of this Debenture, the interest rate on this Debenture
shall accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. Upon
the payment in full of the Mandatory Default Amount, the Holder shall promptly surrender this Debenture to or as directed by the
Company. In connection with such acceleration described herein, the Holder need not provide, and the Company hereby waives, any
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, and the Holder may immediately and without expiration of any grace period
enforce any and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under applicable law. Such acceleration
may be rescinded and annulled by Holder at any time prior to payment hereunder and the Holder shall have all rights as a holder
of the Debenture until such time, if any, as the Holder receives full payment pursuant to this Section 8(b). No such rescission
or annulment shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

d)    Governing

by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of
conflict of laws thereof. Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretation, enforcement and defense of
the transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction Documents (whether brought against a party hereto or its respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents) shall be commenced in the state and federal courts sitting in the City
of New York, Borough of Manhattan (the   New York Courts  ). Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any
transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents),
and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of such New York Courts, or such New York Courts are improper or inconvenient venue for such proceeding.
Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action
or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such
party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Debenture and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient
service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process
in any other manner permitted by applicable law. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Debenture or the

then the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the other party for its attorneys fees and other
costs and expenses incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding. 

e)    Waiver .
Any waiver by the Company or the Holder of a breach of any provision of this Debenture shall not operate as or be construed to
be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Debenture. The failure of the
Company or the Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Debenture on one or more occasions shall not be considered
a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Debenture.
Any waiver by the Company or the Holder must be in writing. 

f)     Severability .
If any provision of this Debenture is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Debenture shall remain in effect,
and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons
and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable
law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of
interest permitted under applicable law. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at
any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury
law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest on
this Debenture as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this indenture, and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits
or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution
of any power herein granted to the Holder, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been
enacted. 

g)    Next
Business Day . Whenever any payment or other obligation hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. 

h)    Headings .
The headings contained herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Debenture and shall not be deemed to limit
or affect any of the provisions hereof. 

i)     Assumption . 
Any successor to the Company or any surviving entity in a Fundamental Transaction shall (i) assume, prior to such Fundamental Transaction,
all of the obligations of the Company under this Debenture and the other Transaction Documents pursuant to written agreements in
form and substance satisfactory to the Holder (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (ii) issue to the
Holder a new debenture of such successor entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to
this Debenture, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amount and the
interest rate of this Debenture and having similar ranking to this Debenture, which shall be satisfactory to the Holder (any such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  The provisions of this Section 9(i) shall apply similarly and equally
to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations of this Debenture.

Section 2 .              Exercise . 

a)             Exercise
of Warrant . Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times
on or after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or
agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing

has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three
(3) Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting
in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding
number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder
and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. In the event
of any dispute or discrepancy, the records of the Company shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. 

2   

b)             Exercise
Price . The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be  $ 0.325  1  ,
subject to adjustment hereunder (the    Exercise Price   ). 

c)             Exercise
Limitations . Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to
the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s affiliates, and
any other person or entity acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s affiliates), would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of this Section, beneficial ownership shall
be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Holder
is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. The Company shall have no obligation to verify
or confirm the accuracy of such filings. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after
giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its affiliates
since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The    Beneficial Ownership
Limitation    shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect
to the issuance of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days  prior notice
to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(c), provided that the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation may not exceed 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section
2(c) shall continue to apply, unless the Holder upon not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Company determines to waive
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation requirements described in this Section 2(c) in its entirety. Any such increase or decrease
will not be effective until the 61 st  day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The limitations contained in
this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.

  A thirty percent premium over the conversion price. 

3   

d)            Mechanics
of Exercise . 

i.             Delivery
of Certificates Upon Exercise . Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the Company s transfer
agent (the    Transfer Agent   ) to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder s prime broker
with the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (   DWAC   ) system if
the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the resale
of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the shares are eligible for resale without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant
to Rule 144, and otherwise by physical delivery of certificates to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise
within four (4) Trading Days from the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise Form, surrender of this Warrant (if required)
and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as set forth above (the    Warrant Share Delivery Date   ). This
Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date the Exercise Price is received by the Company. The Warrant Shares shall
be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become
a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised by payment to the Company of
the Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to Section 2(d)(vi) prior to the issuance
of such shares, have been paid. If the Company is obligated to and fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder certificates evidencing
the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in
cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise, $10 per Trading Day
(increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the seventh Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day
after such Warrant Share Delivery Date until such certificates are delivered. 

ii.          Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Warrant
Shares, deliver to Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by
this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

iii.          Rescission
Rights . If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing
the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind
such exercise. 

iv.         Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates by the Warrant Share Delivery Date,
and if after such Warrant Share Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction
or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a
sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Warrant
Share Delivery Date (a    Buy-In   ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to
any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including
any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of Warrant Shares
that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue multiplied by (2) the price at
which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the
option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise
was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example,
if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise
of this Warrant with respect to which the sale price of the Warrant Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to
such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect
of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Warrant
Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

4   

v.           No
Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise
of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company
shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied
by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

vi.          Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or
transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall
be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed
by the Holder;  provided ,  however , that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other
than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the assignment form (   Assignment
Form   ) attached hereto as Exhibit B duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition thereto,
the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. 

vii.          Closing
of Books . The Company will not close its shareholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this
Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof. 

Section 3 .              Redemption
of Warrant . Commencing at any time after the date on which after the Common Stock closing bid price reported by Bloomberg LP
remains at an amount $0.75  2   per share (as adjusted
for forward or reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other similar proportionately-applied change) for at least twenty (20)
consecutive Trading Days (the    Call Condition   ), the Company shall have the right, upon sixty (60) days 
notice to the Holder given not later than thirty (30) Trading Days after the date on which the Call Condition is satisfied (the
   Redemption Notice   ) to redeem the number of Warrant Shares specified in the Redemption Notice, less
any amount previously exercised, at a price of $0.01 per Warrant Share (the    Redemption Price   ), on the
date set forth in the Redemption Notice, but in no event earlier than sixty (60) days following the date of the receipt by the
Holder of the Redemption Notice (the    Redemption Date   ). The Redemption Notice shall be provided to the
Holder promptly and in all events within five (5) Trading Days after Company announces its intention to exercise its redemptions
rights under this section. The Holder may exercise this Warrant at any time (in whole or in part) prior to the Redemption Date.
Any portion of this Warrant that is subject to the Call Condition which is not exercised by 5:30 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Redemption
Date shall no longer be exercisable and shall be returned to the Company (and, if not so returned, shall automatically be deemed
canceled), and the Company, upon its receipt of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, shall issue therefore in full and complete
satisfaction of its obligations under such called but unexercised portion of this Warrant to the Holder an amount equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock called but remaining unexercised multiplied by the Redemption Price. The Redemption Price shall
be mailed to such Holder at its address of record, and the Warrant shall be canceled.

Section 4 .              Certain
Adjustments . 

a)             Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
make a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Warrant Shares issued by the Company upon exercise
of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the
aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become
effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)            Subsequent
Equity Sales . If the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall
sell or grant any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any
offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents entitling any Person
to acquire shares of Common Stock, at an effective price per share less than the then Exercise Price (such lower price, the   Base
Share Price   and such issuances collectively, a     Dilutive Issuance    ) (if the holder
of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments,
reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share
which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share
which is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such
date of the Dilutive Issuance), then, the Exercise Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal the Base Share Price and the
number of Warrant Shares issuable hereunder shall be increased such that the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder, after
taking into account the decrease in the Exercise Price, shall be equal to the aggregate Exercise Price prior to such adjustment.
Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no adjustments shall be made, paid or issued under this Section 3(b) in respect of an Exempt Issuance. The Company shall notify
the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject
to this Section 3(b), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price
and other pricing terms (such notice, the     Dilutive Issuance Notice    ). For purposes of clarification,
whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 3(b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive
Issuance, after the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares based upon the
Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise 

6   

c)             Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to the other subsections of this Section 4, if at any time the Company
grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata
to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the    Purchase Rights   ), then the Holder
will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder
could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant
(without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately
before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken,
the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase
Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result
in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase
Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent)
and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto
would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

d)             Pro
Rata Distributions . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common
Stock (and not to the Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase any security other than the Common Stock, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be adjusted
by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the record date mentioned
above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less than the per share fair market value at such record
date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness or rights or warrants so distributed applicable to one outstanding
share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. In either case the adjustments shall be described
in a statement provided to the Holder of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription
rights applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall
become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above. 

7   

e)             Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series
of related transactions, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant
to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property or (iv)
the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock
is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (each    Fundamental Transaction   ),
then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would
have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, the number of shares
of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional
consideration (the    Alternate Consideration   ) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction
by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental
Transaction. For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply
to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock
in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable
manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are
given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given
the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction.
To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental
Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder s
right to exercise such warrant into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction
is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this Section
4(d) and insuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction
analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction that
is (1) an all cash transaction, (2) a  Rule 13e-3 transaction  as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, or
(3) a Fundamental Transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange, the Company or any successor
entity shall pay concurrently with the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, and the Holder shall accept an amount of cash
equal to the value of this Warrant as determined in accordance with the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the  OV 
function on Bloomberg L.P. using (A) a price per share of Common Stock equal to the VWAP of the Common Stock for the Trading Day
immediately preceding the date of consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (B) a risk-free interest rate corresponding
to the U.S. Treasury rate for a 30 day period immediately prior to the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction,
(C) an expected volatility equal to the 100 day volatility obtained from the  HVT  function on Bloomberg L.P. determined
as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and (D) a remaining
option time equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of such transaction and the Termination Date; provided
that in each case where Bloomberg L.P. data is being relied upon, Holder shall provide to the Company a copy of such information
for the Company's records. 

f)              Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 4 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 4, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

g)             Notice
to Holder . 

i.             Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 4, the Company shall promptly
mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts
requiring such adjustment. 

8   

ii.          Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, of any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last
address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or
effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common
Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the
date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or
close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares
of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall
not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. The Holder is entitled to exercise this
Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such notice. 

Section 5 .              Transfer
of Warrant . 

a)             Transferability .
Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws and the conditions set forth in Section 5(d) herein and to the provisions
of the Subscription Agreement, this Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are
transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent,
together with a written assignment of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder or its
agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender
and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or
assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue
to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled.
The Warrant, if properly assigned, may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant
issued. 

b)             New
Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the
Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by
the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 5(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such
division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants
to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the Initial
Exercise Date and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto. 

9   

c)           Warrant
Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the    Warrant
Register   ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered
Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and
for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

d)           Transfer
Restrictions . If, at the time of the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer of this Warrant, the transfer
of this Warrant shall not be either (i) registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and
under applicable state securities or blue sky laws or (ii) eligible for resale without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant
to Rule 144, the Company may require, as a condition of allowing such transfer, that the Holder or transferee of this Warrant,
as the case may be, comply with the provisions of the Subscription Agreement. 

Section 6 .              Miscellaneous . 

a)           No
Rights as Shareholder Until Exercise . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder
of the Company prior to the exercise hereof. 

b)           Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of
the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate,
if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation,
in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate. 

c)           Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or
granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Business Day. 

d)           Authorized
Shares . 

Subject to
Shareholder Approval (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement), the Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant
is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock one hundred (100%) of the number of shares to provide
for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant. In case such amount of Common
Stock is insufficient at any time, the Company shall call and hold a special meeting to increase the number of authorized shares
of common stock. Management of the Company shall recommend to shareholders to vote in favor of increasing the number of authorized
shares of common stock. 

The Company
further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty
of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the
purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant
Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading
Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise
of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant, be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect
of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). 

10   

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance
or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such
terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in
this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value
of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii)
take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such
authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable
the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before
taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or
in the Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary
from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e)             Jurisdiction .
All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Subscription Agreement. 

f)             Restrictions .
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g)            Nonwaiver
and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate
as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice Holder s rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that all rights
hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this
Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient
to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys  fees, including those of appellate proceedings,
incurred by Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies
hereunder. 

h)            Notices .
Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered
in accordance with the notice provisions of the Subscription Agreement. 

11   

i)              Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase
Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of Holder, shall give rise to any liability of Holder for
the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company or
by creditors of the Company. 

j)              Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k)             Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder. The provisions
of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of all Holders from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable by
the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

l)              Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder. 

m)            Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
of this Warrant. 

n)             Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of
this Warrant.

Section 2 .            Exercise .

i.  Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at
any time or times on or after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company (or such
other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder
appearing on the books of the Company) of a duly executed notice of exercise (   Notice of Exercise   ) form
attached hereto as Exhibit A; and, within 3 Trading Days of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company, the Company
shall have received payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier s
check drawn on a United States bank. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically
surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant
has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within 3 Trading
Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases
of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number
of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and
the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. In the event

shall tender to the Company the Warrant for the amount being exchanged, along with written notice of Holder s election to
exchange some or all of the Warrant, and the Company shall issue to Holder the number of shares of the Common Stock computed using
the following formula:   

X =  
      Y (A-B)   

A   

Where:  X =  
      the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to Holder.   

Y =  
      the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under the amount of the Warrant being exchanged (as adjusted to the date of such calculation).   

A =  
      the Fair Market Value of one share of the Common Stock on the date that the notice of exercise is received by the Company.   

B =  
     
         Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation).   

b)            Exercise Price . The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be  $ 0.325 subject
to adjustment hereunder (the    Exercise Price   ). 

c)            Exercise Limitations . Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section
2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s
affiliates, and any other person or entity acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s affiliates),
would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of this Section, beneficial
ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. The Company shall have no obligation
to verify or confirm the accuracy of such filings. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined
after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its affiliates
since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The    Beneficial Ownership
Limitation    shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect
to the issuance of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days  prior notice
to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2.3, provided that the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section
2(c) shall continue to apply. Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61 st  day after such notice
is delivered to the Company. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant. 

d)              Mechanics of Exercise . 

i.  Delivery
of Certificates Upon Exercise . Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the Company s transfer
agent (the    Transfer Agent   ) to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder s prime broker
with the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (   DWAC   ) system if
the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the resale
of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the shares are eligible for resale without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant
to Rule 144, and otherwise by physical delivery of certificates to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise
within 4 Trading Days from the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise Form, surrender of this Warrant (if required)
and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as set forth above (the    Warrant Share Delivery Date   ). This
Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date the Exercise Price is received by the Company. The Warrant Shares shall
be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become
a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised by payment to the Company of
the Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to Section 2(d)(vi) prior to the issuance
of such shares, have been paid. If the Company is obligated to and fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder certificates evidencing
the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in
cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise, $10 per Trading Day
(increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the seventh Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day
after such Warrant Share Delivery Date until such certificates are delivered. 

ii.  Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Warrant
Shares, deliver to Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by
this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

iii.  Rescission
Rights . If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing
the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind
such exercise. 

iv.        Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates by the Warrant Share Delivery Date,
and if after such Warrant Share Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction
or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a
sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Warrant
Share Delivery Date (a    Buy-In   ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to
any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including
any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of Warrant Shares
that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue multiplied by (2) the price at
which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the
option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise
was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example,
if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise
of this Warrant with respect to which the sale price of the Warrant Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to
such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect
of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Warrant
Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

v.      
  No Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon
the exercise of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise,
the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

vi.      
  Charges, Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder
for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and
expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names
as may be directed by the Holder;  provided ,  however , that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be
issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the assignment
form (   Assignment Form   ) attached hereto as Exhibit B duly executed by the Holder and the Company may
require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. 

vii.      
  Closing of Books . The Company will not close its shareholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely
exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof. 

Section 3 .            Certain Adjustments . 

a)              Stock Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend
or otherwise make a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities
payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Warrant Shares issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the
aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become
effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)            Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to the other subsections of this Section 3, if at any time the Company
grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata
to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the  Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled
to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired
if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to
any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as
of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights
(provided, however, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder
exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such
extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase
Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in
the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

c)            Pro
Rata Distributions . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common
Stock (and not to the Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase any security other than the Common Stock, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be adjusted
by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the record date mentioned
above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the than per share fair market value at such record
date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness or rights or warrants so distributed applicable to one outstanding
share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. In either case the adjustments shall be described
in a statement provided to the Holder of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription
rights applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall
become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above. 

d)            Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series
of related transactions, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant
to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property or (iv)
the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock
is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (each, a    Fundamental Transaction   ),
then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would
have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, the number of shares
of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional
consideration (the    Alternate Consideration   ) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction
by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental
Transaction. For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply
to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock
in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable
manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are
given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given
the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction.
To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental
Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder s
right to exercise such warrant into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction
is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this Section
3(d) and insuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction
analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction that
is (1) an all cash transaction, (2) a  Rule 13e-3 transaction  as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, or
(3) a Fundamental Transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange, the Company or any successor
entity shall pay concurrently with the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, and the Holder shall accept an amount of cash
equal to the value of this Warrant as determined in accordance with the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the  OV 
function on Bloomberg L.P. using (A) a price per share of Common Stock equal to the VWAP of the Common Stock for the Trading Day
immediately preceding the date of consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (B) a risk-free interest rate corresponding
to the U.S. Treasury rate for a 30 day period immediately prior to the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction,
(C) an expected volatility equal to the 100 day volatility obtained from the  HVT  function on Bloomberg L.P. determined
as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and (D) a remaining
option time equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of such transaction and the Termination Date; provided
that in each case where Bloomberg L.P. data is being relied upon, Holder shall provide to the Company a copy of such information
for the Company's records. 

e)           If
at any time until earliest of (1) the Termination Date, (2) the date that this Warrant is exercised in full or (3) the date that
the Company s shares of common stock are approved for an uplisting to a senior U.S. exchange such as The NASDAQ STOCK MARKET
or the NYSE MKT, the Company issues or sells any additional shares of Common Stock (   Additional Shares of Common Stock   ),
excluding any shares of Common Stock sold in connection with an Exempt Issuance, for consideration per share of Common Stock that
is less than $0.25 (as such amount may be adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or
similar transaction after the date hereof) (a    Dilutive Issuance   ), on the date of and immediately prior
to the Dilutive Issuance, the Exercise Price, then in effect, will be reduced concurrently with the Dilutive Issuance to a price
(rounded to the nearest cent) calculated by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction, of which (i) the numerator shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance plus the
number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Company for the total number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Dilutive Issuance would purchase at the Exercise Price; and (ii) the
denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately prior to such Dilutive
Issuance plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued. The provisions of this Section 3(e) shall not operate
to increase the Exercise Price 

f)            Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

g)            Notice
to Holder . 

i.                              
  Adjustment to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3,
the Company shall promptly mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting forth
a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii.                              
  Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever
form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common
Stock, (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be required
in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale
or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, of any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock
is converted into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder
at its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable
record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose
of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders
of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined
or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective
or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof
shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. The Holder is entitled to exercise
this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such notice. 

Section 4 .            Transfer of Warrant . 

a)              Transferability . The Holder of this Warrant agrees by his, her or its acceptance hereof, that such Holder will not:
(a) sell, transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate this Warrant for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the date
on which the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-211674) of the Company was declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the    Effective Date   ) to anyone other than: (i) Laidlaw   Company (UK) Ltd.,
or (ii) a bona fide officer or partner of Laidlaw   Company (UK) Ltd., in each case in accordance with FINRA Conduct Rule 5110(g)(1),
or (b) cause this Warrant or the securities issuable hereunder to be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or
call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of this Warrant or the securities hereunder, except as
provided for in FINRA Conduct Rule 5110(g)(2). On and after one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Date, transfers to
others may be made subject to compliance with or exemptions from applicable securities laws. 

b)             Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws and the conditions set forth in Section 4(a) herein, this Warrant
and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender
of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant
substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any
transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall
execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination
or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion
of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. The Warrant, if properly assigned, may be exercised
by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued. 

c)      
  New Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid
office of the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued,
signed by the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved
in such division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or
Warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated
the Initial Exercise Date and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant
thereto. 

d)              Warrant Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that
purpose (the    Warrant Register   ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company
may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or
any distribution to the Holder, and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

e)              Transfer Restrictions . If, at the time of the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer of this Warrant,
the transfer of this Warrant shall not be either (i) registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws or (ii) eligible for resale without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions
pursuant to Rule 144, the Company may require, as a condition of allowing such transfer, that the Holder or transferee of this
Warrant, as the case may be, comply with the provisions hereof. 

Section 5 .            Miscellaneous . 

a)              No Rights as Shareholder Until Exercise . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other rights
as a shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof. 

b)              Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to
the Warrant Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in
the case of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock
certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such
cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate. 

c)              Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of
any right required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised
on the next succeeding Business Day. 

d)              Authorized Shares . 

The Company
covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock one
hundred (100%) of the number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights
under this Warrant. In case such amount of Common Stock is insufficient at any time, the Company shall call and hold a special
meeting to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. Management of the Company shall recommend to shareholders
to vote in favor of increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock. 

The Company
further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty
of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the
purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant
Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading
Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise
of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant, be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect
of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). 

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the
taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against
impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares
above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action
as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant
Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions
or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform
its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before taking
any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary
from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e)              Jurisdiction . This Warrant shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York without regard
to the conflict of laws principles of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction. 

f)              Restrictions . The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not
registered, will have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g)              Nonwaiver and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part
of Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice Holder s rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding
the fact that all rights hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with
any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to Holder such amounts
as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys  fees, including
those of appellate proceedings, incurred by Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any
of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder. 

h)              Notices . Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the
Company shall be delivered at the following address: 

Laidlaw   Company
(UK) Ltd. 

 546 Fifth Avenue 

 New York, New
York 10036            

i)             in accordance with the notice provisions of the Amended Engagement Agreement. 

j)              Limitation of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by Holder to exercise this
Warrant to purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of Holder, shall give rise to any liability
of Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by
the Company or by creditors of the Company. 

k)              Remedies . The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of
damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would
not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees
to waive and not to assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

l)              Successors and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced
hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of all Holders from time to time of this Warrant and

I, Stephen Turner, certify that:

2.  Based on my knowledge, this report
                                         does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
                                         fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
                                         such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
                                         report;   

3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial

                                         the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;   

4.  The registrant s other certifying
                                         officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
                                         and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal
                                         control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f))
                                         for the registrant and have:   

a)  designed such disclosure controls
                                         and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                                         our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including
                                         its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                                         during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b)  designed such internal control
                                         over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to
                                         be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
                                         of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
                                         in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

                                         the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our
                                         conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of
                                         the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   

d)  disclosed in this report any change
                                         in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                                         the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter
                                         in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                                         to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
                                         and   

5.  The registrant s other certifying
                                         officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
                                         over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's
                                         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)  all deficiencies and material weaknesses
                                         in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
                                         likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and
                                         report financial information; and   

b)  any fraud, whether or not material,
                                         that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
                                         internal control over financial reporting.
