Statements

and 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Operations  

Carolco Pictures, Inc. (the  Company )
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in February 2009 under the name  York Entertainment, Inc. 
The Company changed its name to Brick Top Productions, Inc. in October 2010. In January 2015, the Company changed its name from
Brick Top Productions, Inc. to Carolco Pictures, Inc. and changed its stock symbol from  BTOP  to  CRCO.  

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as promulgated
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and with instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange
Act. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, we have included all adjustments considered necessary
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) for a fair presentation. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. You should read these
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto
included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on November 22, 2016. The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements included in
the Form 10-K for that year. 

Going Concern  

The Company s consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements,
the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $8,096,000 at September 30, 2016, and incurred a net loss of $5,103,000 and utilized
net cash used in operating activities of $302,000 for the nine months then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In addition, the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements, has
raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to execute its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds.
Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of debt and equity securities for cash to operate
its business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms
that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions
on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.
Management estimates that the current funds on hand as of the date of this report will be sufficient to continue operations through
December 31, 2016. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Use of estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Those estimates and assumptions include depreciable lives of property and equipment, analysis of impairments of recorded goodwill,
accruals for potential liabilities, assumptions made in valuing derivative liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments
issued for services. 

Principles of Consolidation   

The Company s consolidated subsidiaries and/or entities are
as follows: 

The accompanying
financial statements are consolidated and include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. The consolidated
accounts include 100% of the assets and liabilities of our majority owned subsidiaries, and the ownership interests of minority
investors are recorded as a minority interest.  All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) for disclosures
about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB ASC ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 )
to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair
value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described:  

Level 1  
      Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level 2  
      Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.   

Level 3  
      Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when
their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one
significant model assumption or input is unobservable. 

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the
categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 

The carrying amounts of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, other assets, accounts payable and accrued payroll, approximate their fair values
because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of notes payable and convertible notes approximate their
fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates. 

The carrying amount of the Company s
derivative liability of $8,110,000 and $4,673,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, was based on Level
2 measurements. 

Concentrations   

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had one customer that accounted for 100% and 85%, 79% and 57% of sales, respectively. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company specializes in the development
and presentation of television programming including series, specials, pilots, live events and award shows. The Company recognizes
revenue from its live events and award show productions when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, (ii) the show or live event has been completed and occurred and there are no future production obligations,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Revenues from the sale of programming for television
and other media will be recognized when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii)
the show/episode is complete, and in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, has been delivered or is available for immediate
and unconditional delivery; (iii) the price to the customer is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company periodically issues stock options
and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company
accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB
where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis
over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance
with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined
at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn
the equity instruments is complete. Options and warrants granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine
the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options and warrants vest, they are valued on each vesting
date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date
of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option and warrant
grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. 

The fair value of the Company s stock
option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related
to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation
expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience.
The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in
future periods. 

Deposit for Film Project to Related Party   

Deposit for film project includes capitalizable
production costs, production overhead, interest, development costs and acquired production costs and are stated at the lower of
cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value.  The amount by which the unamortized
costs of film and television productions exceed their estimated fair values is written off. Film development costs for projects
that have been abandoned or have not been set for production within three years are generally written off.  

Capitalized Production Costs    

Capitalized production costs consist of capitalized
costs pursuant to contractual amount due or paid by the Company for development of virtual reality content, films produced or film
rights acquired in preparation of development. Capitalized costs include all direct production and production overhead. 

In accordance with current accounting guidelines,
the Company will amortize capitalized production costs using the individual film forecast computation method, whereby these costs
are amortized and participations and residuals costs are accrued in the proportion that current year s revenue bears to management s
estimate of ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or
sale of the virtual reality content, films or television programs. 

Capitalized production costs are stated at
lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. The valuation of capitalized production costs is reviewed on a title-by-title
basis, when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a film or television program is less than its
unamortized cost. In determining the fair value of our programs, the Company projects revenue in future periods to create an ultimate
revenue. 

Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a
period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release or from the date of delivery of the first episode for episodic
television series. Ultimate revenue is reviewed and revised at least once per year. 

During the period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company capitalized production costs amounting to $54,000 for projects that are still in development. 

Intangible Assets   

Intangible assets consist of employment agreements
acquired as a result of the acquisition of Recall Studios, Inc. ( Recall ) in July 2016 and are accounted in accordance
with current accounting guidelines and amortized over their expected life. Intangibles are valued at their fair market value and
are amortized taking into account the character of the acquired intangible asset and the expected period of benefit. The Company
evaluates intangible assets for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable from its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Recoverability of intangible
assets is measured by comparing their net book value to the related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets, considering
a number of factors, including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and product development cycles.
If the net book value of the asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset is considered impaired, and a second
test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining
intangible assets of $828,000. There were no indications of impairment based on management s assessment of these assets at
September 30, 2016. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance
relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the
strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. If current economic conditions worsen
causing decreased revenues and increased costs, we may have to record impairment to our intangible assets. 

Loss Per Share   

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
loss per share reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock method that could occur if securities or other contracts
to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in the loss of the Company. In computing diluted loss per share, the treasury stock method assumes that outstanding options and
warrants are exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Options
and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common stock
during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
there were 2,952,600 warrants outstanding, which were excluded from the loss per share calculation as they were anti-dilutive. 

Derivative Financial Instruments   

The Company evaluates its financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial
instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then
re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The Company uses a probability
weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates
through the September 30, 2016 reporting date. 

The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard
that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach
for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred
goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments
and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect
adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s
financial statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for
all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital
and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02
on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued the ASU
2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) : Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The
amendments in this ASU require, among other things, that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement
when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than
it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for
forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company
is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did
not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated financial
statement presentation or disclosures. 

NOTE 3    Acquisition of Recall Studios, Inc.   

On July 25, 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement whereby, the Company issued 25,256,250 shares of Series C Stock and 1,990,000 shares of Series A stock with an estimated
fair value of $1.2 million in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Recall. Recall is a Nevada corporation in
the business of developing and producing Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) content and devices. 

The acquisition of Recall has been accounted for as a purchase and
the operations of Recall have been consolidated since July 25, 2016, the effective date of the acquisition. The $1.2 million purchase
price was allocated based upon the fair value of the acquired assets, as determined by management with the assistance of an independent
valuation firm. The purchase price and allocation of the purchase price was as follows: 

Purchase
price:          

Purchase price allocation:         

Management used valuation of $0.046 per share
or $1,161,000 to value the 25,256,250 shares of Series C Stock, based on various inputs, including a valuation report prepared
by the third-party valuation firm. There are numerous acceptable ways to estimate company value, including using net tangible assets,
a market-based approach, or discounted cash flows. The Company considered alternative methods and concluded that due to the lack
of suitably comparable market data, the discounted cash flows method was the most appropriate. A discounted cash flows (i.e. free
cash flows to equity) methodology was applied by the third-party valuation firm using multiple years of balance sheet and income
statement projections. Management used a valuation of $0.030 per share or $60,000 to value the 1,990,000 shares of Series A Stock
issued based upon the most recent sale of the Series A for cash. 

The Company estimates that the intangible assets
will have a life of one year which is equal to the terms of the employment and covenants not to compete agreements. 

During the period ended September 30, 2015,
the Company recorded amortization expense of $276,000. As of September 30, 2016, the unamortized balance of these intangible assets
amounted to $848,000. 

The Company did not disclose pro forma financial
statements pursuant to FASB Topic 805  Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations 
as Recall was established and started operations during April 2016, and its operations were insignificant. 

Note 4   Deposit for Film Project Paid to Related Party  

In April 2015, the Company entered into an
agreement with Mr. Mario Kassar, who at the time was the Chairman of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement (the  Kassar
Agreement ), the Company provided $250,000 in funding to a company managed by Mr. Kassar for the production of a film initially
titled  Audition.  

Pursuant to the terms of the Kassar Agreement,
the Company engaged Mr. Kassar to render producing and sales services for each film in the  Rambo  franchise,  SMITE 
franchise or other feature length motion picture property introduced to the Company by Mr. Kassar (each, a  Picture )
on the same terms as apply to  Audition,  except that the producing fee shall not be less than 10% of the budget of
each Picture. The Company also agreed to pay Mr. Kassar 5% of the purchase price of any Carolco-produced feature length films in
the  Rambo  franchise and all completed films or film libraries acquired by the Company with Mr. Kassar s assistance
and based on Mr. Kassar s introduction to the Company of such completed films or film libraries. The terms of the Kassar
Agreement also provide that the Company will pay Mr. Kassar a discretionary bonus in relation to his efforts in bringing projects
and opportunities to the Company. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Audition project
was still in pre-production stage. The Company determined there was no impairment of the deposit at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 due to the early stages of the film production. 

Note 5  Note Payable  

The Company has a note payable to a financial
institution pursuant to which the Company can make advances up to $75,000. The note payable is secured by certain of the Company s
assets, bears an average interest rate of 5% per annum and will mature in April 2017. As of December 31, 2015, total outstanding
note payable amounted to $44,000. 

During the period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company received advances of $31,000 and accrued and paid interest of $2,000. As of September 30, 2016, outstanding balance
of the note amounted to $75,000. 

Note 6- Convertible Notes Payable   

Convertible notes payable consist of the following as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(a)  
      On May 6, 2015, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $91,000 to St. George Investments, LLC (the  Lender ). The note bore interest at 22% per annum, as amended and matured in April 2016. Under the terms of the note, there was an original issue discount ( OID ) of $8,000 withheld at funding and the Company agreed to pay $3,000 to the Lender to cover the Lender s legal fees and other transaction related costs. The Company recognized the OID as a note discount and the $3,000 fee as debt issuance costs. Both the note discount and issuance costs recognized in the transaction were accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. In addition, the Company paid an $8,000 finders  fee in the transaction which has been recorded in debt issuance costs and is being accreted to interest expense of the life of the note. The note was convertible by the Lender into common stock of the Company at the lesser of $0.45 per share or, in the event the Company s market capitalization falls below $15.0 million, at a defined Lender conversion price. As of December 31, 2015, outstanding balance of the note amounted to $56,000 and accrued interest of $3,000.   

During the nine months
    ended September 30, 2016, the Company accrued interest of $3,000 and paid off the entire principal note balance of $56,000
    and accrued interest of $6,000.   

(b)  
      On May 12, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $104,000 to the Vis Vires Group, Inc. ( VVG ). The note bore interest at 22% per annum, as amended, and matured in February 2016. VVG deducted $2,000 from the proceeds to cover their legal and other transaction related costs which was recorded as debt issuance costs and is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. The note carried a variable conversion price defined as 61% of the market price (representing a 39% discount), with market price being defined as the average of the lowest three trading days for the Company s common stock during the 10-day period prior to the conversion date. As of December 31, 2015, outstanding balance of the note amounted to $78,000 and accrued interest of $9,000.    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accrued interest of $3,000, paid off the note and accrued interest in the aggregate of $79,000 and converted the remaining principal balance of $11,000 to 5,978,947 shares of common stock.   

(c)  
      On June 22, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $88,000 to the Auctus Fund, LLC ( Auctus ). The note bears interest at 24% per annum, as amended, and matured in March 2016. Auctus deducted $8,000 from the proceeds to cover their legal and other transaction related costs which were recorded as debt issuance costs and is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. In addition, the Company paid an $8,000 finders  fee in this transaction which has been recorded in debt issuance costs and was accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. The note carried a variable conversion price defined as 50% of the market price (representing a 50% discount), with market price being defined as the lowest trading price of our common stock during the 25-trading day period prior to the conversion date. As of December 31, 2015, outstanding balance of the note amounted to $86,000 and accrued interest of $7,000.    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company converted principal and accrued interest in the aggregate of $38,000 to 160,752,578 shares of common stock. In addition, the Company settled with the note holder the remaining principal balance of $53,000 in exchange for cash payment of $25,000 which resulted in gain of $28,000. As of September 30, 2016, there were no outstanding note balance and accrued interest.   

(d)  
      On July 10, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $52,500 to VVG. The note bore interest at 22% per annum, as amended and matured in April 2016. VVG deducted $1,000 from the proceeds to cover their legal related costs which were charged to interest expense. The note carried a variable conversion price defined as 61% of the market price (representing a 39% discount), with market price being defined as the average of the lowest three trading days for the Company s common stock during the 10-day period prior to the conversion date. As of December 31, 2015, outstanding balance of the note amounted to $41,000 and accrued interest of $3,000.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company converted the entire principal and accrued interest amounting to $42,000 to 41,809,474 shares of common stock.   

The Company considered the current FASB guidance
of  Contracts in Entity s Own Stock  which indicates that any adjustment to the fixed amount (either conversion
price or number of shares) of the instrument regardless of the probability of whether or not within the issuers control
means the instrument is not indexed to the issuer s own stock. Accordingly, the Company determined that the conversion prices
of these notes were not a fixed amount because they were subject to an adjustment based on the occurrence of future offerings or
events. In addition, since the number of shares to be issued is not explicitly limited, the Company is unable to conclude that
enough authorized and unissued shares were available to share settle the conversion option. As a result, the Company determined
that the conversion features of the notes were not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and characterized the fair
value of the conversion features as derivative liabilities upon issuance. The Company determined that upon issuance of the notes
in 2015, the initial fair value of the embedded conversion feature was $532,000. As such, the Company recorded a $532,000 derivative
liability, of which $305,000 was recorded as debt discount offsetting the fair value of the notes and the remainder of $226,000
was recorded as a financing cost in 2015. The discount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the life
of the debt instruments. The unamortized balance of the debt discount was $79,000 as of December 31, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company amortized to interest expense, $79,000 of the remaining debt discount. In addition, the Company also recorded
and paid additional interest of $55,000 due to the default of certain of these notes. 

Note 7   Convertible Notes Payable
to Related Party  

In July 2015, the Company issued its convertible
promissory notes to Alex Bafer, Chairman and former CEO in exchange for the cancellation of previously issued promissory notes
in the aggregate of $555,000 and accrued interest of $13,000 for a total of $543,000. The notes are unsecured, bear interest of
5% per annum, matured on October 1, 2015 and are convertible to shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the lowest
20-day stock price prior to conversion with a 50% discount. 

The Company considered the current FASB guidance
of  Contracts in Entity s Own Stock  which indicates that any adjustment to the fixed amount (either conversion
price or number of shares) of the instrument regardless of the probability of whether or not within the issuer s control
means the instrument is not indexed to the issuer s own stock. Accordingly, the Company determined that the conversion prices
of the notes were not a fixed amount because they were subject to an adjustment based on the occurrence of future offerings or
events. In addition, since the number of shares to be issued is not explicitly limited, the Company is unable to conclude that
enough authorized and unissued shares are available to share settle the conversion option. As a result, the Company determined
that the conversion features of the notes were not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and characterized the fair
value of the conversion features as derivative liabilities upon issuance. The Company determined that upon issuance of the convertible
notes in 2015, the initial fair value of the embedded conversion feature was $1.5 million. The Company determined that the cancellation
of the previously issued promissory notes in exchange for the convertible notes issued in 2015 was an extinguishment of debt, and
the fair value of the derivative liability of $1.5 million was created upon the exchange of debt instruments and was accounted
as a debt extinguishment cost during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In October 2015, the notes matured and became
past due. As a result, the stated interest of 5% increased to 22% pursuant to the term of the notes. As of December 31, 2015, total
outstanding note balance amounted to $543,000 and accrued interest of $42,000. 

In July 2016, the Company and Mr. Bafer agreed
to extend the maturity date of these notes to August 1, 2017 and cure the default. There were no other terms changed and no additional
compensation paid. 

During the period ended September 30, 2016,
Mr. Bafer converted principal balance of $9,000 to 35 million shares of common stock. In addition, the Company paid Mr. Bafer $100,000
and accrued interest of $66,000. As of September 30, 2016, total outstanding note balance amounted to $434,000 and accrued interest
of $108,000. 

Note 8 - Derivative Liability  

The FASB has issued authoritative
guidance whereby instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments.
Certain warrants issued to investors and conversion features of notes payable do not have fixed settlement provisions
because their exercise prices will be lowered if the Company issues securities at lower prices in the future. In addition, since
the number of shares to be issued is not explicitly limited, the Company is unable to conclude that enough authorized and unissued
shares are available to share settle the conversion option. In accordance with the FASB authoritative guidance, the conversion
feature of the notes was separated from the host contract (i.e., the notes) and the fair value of the warrants have been recognized
as a derivative and will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement
of operations. 

The Company had four convertible notes payable,
five convertible notes payable to a related party and warrants to purchase a total of 561,250 shares of common stock as of September
30, 2016 that were accounted for as derivative liability. The derivative liability was valued at the following dates using a probability
based weighted-average Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following average assumptions: 

The risk-free interest rate was based on rates
established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Company uses the historical volatility of its common stock to estimate the future
volatility for its common stock. The expected life of the derivative securities was determined by the remaining contractual life
of the derivative instrument. For derivative instruments that already matured, the Company used the estimated life. The expected
dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends to its common stockholders in the past and does not
expect to pay dividends to its common stockholders in the future. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded a gain of $389,000 upon the extinguishment of derivative liabilities related to the payment and conversion
of certain convertible notes, and a gain of $3,826,000 relating to the change in the fair value of the derivatives during the period.
As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate fair value of the derivative liabilities was $8,110,000. 

Note 9 - Stockholders  Deficit  

Issuance of Preferred Stock   

During the period from January 1,
2016 to June 30, 2016, Mr. Tarek Kirschen, the Company s Chief Executive Officer at that time, made non-interest bearing
advances of $354,000 to the Company. In addition, the Company also accrued payroll of $85,000 pursuant to Mr. Kirschen s
employment agreement. In June 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 of Preferred A shares and 1,000,000 of Preferred B shares to Mr.
Kirschen as settlement for advances made by him and his accrued payroll in the aggregate amount of $439,000. The holder of Preferred
A shares is entitled to 100 votes per Preferred A share with no dividend rights and the Preferred A shares are not convertible
to common shares. The Preferred B shares are convertible into 2 common shares per each Preferred B share, and the holder of Preferred
B shares is entitled to 1 vote per Preferred B share, with no dividend rights. Concurrent with the settlement, Mr. Kirschen sold
the 5,000,000 Preferred A shares issued to him to South Centre, Inc. ( South Centre ), a firm owned by an unrelated
individual, Mr. David Cohen, for $150,000. As a result of this sale, Mr. Cohen gained control of the Company and became its Chief
Executive Officer. 

In July 2016, the Company entered
into a Redemption and Issuance Agreement by and between the Company and South Centre. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company redeemed
2,500,000 shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock from South Centre in exchange for 12,750,000 shares of Series
C Preferred Stock. The Preferred C shares are convertible to 2 common shares per Preferred C share and each Preferred C share is
entitled to 1 vote, with no dividend rights. The Company determined the fair value of the 2,500,000 Series A shares redeemed to
be $75,000, or $0.03 per share, which was the price paid by Mr. Cohen when he bought the Series A shares in June 2016. The Company
determined that fair value the 12,750,000 Series C shares issued to be $586,000, or $0.046 per share, pursuant to a valuation performed
for the Recall acquisition (see Note 3). As a result of this exchange agreement, the Company recorded compensation expense of $512,000
to account for the difference between the fair value of the 2,500,000 Series A shares redeemed and the 12,750,000 Series C shares
issued to South Centre. 

In July 2016, the Company
granted 1,993,750 per statement of stockholder s deficit shares of Preferred C Stock with a fair value of $92,000 for
consulting and legal services rendered, which was recorded as part of Operating Expenses in the accompanying Statements of
Operations. 

In July 2016, the Company issued 510,000 shares
of Preferred A Stock with a fair value of $15,000 to Mr. Alex Bafer pursuant to his appointment as Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

Deposit on Future Sale of Equity   

During the period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Recall sold 562,500 shares of Recall s common stock for total proceeds of $225,000.
These common shares were not included in the purchase agreement when the Company acquired Recall in July 2016. 

The Company is in the process of converting
these 562,500 shares of Recall common stock to the Company s Series C stock pursuant to the original terms of its acquisition
of Recall.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Unless
otherwise indicated, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to  we,   us,  and  our 
are to the Company, unless the context requires otherwise. The following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim financial statements and
the accompanying related notes included in this Quarterly Report and our audited financial statements and related notes and Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   

Overview   

We
were incorporated on February 20, 2009, in the State of Florida, under the name York Entertainment, Inc. On October 5, 2010, we
amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Brick Top Productions, Inc. Effective December 31, 2014, we amended
our articles of incorporation to change our name to Carolco Pictures, Inc.  

We
are an award-winning feature film and television specials production company. We seek to finance, produce and distribute one or
more television series and feature films to be licensed for exploitation in domestic and international theatrical, television,
cable, home video and pay per view markets.  

Through
our subsidiary, High Five Entertainment, we specialize in the development and presentation of quality television programming including
live events and award shows.  

Through
Recall, our subsidiary that we acquired in July 2016, we focus on Virtual Reality content, filling the demand attendant to the
increased production of virtual reality viewing devices absent a corresponding increase in content production. Founded by business,
media and entertainment industry leaders to meet growing demand for virtual reality and augmented reality content, Recall operates
within the convergence of immersive content and software. Recall will allow consumers to create and share interactive experiences
across all platforms. Combining modern business strategy with industry experience by bringing together highly trained relative
newcomers and entertainment industry stalwarts to create low risk, high profit and artistically acclaimed feature film virtual
reality and television projects, the Company and its subsidiaries are analyzing profitability across myriad entertainment sectors.  

Management s
Plan   

The
business side of our management team is disciplined in financial risk mitigation techniques. Aside from the commercialization
of our management team s past successes, which cannot in themselves necessarily predict future success, we are experienced
at balancing projects, budgets and growth to effectively manage risk in light of our business objectives.  

We
believe that we have unique access to Hollywood talent, scripts and third parties ripe for acquisition. We believe that the reputation
of our management team in producing some of the most-well known, talked about and socially ingrained entertainment opens doors
for us that are closed to others.  

We
believe we represent a new model in entertainment industry profitability. We intend to focus on growth and efficiency. Our development
plan combines modern business strategy with old-fashioned industry experience. Our early acquisition, High Five Entertainment,
has given us highly regarded, industry leading talent. We have matched that talent with new and existing property development.
By targeting additional revenue positive entertainment projects and companies, we expect to achieve increased profitability and
efficiency through scale.  

We
believe that our management team s reputation, contacts and experience give us a competitive edge. However, the market for
productions currently is, and is expected to continue to be, extremely competitive. Our competitors include many companies that
have substantially greater financial, management, marketing resources and experience than us. There can be no assurance that our
productions will be competitive with other motion pictures or television shows, or that we will be able to achieve or maintain
profitability.  

Recent
Developments   

On
June 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) by and between the Company, Tarek Kirschen,
the then-Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company and South Centre, a firm owned solely by David Cohen, a then-unrelated
individual.   The SPA provided that the Company
would issue to Mr. Kirschen 5,000,000 shares of newly designated Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per
share (the  Series A Stock ), in exchange for the payment to the Company of $500, which would thereafter be sold by
Mr. Kirschen to South Centre for $150,000. Mr. Cohen thereby became the controlling shareholder of the Company.  

The
SPA, as amended pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the SPA, executed on June 24, 2016, provided that the closing of the transactions
thereunder (the  Closing ) would occur upon satisfaction of all conditions precedent, including the issuance of the
shares of Series A Stock and the issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company, the delivery of certain documents
to evidence the valid issuance of the Series A Stock to Mr. Kirschen, the execution and delivery of certain additional documents,
including the Release and Issuance Agreement as discussed below, and certain other customary closing conditions. All such conditions
were satisfied and the transactions under the SPA closed on June 27, 2016.  

On
June 22, 2016, in connection with and as required by the SPA, the Company entered into a Release and Issuance Agreement by and
between Mr. Kirschen, the Company, Alexander Bafer, a former officer and shareholder of the Company, and South Centre (the  Release
Agreement ). Pursuant to the Release Agreement, effective as of the Closing, (i) Mr. Kirschen released all claims that he
may have against the Company, Mr. Bafer and their respective related parties; and (ii) Mr. Bafer released all claims that he may
have against Mr. Kirschen and his related parties.  

In
the Release Agreement, the Company also agreed to issue to Mr. Kirschen 5,000,000 shares of Series A Stock, and 1,000,000 shares
of newly designated Series B Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Series B Stock ), and
Mr. Kirschen agreed to forgive $438,767.35 that was owed by the Company to Mr. Kirschen (the  Debt ). The transactions
under the Release Agreement closed concurrently with the Closing under the SPA, on June 27, 2016. Upon the Closing, Mr. Cohen
was named a director and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  

On
July 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Amendment to Promissory Notes ( Notes Amendment ) with Alexander Bafer
pursuant to which   the maturity date of each of
our five loans from Mr. Bafer was amended to be August 1, 2017 instead of October 1, 2015. The five loans are represented by Replacement
Convertible Promissory Notes ( Notes ). Pursuant to the terms of the Notes Amendment, Mr. Bafer waived any default
under each of the Notes through the date of the Notes Amendment as a result of any amounts payable under the Notes not being paid
as of October 1, 2015 and waived the payment of any Default Interest (as defined in the Notes) through the date of the Notes Amendment
as a result of such failure of payment. No other terms of the loans changed, and we did not pay any consideration for the extension.
Our outstanding balance on the loans under the Notes as of July 20, 2016 was approximately $468,662.  

On
July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Redemption and Issuance Agreement (the  Redemption Agreement ) by and between
the Company and South Centre, Inc., an entity owned and controlled by David Cohen, the Company s sole director (at the time)
and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, on the same date, the Company redeemed 2,500,000 shares of
the Company s Series A Preferred Stock (the  Series A Stock ) in exchange for the payment to South Centre of
$0.0001 per share, for a total consideration of $250. The Company undertook the redemption for the purposes of obtaining the shares
of Series A Stock so that such shares could be paid to certain third parties in connection with the Contribution Agreement as
disclosed below.  

Also
pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, on the same date, the Company issued to South Centre 12,750,000 shares of newly designated
Series C Preferred Stock of the Company (the  Series C Stock ) in exchange for payment to the Company of $1,275.  

On
July 25, 2016, the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement (the  Contribution Agreement ) by and between the
Company, Recall, South Centre and various other shareholders of Recall (the  Recall Shareholders ).  

In
July 2016, the Company raised approximately $416,000 through the issuance of 487,000 shares of Recall s common stock. The
Company and the purchasers of these common stock are currently in negotiations to convert the 487,000 shares of Recall common
stock to the Company s Series C Preferred Stock.  

The
Contribution Agreement provided that the Recall Shareholders would contribute to the Company all of the shares of Recall held
by the Recall Shareholders, which would result in Recall becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In return for the
contributions by the Recall Shareholders, the Company issued to the Recall Shareholders 25,256,250 shares of Series C Stock and
2,500,000 shares of the Series A Stock, that were redeemed by the Company from South Centre, as described above. The transactions
under the Contribution Agreement closed on July 25, 2016.  

Recall
focuses on Virtual Reality content. Founded by business, media and entertainment industry leaders to meet growing demand for Virtual
Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) content, that Recall is the future of new media entertainment and technology. Operating
within the convergence of immersive content and software, Recall is allowing consumers to create and share interactive experiences
across all platforms through its production of content and software permitting consumer based editing of non-linear content.  

The
Contribution Agreement provided that upon the closing of the transactions in the Contribution Agreement, the Company would enter
into employment agreements with (i) Bradley Albert as President and Chief Creative Officer of the Company, (ii) Justin Morris
as Chief Operating Officer of the Company and (iii) Alexander Bafer as Chief Development Officer of the Company.  

Upon
the closing of the transactions, the Company entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Albert, Mr. Morris and Mr. Bafer
which commenced simultaneously with the closing of the transactions under the Contribution Agreement, on July 25, 2016.  

The
Company en tered into a Chairman Agreement with Alexander Bafer (the  Chairman Agreement )
on July 25, 2016, pursuant to which Mr. Bafer was named to the Board and also named Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to the Chairman
Agreement, on the effective date thereof the Company issued to Mr. Bafer 510,000 shares of Series A Stock of the Company, which
shares were immediately vested.   

On
July 25, 2016, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Company issued 1,990,000 shares of Series A Stock and 25,256,250 shares
of Series C Stock to the Recall Shareholders in exchange for the contribution to the Company by the Recall Shareholders (collectively)
of 25,256,250 shares of common stock of Recall, and 748,334 shares of Class A Preferred Stock of Recall, collectively constituting
100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Recall.  

At
the option of the holder thereof, each share of Series C Stock is convertible into two shares of common stock of the Company (the
 Common Stock ) provided that this option is not exercisable until there are sufficient shares of Common Stock authorized
for the conversion of all of the Series C Stock. There is no adjustment to the conversion ratio in the event of a reverse stock
split of the common stock or for any other reason.  

In
addition to the above, on the closing of the transaction with Recall, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series C Stock to
Harrison Smith (a former shareholder of Recall) and 993,750 shares of Series C Stock to Frank Esposito (an advisor to the Company)
in consideration of services rendered to the Company in connection with the Contribution Agreement and the transactions therein.  

The
issuances of the Series A Stock and the Series C Stock to the Recall Shareholders were completed pursuant to exemptions from registrations
provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and Rule 506 of Regulation
D under the Securities Act.  

In
addition, as discussed above, pursuant to the Employment Agreement with Mr. Bafer, on the commencement of his employment term,
the Company issued to Mr. Bafer 510,000 shares of Series A Stock of the Company, which shares were immediately vested.  

On
July 21, 2016, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to designate a new series of preferred stock, the Series C Preferred
Stock (the  Series C Stock ) to be utilized in the transactions described above.  40,000,000
shares were designated as Series C Stock.   

The
Company hired a valuation specialist to assist the Company in the determination of the value of the acquisition. As of the date
of this report, the Company is still in the process of finalizing the valuation and the allocation of the purchase price.  

From
April 2016 through September 2016, the Company issued 243,540,999 share of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and
accrued interest in the aggregate of $144,000.  

On
June 29, 2016, Carolco Pictures, Inc. (the  Company ), entered into a letter agreement with Esposito Partners, PLLC
( Esposito Partners ), pursuant to which the Company engaged Esposito Partners to provide legal services to the Company
(the  Agreement ). T  he Agreement
provides for a one-time fee payable to Esposito Partners in the amount of $60,000, which the Company may elect to pay by the delivery
of stock of the Company.  The Agreement also provides that Frank Esposito, the Managing Member
of Esposito Partners, shall be named as a Director of the Company and shall also serve as the Company s Chief Legal Officer
and Secretary.   

Private
Unit Offering   

In
March 2015, we commenced an offering to sell to certain accredited investors up to 31,250,000 units (each, a  Unit )
at a price per Unit of $0.50, with each Unit consisting of one share of our common stock, one Class A Common Stock Purchase Warrant
(the  Class A Warrant ) and one Class B Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the  Class B Warrant ). Each Class
A Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share for a period of
two years after its issuance and each Class B Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise
price of $6.00 per share for a period of two years after its issuance. The minimum investment amount per investor is $100,000
for 125,000 Units subject to our right to accept subscriptions in a lesser amount. We plan to invest up to $4,000,000 of the proceeds
from this offering to partially finance the production of a motion picture based on the screenplay titled  Audition 
written by film director, Richard Gray. In addition, we plan to continue use the balance of the offering proceeds in our feature
film and television production business.  

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 146,000 and $366,000, respectively. The decrease of $220,000 is due
to the slowdown in production activities during the change in the Company s ownership in June 2016.  

Cost
of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $76,000 and $286,000, respectively. The decrease of
$210,000 is directly related to the decrease of approximately 60% in revenues, which was due to the change in the Company s
ownership in June 2016.  

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1,301,000, compared to $148,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase of approximately $1,153,000 was primarily attributable to $276,000 in amortization expense related to intangible
assets, an increase of $752,000 in compensation expenses due to new employment contracts under the new Company s ownership,
and an increase of $149,000 in professional fees.  

The
Company realized a loss before non-controlling interest of $707,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
a loss before non-controlling interest of $984,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This improvement was primarily
due to a gain of $379,000 related to the change in value of derivative liabilities on warrants and convertible notes issued by
the Company.  

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $176,000, as compared to $769,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease in revenue of $593,000 was due to the slowdown in production activities during 2016 due to the change in Company s
ownership.  

Cost
of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $80,000, as compared to $623,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Cost of goods sold was significantly lower than prior year due to lower revenues between the periods of approximately
73% due to the pause in operations because of the change in ownership during 2016.  

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1,573,000, compared to $1,054,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase of approximately $519,000 was primarily attributable to $276,000 in amortization expense related to intangible
assets, and an increase of $527,000 in compensation expenses due to new employment contracts under the Company s new ownership.  

The
Company has realized a loss before non-controlling interest of $5,103,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to a loss before non-controlling interest of $1,946,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This loss increase of $3,157,000
was primarily due to $3,826,000 related to the charge for the change in value of derivative liabilities on warrants and convertible
notes issued by the Company.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, our assets totaled $1,384,000, our liabilities totaled $9,480,000 and we had negative working capital of
$9,229,000.  

Pursuant
to the terms of our employment agreement with Mr. Bafer, we were obligated to pay Mr. Bafer $150,000 per year. On October 1, 2011,
Mr. Bafer agreed to waive future base salary under his employment agreement, until further notice, in an effort to reduce our
operating expenses. Prior to that time, we did not have sufficient cash flows to make the required payments under the employment
agreement and therefore, accrued all unpaid salary until such time we generate revenues from operations or raise additional capital
through one or more financing transactions. Accrued salaries due Mr. Bafer totaled $125,000 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.  

As
part of the Company s acquisition of S G Holdings, Inc. (doing business as High Five Entertainment) ( S G )
in December 2013, the Company entered into an executive employment agreement with Mr. Martin Fischer, pursuant to which Mr. Fischer
will serve as S G s president for an initial term of five years with an initial base salary of $144,000. He will also
be entitled to an annual bonus of up to $100,000 based on performance and a monthly car allowance of $500. In addition, the Company
awarded Mr. Fischer an option to purchase 1,491,351 shares of common stock, exercisable at $0.01 per share, which vested throughout
2014.  

We
have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our Company is dependent upon our attaining and maintaining
profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard, we have raised additional capital through equity
offerings and loan transactions. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of debt and
equity securities for cash to operate its business. We do not currently have any additional third party financing available in
the form of loans, advances, or commitments. Our officers and shareholders have not made any written or oral agreement to provide
us additional financing. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will
be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue
restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity
financing.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material
current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, and which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $8,096,000 at September
30, 2016, and incurred a net loss of $5,103,000, and utilized net cash used in operating activities $302,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.  

In
addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s December 31,
2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to execute its strategy and
in its ability to raise additional funds. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of
equity securities for cash to operate its business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional
financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for
our stock holders, in case or equity financing. Management estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue
operations through December 31, 2016.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
have identified the following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted
by the application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments.
These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact
quarterly or annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly
as expected, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies
are described in the following paragraphs.  

Non-Controlling
Interest.  The Company reports the non-controlling interest in its majority owned subsidiaries in the consolidated balance
sheets within the equity section, separately from the Company s stockholders  equity. Non-controlling interest represents
the non-controlling interest holders  proportionate share of the equity of the Company s majority-owned subsidiaries.
Non-controlling interest is adjusted for the non-controlling interest holders  proportionate share of the earnings or losses
and other comprehensive income (loss) and the non-controlling interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if
that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments.  The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or
contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities,
the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in
the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a
probability weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton models to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation
dates through the December 31, 2015, reporting date. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.  

Stock-Based
Compensation.  The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising
transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting
to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant
and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option
and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value
of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment
is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options and warrants
granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective
period. As the options and warrants vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference
between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are
no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option and warrant grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based
compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. The fair value of the Company s stock option and
warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free
interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense
is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The
assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future
periods.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

See
Note 2 in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting policies.  

Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012  

The
JOBS Act permits an  emerging growth company  such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply
with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected
to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an  emerging growth company. 
This election will permit us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that will have different effective dates
for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Consequently, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our CEO and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and principal financial officer, an evaluation
was performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and principal financial officer,
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report due
to the Company s limited resources and limited number of employees. To mitigate the current limited resources and limited
employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of legal and outsourced accounting
professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which, we believe, will enable us to implement adequate
segregation of duties within the internal control framework.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

The
Company may be involved in certain legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Except
for income tax contingencies (commencing April 1, 2009), the Company records accruals for contingencies to the extent that management
concludes that the occurrence is probable and that the related amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated
with the contingency are expensed as incurred.  

The
Company is not currently engaged in any legal proceedings, however, the Company received a letter dated April 26, 2016 from Studiocanal
S.A. ( Studiocanal ) and another letter dated December 1, 2016 from counsel representing Studiocanal claiming that
Studiocanal owns common law rights to certain marks currently being used by the Company. Such marks were previously registered
by a company that has been defunct since 1996. In addition, Studiocanal and its counsel claim that Studiocanal owns all right,
title and interest in and to the catalogue of television programs and films that were produced and distributed by that defunct
company, including the Rambo franchise, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Basic Instinct and Total Recall. The December 2016 letter
states that the use of trademarks and copyrighted images by the Company constitutes infringement of intellectual property rights,
a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, false advertising, unfair competition, misappropriation of trademarks and
trademark dilution.  

Studiocanal s
counsel requested that the Company cease and desist from use of such marks and material and relinquish trademark registrations
legally obtained by the Company. Following receipt of the April 2016 letter, the Company responded and discussions were held between
representatives of the Company and Studiocanal. The Company has not yet responded to the December 2016 letter. As of the date
hereof, the Company is not aware of any legal proceeding having been brought by Studiocanal.
