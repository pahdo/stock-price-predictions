  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

1. 
    Nature of Operations 
       
  Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas primarily in its core areas in Texas and New Mexico.  Unless the context otherwise requires, references to  CWEI  mean Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., the parent company, and references to  the Company,   we,   us  or  our  mean Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Approximately   17.8%   of CWEI s outstanding common stock, is beneficially owned by Clayton W. Williams, Jr. ( Mr. Williams ), Chairman of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and approximately   17.4%   is owned by a partnership in which Mr. Williams  adult children are limited partners, and Mel G. Riggs, our President, is the sole general partner. 
    
  Substantially all of our oil and gas production is sold under short-term contracts, which are market-sensitive.  Accordingly, our results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas.  These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control.  These factors include the level of global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainties, weather conditions, domestic governmental regulations and taxes, political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, price and availability of alternative fuels, and overall domestic and foreign economic conditions. 

2. 
    Presentation 
       
  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CWEI and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  We account for our undivided interests in oil and gas limited partnerships using the proportionate consolidation method.  Under this method, we consolidate our proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of such limited partnerships.  Less than   5%   of our consolidated total assets and total revenues are derived from oil and gas limited partnerships.  Substantially all intercompany transactions and balances associated with the consolidated operations have been eliminated.  
    
  In the opinion of management, our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP.  These interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The objective of the standard is to reduce the existing diversity in practice of several cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payment made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on retrospective basis.  We are currently evaluating the method of adoption and impact this standard may have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as certain classification changes in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Upon adoption, we expect to record a cumulative-effect adjustment to reclassify approximately   $7.5 million   of excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced taxes payable.  We plan to adopt ASU 2016-09 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to be effective as of January 1, 2017. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).   The main difference between the current requirement under GAAP and ASU 2016-02 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases.  ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease).  The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments.  The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs.  For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance.  Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases).  Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting.  For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.  ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients.  Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.  We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes.   This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current on the balance sheet.  The standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption will be permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  This standard may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented.  Adoption of the new guidance will affect the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   This ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires net debt issuance costs directly related to our senior notes and our second lien term loan to be classified as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related senior notes and second lien term loan.  We adopted this ASU as of March 31, 2016 and reclassified   $7.3 million   of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015 from a non-current asset to a direct deduction in long-term debt.  The debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility remains classified as a non-current asset due to the revolving nature of that facility. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances.  The standard is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2014-15 and do not anticipate any impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.  The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,  which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  That new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, which rescinds guidance from the SEC on accounting for gas balancing arrangements and will eliminate the use of the entitlements method.  An entity can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements.  We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

    Long-Term Debt 
       
  Long-term debt consists of the following: 

Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  We may borrow money under a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of   16   banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  On March 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility in connection with the Refinancing (as defined below) (see           Term Loan Credit Facility   ).  The amendment, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and aggregate commitments of the lenders from   $450 million   to   $100 million  .  The aggregate commitments may be increased to   $150 million   if we meet a minimum ratio of the discounted present value of our proved developed producing reserves to our debt under the revolving credit facility of   1.2   to   1.0  .  Increases in aggregate lender commitments require the consent of each lender. 
    
  The amendment also increased the applicable interest rates under our revolving credit facility by   0.75%   at every borrowing base utilization level.  At our election, interest under the revolving credit facility is determined by reference to (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin between   2.5%   and   3.5%   per year or (2) the greatest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus   0.5%   or (C) one-month LIBOR plus   1%   plus, in any of (A), (B) or (C), an applicable margin between   1.5%   and   2.5%   per year.  We are also required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the revolving credit facility of   0.5%   per year.  The applicable margin is determined based on the utilization of the borrowing base.  Interest and fees are payable quarterly, except that interest on LIBOR-based tranches is due at maturity of each tranche but no less frequently than quarterly. 
    
  The revolving credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens.  One such covenant requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of at least   1   to   1  .  The   March 2016   amendment replaced a requirement that we maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a less restrictive ratio of debt outstanding solely under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX to be less than   2.0   to   1.0  .

     Table of Contents  
  CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The revolving credit facility matures in   April 2019   and is subject to an accelerated maturity date of   October 1, 2018   unless our existing   7.75%   Senior Notes due 2019 (the  2019 Senior Notes ) are refinanced or extended in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility prior to   October 1, 2018  .  
    
  The borrowing base, which is based on the discounted present value of future net cash flows from oil and gas production, is redetermined by the banks semi-annually in May and November.  We or the banks may also request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year.  If, at any time, the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility, we will be required to (1) provide additional security, (2) prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficiency, (3) prepay the deficiency in not more than   five   equal monthly installments plus accrued interest, or (4) take any combination of options (1) through (3).  
    
  The revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least   90%   of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the revolving credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests evaluated in determining the borrowing base.  The obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI s material restricted domestic subsidiaries. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $98.1 million   available under the revolving credit facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling   $1.9 million  .  The effective annual interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, excluding bank fees and amortization of debt issue costs, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   2.5%  .  We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The failure to comply with the foregoing covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the revolving credit facility.  Other events of default under the revolving credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority.  The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding. 
    
  Term Loan Credit Facility 
    
  On   March 8, 2016  , we entered into the term loan credit facility with funds managed by Ares Management, LLC ( Ares ) providing for the lenders to make secured term loans to us in the principal amount of   $350 million   (the  Refinancing ).  As part of the Refinancing, we issued warrants to purchase   2,251,364   shares of our common stock at a price of   $22.00   per share and required certain amendments to the revolving credit facility.  The term loans were issued at an original issue discount of   $16.8 million  , which amount equaled the cash consideration received by us for the issuance of the related warrants and shares of special voting preferred stock.  Aggregate cash proceeds from the Refinancing of approximately   $340 million  , net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the then-outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility of   $160 million  , plus accrued interest and fees.   
    
  The warrants expire in 2026 and contain various anti-dilution provisions.  Pursuant to FASB ASC 815-40, we account for the warrants as derivative instruments and carry the warrants as a non-current liability at their fair value, with the calculated increase or decrease in fair value each quarter being recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss (see Note 10).  The warrants had a fair value of   $16.8 million   at the date of issuance and a fair value of   $171.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  As a result, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a loss on revaluation of the warrant liability of   $123.4 million   and   $155 million  , respectively. 
    
  Interest on the term loans is payable quarterly in cash at   12.5%   per year; however, during the period from March 15, 2016 through March 31, 2018, we may elect to pay interest for any quarter in-kind at   15%   per year.  We paid interest for the period commencing from   March 15, 2016   and ending   March 31, 2016   in cash and elected to pay interest for the quarters ended   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2016   in-kind.  In August 2016, we elected to pay interest for the quarterly period ending December 31, 2016 in cash.  Future quarterly elections to pay in-kind must be made at least 30 days prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter.  
    
  The term loan credit facility matures on   March 15, 2021  , but is subject to an earlier maturity on   December 31, 2018  , if we do not extend or refinance our existing 2019 Senior Notes on or prior to that date.

The term loan credit facility is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least   90%   of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the term loan credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests.  The obligations under the term loan credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI s material restricted domestic subsidiaries.  Optional and mandatory prepayments made prior to   September 15, 2020   are subject to make-whole or prepayment premiums.  
    
  The term loan credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens.  One such covenant requires that we maintain an asset-to-secured debt coverage ratio as of each   December 31   and   June 30   of each year, beginning with   December 31, 2018  , of at least   1.2   to   1.0  .  We were in compliance with all covenants at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  The failure to comply with these covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the term loan credit facility.  Other events of default under the term loan credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority.

  On   July 22, 2016  , we entered into an agreement to sell   5,051,100   shares of common stock to funds managed by Ares for cash proceeds of   $150 million  , or approximately   $29.70   per share (the  Private Placement ) which transaction closed on   August 29, 2016  .  In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into an amendment to the term loan facility, waiving certain restrictions to enable us to use proceeds from equity issuances and specified asset sales for debt reduction and capital expenditures.  
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  In March 2011, we issued   $300 million   of aggregate principal amount of 2019 Senior Notes.  The 2019 Senior Notes, which are unsecured, were issued at par and bear interest at   7.75%   per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year.  In April 2011, we issued an additional   $50 million   aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes with an original issue discount of   1%   or   $0.5 million  .  In October 2013, we issued an additional   $250 million   of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes at par to yield   7.75%   to maturity.  All of the 2019 Senior Notes are treated as a single class of debt securities under the same indenture (the  Indenture ).  In August 2016, we redeemed   $100 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes in a tender offer and for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   recorded a   $4 million     gain   on early extinguishment of long-term debt, consisting of a   $5 million   discount and a   $1 million   write-off of debt issuance costs.  We may redeem some or all of the remaining 2019 Senior Notes at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) equal to   100%   beginning on April 1, 2017 or for any period thereafter, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  The Indenture contains covenants that restrict our ability to:  (1) borrow money; (2) issue redeemable or preferred stock; (3) pay distributions or dividends; (4) make investments; (5) create liens without securing the 2019 Senior Notes; (6) enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; (7) sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies; (8) enter into transactions with affiliates; (9) guarantee indebtedness; and (10) enter into new lines of business.  One such covenant generally restricts our ability to incur indebtedness if our ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense (as these terms are defined in the Indenture) is less than   2.25   times.  However, this restriction does not prevent us from incurring indebtedness under a credit facility (as defined in the Indenture) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (a)   $500 million   and (b)   30%   of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Indenture).  These covenants are subject to a number of additional important exceptions and qualifications as described in the Indenture.  We were in compliance with these covenants at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

    Sales of Assets 
       
  In September 2016, we sold certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for cash consideration of   $1.4 million  .  In July 2016, we sold our interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas for approximately   $19.4 million  , subject to customary post-closing adjustments.  In June 2016, we sold our interests in certain wells in Oklahoma for cash consideration of   $1.5 million  .  In April 2016, we sold certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for cash consideration of   $2 million  .  This acreage was sold under a one-year term assignment as long as the buyer maintains a 180-day continuous development program on the acreage.  In February 2016, we sold certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for cash consideration of   $0.8 million  .  Net proceeds from these transactions were used to repay the then-outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to fund a portion of our planned capital expenditures for 2016.

In September 2015, we sold our interests in selected leases in South Louisiana for   $11.8 million   subject to customary closing adjustments.  In June 2015, we sold certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for cash consideration of   $22.1 million  .  We retained our rights to all depths and formations other than the Eagle Ford formation and also retained our interest in acreage and production associated with the Porter E Unit #1, our only Eagle Ford well situated on this acreage, a reversionary interest in acreage if the buyer fails to maintain a continuous development program and an overriding royalty interest in leases to the extent the net revenue interest exceeds   75%  .  During the first half of 2015, we sold our interests in selected leases in Oklahoma and sold our interests in certain wells in Martin and Yoakum Counties, Texas for proceeds totaling   $7.3 million  .  Net proceeds from each of these transactions were applied to reduce indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 

5. 
    Asset Retirement Obligations 
       
  We record asset retirement obligations ( ARO ) associated with the retirement of our long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred and become determinable.  Under this method, we record a liability for the expected future cash outflows discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate for the dismantlement and abandonment costs, excluding salvage values, of each oil and gas property.  We also record an asset retirement cost to the oil and gas properties equal to the ARO liability.  The fair value of the asset retirement cost and the ARO liability is measured using primarily Level 3 inputs.  The significant unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement include estimates of plugging, abandonment and remediation costs, inflation rate and well life.  The inputs are calculated based on historical data as well as current estimated costs.  Accretion of the liability is recognized each period using the interest method of allocation, and the capitalized cost is depleted over the useful life of the related asset.  
    
  The following table reflects the changes in ARO during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  :

    Deferred Revenue from Volumetric Production Payment 
       
  In March 2012, Southwest Royalties, Inc. ( SWR ), a wholly owned subsidiary of CWEI, completed the mergers of each of the   24   limited partnerships of which SWR was the general partner, into SWR, with SWR continuing as the surviving entity in the mergers.  To obtain the funds to finance the aggregate merger consideration, SWR entered into a volumetric production payment ( VPP ) with a third party for upfront cash proceeds of   $44.4 million   and deferred future advances aggregating   $4.7 million  .  Under the terms of the VPP, SWR conveyed to the third party a term overriding royalty interest covering approximately   725   MBOE of estimated future oil and gas production from certain properties derived from the mergers.  The scheduled volumes under the VPP relate to production months from March 2012 through December 2019 and were to be delivered to, or sold on behalf of, the third party free of all costs associated with the production and development of the underlying properties.  Once the scheduled volumes were delivered to the third party, the term overriding royalty interest would terminate.  SWR retained the obligation to prudently operate and produce the properties during the term of the VPP, and the third party assumed all risks associated with product prices.  As a result, the VPP was accounted for as a sale of reserves, with the sales proceeds being deferred and amortized into oil and gas sales as the scheduled volumes were produced.  The net proceeds from the VPP were recorded as a non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheets.  Deferred revenue from the VPP was amortized over the life of the VPP and recognized in oil and gas sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering   277   MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for   $13.7 million  .  The termination of the VPP was accounted for as a repurchase of reserves, with the repurchase price offsetting the non-current liability and the balance of the remaining non-current liability amortized over the original term of the VPP and recognized in oil and gas sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   no   further obligations under the VPP.

    Stockholders  Equity and Earnings Per Share 
       
  In   August 2016  , we completed the sale of   5,051,100   shares of our common stock to funds managed by Ares for cash proceeds of   $150 million   or approximately   $29.70   per share.  Net proceeds from the sale, after offering expenses of   $2.7 million  , were used to repay indebtedness and provide additional funds for general corporate purposes.  
    
  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share amounts have been computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share include the effect of potentially dilutive shares outstanding for the period.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   152,000   shares that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented.

    Compensation Plans 
       
  Long Term Incentive Plan 
    
  In   June 2016  , stockholders approved the Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (the  LTIP ), which was adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board in April 2016.  The LTIP was adopted in order to enable the Company to attract and retain highly qualified employees, directors and consultants and to provide equity-based compensation to those individuals that will align their interests with the interests of the Company s shareholders.  The LTIP provides for the granting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend-equivalent awards, other stock-based awards, cash awards, performance awards, and any combination of such awards.  A total of   1,400,000   shares of the Company s common stock have been reserved for issuance under the LTIP and are expected to consist of new shares of the Company.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , initial grants of awards under the LTIP were made as disclosed in the tables below.  
    
  Stock Options 
    
  All outstanding nonqualified and incentive stock options under the LTIP expire seven years from the date of grant and vest ratably over a three-year period.  The exercise price of stock options under the LTIP may not be less than the market value of the stock on the date of grant.  The fair value of the stock options on the date of grant is expensed ratably over the applicable vesting period.  The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires the Company to make certain assumptions, as follows: 
    
     Expected volatility of the underlying common stock is based on the Company s historical stock volatility; 

Expected term of options granted is based on the mid-point between the final vesting date and the expiration date since the Company does not have sufficient history to predict the expected term using historical data; and 
       
     Risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the expected term of the options at the date of grant.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our stock options as of   September 30, 2016  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the unrecognized compensation cost related to granted stock options was   $5.8 million  .  Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.9   years. 
    
  Restricted Stock Awards 
    
  Restricted stock awards granted under the LTIP as of   September 30, 2016   vest over either a   one  -year or   three  -year period.  The estimated fair value of restricted stock grants, computed based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, is expensed ratably over the applicable vesting period. 
    
  The following table presents our restricted stock activity as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The aggregate fair value of restricted stock awards granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $17.4 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , our unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock awards was   $16.7 million  .  Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.6   years. 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards was   $0.8 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   none   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Non-Equity Award Plans 
    
  The Compensation Committee of the Board has adopted an after-payout ( APO ) incentive plan (the  APO Incentive Plan ) for officers, key employees and consultants who promote our drilling and acquisition programs.  The Compensation Committee s objective in adopting this plan is to further align the interests of the participants with ours by granting the participants an APO interest in the production developed, directly or indirectly, through the efforts of the participants.  The plan generally provides for the creation of a series of partnerships or participation arrangements, which are treated as partnerships for tax purposes ( the APO Partnerships ), between us and the participants, to which we contribute a portion of our economic interest in wells drilled or acquired within certain areas.  Generally, we pay all costs to acquire, drill and produce applicable wells and receive all revenues until we have recovered all of our costs, plus interest ( payout ).  At payout, the participants receive   99%   to   100%   of all subsequent revenues and pay   99%   to   100%   of all subsequent expenses attributable to the economic interests that are subject to the APO Partnerships.  Between   5%   and   7.5%   of our economic interests in specified wells drilled or acquired by us subsequent to October 2002 are subject to the APO Incentive Plan.  We record our allocable share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and oil and gas reserves of these APO Partnerships in our consolidated financial statements.  Participants in the APO Incentive Plan are immediately vested in all future amounts payable under the plan. 
    
  The Compensation Committee has also adopted an APO reward plan (the  APO Reward Plan ) which offers eligible officers, key employees and consultants the opportunity to receive bonus payments that are based on certain profits derived from a portion of our working interest in specified areas where we are conducting drilling and production enhancement operations.  The wells subject to an APO Reward Plan are not included in the APO Incentive Plan.  Likewise, wells included in the APO Incentive Plan are not included in the APO Reward Plan.  Although conceptually similar to the APO Incentive Plan, the APO Reward Plan is a compensatory bonus plan through which we pay participants a bonus equal to a portion of the APO cash flows received by us from our working interest in wells in a specified area.  Unlike the APO Incentive Plan, however, participants in the APO Reward Plan are not immediately vested in all future amounts payable under the plan.  Through May 4, 2016, we have granted awards under the APO Reward Plan in   15   specified areas, each of which established a quarterly bonus amount equal to   7%   or   10%   of the APO cash flow from wells drilled or recompleted in the respective areas after the effective date set forth in each plan , which dates range from January 1, 2007 to June 11, 2014.   As of   June 23, 2016  , all   15   awards were fully vested.  On May 4, 2016, the Compensation Committee amended the definition of a well in each plan to end the inclusion of new wells in all plans.  A well is a well drilled by the employer in the area described provided that the well has a spud date between the effective date and May 4, 2016.  All other terms of the plan remain unchanged.  Future payments to participants in the plan will be based on the performance of only those wells that meet the revised definition of a well.  The Compensation Committee expects to utilize the LTIP in lieu of future grants under the APO Reward Plan. 
    
  In January 2007, we granted awards under the Southwest Royalties Reward Plan (the  SWR Reward Plan ), a one-time incentive plan which established a quarterly bonus amount for participants equal to the APO cash flow from a   22.50%   working interest in   one   well.  The plan is fully vested and   100%   of subsequent quarterly bonus amounts are payable to participants. 
    
  To continue as a participant in the APO Reward Plan or the SWR Reward Plan, participants must remain in the employment or service of the Company through the full vesting date established for each award.  The full vesting date may be accelerated in the event of a change of control or sale transaction, as defined in the plan documents. 
    
  We recognize compensation expense related to the APO Partnerships based on the estimated value of economic interests conveyed to the participants.  Estimated compensation expense applicable to the APO Reward Plan and the SWR Reward Plan is recognized over the applicable vesting periods, which range from   two years   to   five years  .  Compensation expense related to non-equity award plans for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $(1.1) million  ,   $(2) million   and   $7.2 million  ,   $6.6 million  , respectively.  Credits to expense resulted from the reversal of previously accrued compensation expense attributable to changes in estimates of future compensation expense.

    Derivatives 
       
  Commodity Derivatives 
    
  From time to time, we utilize commodity derivatives, consisting of swaps, floors and collars, to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and gas production.  When using swaps to hedge oil and natural gas production, we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract, generally New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) futures prices, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.  In floor transactions, we receive a fixed price (put strike price) if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity.  If the market price is greater than the put strike price, no payments are due from either party.  Costless collars are a combination of puts and calls, and contain a fixed floor price (put strike price) and ceiling price (call strike price).  If the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price.  If the market price is between the call and the put strike prices, no payments are due from either party.  Commodity derivatives are settled monthly as the contract production periods mature.  
    
  The following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .  Settlement prices of commodity derivatives are based on NYMEX futures prices.

Costless Collars: 

Accounting for Commodity Derivatives 
    
  We did not designate any of our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges; therefore, all changes in the fair value of these contracts prior to maturity, plus any realized gains or losses at maturity, were recorded as other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
       
  Cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities were each estimated to have a fair value approximating the carrying amount due to the short maturity of those instruments.  Indebtedness under the revolving credit facility is estimated to have a fair value approximating the carrying amount since the interest rate is generally market sensitive. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We follow a framework for measuring fair value, which outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.  Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties at the measurement date.  Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters.  Where observable prices or inputs are not available, use of unobservable prices or inputs are used to estimate the current fair value, often using an internal valuation model.  These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the item being valued.  We categorize our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. 
    
  Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows: 
    
           Level 1 -  
    Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
       
           Level 2 -  
    Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life. 
       
           Level 3 -  
    Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. 
       
  The financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were commodity derivatives and common stock warrants.   
    
  Common stock warrant liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis until the underlying common stock warrants are exercised (see Note 3).  We measure the fair value of the common stock warrant liabilities using the Black-Scholes method (Level 2 inputs).  Inputs used to determine fair value under this method include the Company s stock price volatility and expected remaining life.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
    
  We estimate the fair value of the 2019 Senior Notes using quoted market prices.  The fair value of our Second Lien Term Loan as of   September 30, 2016   is based upon our discounted cash flow model.  Fair value is compared to the carrying value in the table below: 

Our effective federal and state income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   18.3%   differed from the statutory federal rate of   35%   due primarily to permanent differences related to revaluation of the warrants issued in connection with the Refinancing, increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions. 
    
  CWEI and its subsidiaries file federal income tax returns with the United States Internal Revenue Service and state income tax returns in various state tax jurisdictions.  As a general rule, the Company s tax returns for fiscal years after 2012 currently remain subject to examination by appropriate taxing authorities.  None of our income tax returns are under examination at this time.

  Other operating revenues and expenses for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , gain on sales of assets included the sale of our interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas in July 2016 (see Note 4).  
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , gain on sales of assets included the sale of selected leases in South Louisiana in September 2015.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , gain on sales of assets included the sale of selected leases in South Louisiana in September 2015, the release of sales proceeds previously held in escrow pending resolution of title requirements associated with the sale of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014, the sale of leases in Oklahoma in May and June 2015 and the sale of selected wells in Martin and Yoakum Counties, Texas in March 2015(see Note 4). 
    
  We maintain an inventory of tubular goods and other well equipment for use in our exploration and development drilling activities.  Inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or estimated fair market value.  We categorize the measurement of fair value of inventory as Level 2 under applicable accounting standards.  To determine estimated fair value of inventory, we subscribe to market surveys and obtain quotes from equipment dealers for similar equipment.  We then correlate the data as needed to estimate the fair value of the specific items (or groups of similar items) in our inventory.  If the estimated fair values for those specific items (or groups of similar items) in our inventory are less than the related average cost, a provision for impairment is made.

    Investment in Dalea Investment Group, LLC 
       
  In June 2012, we cancelled an   $11 million   note receivable in exchange for a   7.66%   non-controlling membership interest in Dalea Investment Group, LLC ( Dalea ), an international oilfield services company formed in March 2012.  Since the membership interests in Dalea are privately-held and are not traded in an active market, our investment in Dalea was carried at the lower of its initial cost of   $11 million   and its estimated fair value based on a qualitative assessment.  We recorded   no   impairment on our investment in Dalea for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $8.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $0.5 million   and   $1.4 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , our investment in Dalea was fully impaired compared to an estimated fair value of   $8.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  We categorize the measurement of fair value of this investment as a Level 3 input.

  Legal Proceedings 
    
  In February 2012, BMT O G TX, L.P. filed a suit in the 143rd Judicial District in Reeves County, Texas to terminate a lease under our farm-in agreement with Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C. ( Chesapeake ).  Plaintiffs are the lessors and claim a breach of the lease which they allege gives rise to termination of the lease.  CWEI denies a breach and argues in the alternative that (i) any breach was cured in accordance with the lease and (ii) a breach will not give rise to lease termination.  In October 2013, a judge ruled that CWEI and Chesapeake are jointly and severally liable for damages to plaintiffs in the amount of approximately   $2.9 million   and attorney fees of   $0.8 million  .  A loss of   $1.4 million   was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 in connection with the judgment.  CWEI appealed the judgment and on July 8, 2015, the El Paso Court of Appeals reversed the trial court judgment in its entirety and rendered judgment that Plaintiffs take nothing on all claims against CWEI and Chesapeake.  Plaintiffs appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Texas Supreme Court, and on October 21, 2016, the Texas Supreme Court denied Plaintiffs  Petition for Review. 
    
  CWEI has been named a defendant in three lawsuits filed in Louisiana, one by Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East ( SELFPA ) and two by Plaquemines Parish, each alleging that historical industry operations have significantly damaged coastal marshlands. 
    
  In July 2013, the SELFPA case was filed in Orleans Parish and alleged that dredging and other oilfield operations of the 95 oil and gas company defendants caused degradation and destruction of the coastal marshlands which serve as a buffer protecting the coastal area of Louisiana from storms.  The case was removed to Federal District Court.  Legislation was enacted in Louisiana in 2014 in response to the suit which would effectively eliminate the claims, but in late 2014 the Louisiana state court judge declared the new law unconstitutional.  A motion to dismiss the claims was granted in Federal District Court and the plaintiff has appealed to the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Oral argument was heard on February 29, 2016.  The Court has not yet ruled. 
    
  In November 2013, we were served with two separate suits filed by Plaquemines Parish in the 25th Judicial District Court of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana (Designated Case Nos. 61-002 and 60-982).  Multiple defendants are named in each suit, and each suit involves a different area of operation within Plaquemines Parish.  Except as to the named defendants and areas of operation, the suits are identical.  Plaintiff alleges that defendants  oil and gas operations violated certain laws relating to the coastal zone management including failure to obtain permits, violation of permits, use of unlined waste pits, discharge of oil field wastes, including naturally occurring radioactive material, and that dredging operations exceeded unspecified permit limitations.  Plaintiff makes no specific allegations against any individual defendant and seeks unspecified monetary damages and declaratory relief, as well as restoration, costs of remediation and attorney fees.  The cases were removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana but were remanded back to the state court in 2015.  In November 2015, the Plaquemines Parish Council passed Resolution 15-389 requiring its attorneys to cease all work on the cases other than to dismiss all actions and lawsuits, but in April of 2016 the Parish voted to rescind such resolution.  The State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management has intervened in these cases and the Louisiana Attorney General has filed to supersede the Parish as Plaintiff.  Status conferences and potential court rulings are set for November 2016.

Our overall exposure to these suits is not currently determinable and we intend to vigorously defend these cases.  We are also a defendant in several other lawsuits that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any of these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

16. 
    Impairment of Property and Equipment 
       
  We impair our long-lived assets, including oil and gas properties and contract drilling equipment, when estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of an asset are less than its carrying value.  The amount of any such impairment is recognized based on the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset.  We categorize the measurement of fair value of these assets as Level 3 inputs.  We estimate the fair value of the impaired property by applying weighting factors to fair values determined under   three   different methods: (1) discounted cash flow method; (2) flowing daily production method; and (3) proved reserves per BOE method.  We then assign applicable weighting factors based on the relevant facts and circumstances.  We utilize all three methods when that information is available, or if not will utilize the discounted cash flow method.  We recorded a provision for impairment of proved properties of   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   $3.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  We recorded a provision for impairment of proved properties of   $3.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $5.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The provision for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was related to the write-down of certain non-core properties located in California and the Cotton Valley area of Texas to their estimated fair value and the provision for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was related to the write-down of certain non-core properties located in California, Oklahoma and the Cotton Valley area of Texas to their estimated fair value.  The provision for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was related to the write-down of certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and California and the provision for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was related to the write-down of certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin, California and Louisiana to their estimated fair value. 
    
  Unproved properties are nonproducing and do not have estimable cash flow streams.  Therefore, we estimate the fair value of individually significant prospects by obtaining, when available, information about recent market transactions in the vicinity of the prospects and adjust the market data as needed to give consideration to the proximity of the prospects to known fields and reservoirs, the extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospects, the remaining terms of leases holding the acreage in the prospects, recent drilling results in the vicinity of the prospects, and other risk-related factors such as drilling and completion costs, estimated product prices and other economic factors.  Individually insignificant prospects are grouped and impaired based on remaining lease terms and our historical experience with similar prospects.  Based on the assessments previously discussed, we will impair our unproved oil and gas properties when we determine that a prospect s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.  We categorize the measurement of fair value of unproved properties as Level 3 inputs.  We recorded provisions for impairment of unproved properties of   $2.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $2.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $2.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , and charged these impairments to abandonments and impairments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  The information in this Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  All statements, other than statements of historical or current facts, that address activities, events, outcomes and other matters that we plan, expect, intend, assume, believe, budget, predict, forecast, project, estimate or anticipate (and other similar expressions) will, should or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and beliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events and their effect on us.  While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate.  All statements concerning our expectations for future operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions.  Our forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in (1)   Item 1A - Risk Factors    and other cautionary statements in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , (2) our reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and (3) other announcements we make from time to time and in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places and include statements with respect to, among other things: 

estimates of our oil and gas reserves; 

estimates of our future oil and gas production, including estimates of any increases or decreases in production; 

planned capital expenditures and the availability of capital resources to fund those expenditures; 

our outlook on oil and gas prices; 

our outlook on domestic and worldwide economic conditions; 

our access to capital and our anticipated liquidity; 

our future business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, including any strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value; 

the impact of political and regulatory developments; 

our assessment of counterparty risks and the ability of our counterparties to perform their future obligations; 

estimates of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on earnings in future periods; and 

our future financial condition or results of operations and our future revenues and expenses. 
       
  We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties incident to the exploration for and development, production and marketing of oil and gas.  These risks include, but are not limited to: 

the possibility of unsuccessful exploration and development drilling activities; 

our ability to replace and sustain production; 

commodity price volatility, including continued low or furthering declining prices for oil and gas; 
     
   31 

     Table of Contents  

the potential need to sell assets or otherwise raise additional capital; 

the need to take impairments due to lower commodity prices; 

domestic and worldwide economic conditions; 

the availability of capital on economic terms to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions; 

our level of indebtedness (including the ability to service such indebtedness), liquidity and compliance with debt covenants; 

the impact of the past or future economic recessions on our business operations, financial condition and ability to raise capital; 

declines in the value of our oil and gas properties resulting in a decrease in our borrowing base under the revolving credit facility and impairments; 

the ability of financial counterparties to perform or fulfill their obligations under existing agreements; 

the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures; 

drilling and other operating risks; 

hurricanes and other weather conditions; 

lack of availability of goods and services; 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with drilling and production activities; 

the adverse effects of changes in applicable tax, environmental and other regulatory legislation; and 

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way.  The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of that data by geological engineers.  In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously.  If significant, these revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling.  Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. 
    
  As previously discussed, should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and in this Form 10-Q occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or any information contained in a forward-looking statement or any forward-looking statement in its entirety after the date made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
    
  All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

Overview 
    
  We have been committed to drilling primarily developmental oil wells in two primary oil-prone regions, the Permian Basin and the Giddings Area, where we have a significant inventory of developmental drilling opportunities.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we spent   $67.4 million   on exploration and development activities.  On October 24, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell substantially all of our assets in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas for a sale price of $400 million, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments. 

Key Factors to Consider 
    
  The following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for the   third quarter   of   2016   and the outlook for the remainder of   2016  .  

Oil, gas and NGL production per barrel of oil equivalent ( BOE ) decreased 10% in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  , with oil production decreasing 11% to   9,935   barrels per day, gas production decreasing 19% to   13,989   Mcf per day and NGL production increasing 9% to   1,685   barrels per day.  Oil and NGL production accounted for approximately   83%   of our total BOE production in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   82%   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  After giving effect to the sale of interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas in July 2016 and the sale of selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, oil, gas and NGL production per BOE decreased 7% in the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  . 

Interest expense for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   $26.6 million   versus   $13.6 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The increase was due primarily to $13.9 million of incremental interest expense on funded indebtedness under our second lien term loan credit facility issued in connection with our March 2016 refinancing transaction (the  Refinancing ).  We elected to pay interest on the term loan facility in-kind and resulted in an increase in the principal amount of the term loan to   $377.2 million  .  

We account for the warrants issued in connection with the Refinancing as derivative instruments and carry the warrants as a non-current liability at their fair value.  We recorded a   $123.4 million   loss on change in fair value in the   third quarter   of   2016   due primarily to the impact on the valuation model of a 211% increase in the market price of our common stock from $27.46 at June 30, 2016 to $85.44 at September 30, 2016. 

We recorded a   $1.3 million     gain   on commodity derivatives in the   third quarter   of   2016   (net of a   $2.4 million     loss   on settled contracts).  For the same period in   2015  , we recorded an   $18.1 million     gain   on commodity derivatives (including a   $6.4 million     gain   on settled contracts).  Since we do not presently designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards, we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark-to-market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations. 

Lower commodity prices negatively impacted our results of operations due to asset impairments.  We recorded an impairment of proved properties for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $1.1 million   related primarily to non-core prospects in California and the Cotton Valley area of Texas versus   $3.1 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015   related to non-core prospects in the Permian Basin and California. 

General and administrative ( G A ) expenses were   $5.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $4.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  Changes in compensation expense related to the Company s APO reward plans accounted for $0.9 million of the increase ($1.1 million credit in the   third quarter   of   2016   versus $2 million credit in the   third quarter   of   2015  ), and additional expense related to issuances of restricted stock and stock options under our recent long-term

incentive plan accounted for a $0.8 million increase.  These increases were partially offset by reductions in salary and personnel expense. 

Exploration and Development Activities 
    
  Overview 
    
  We spent   $67.4 million   during the first nine months of   2016   on exploration and development activities in the Permian Basin and the Giddings Area and currently plan to spend an additional $38.1 million during the remainder of   2016  .  On October 24, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell substantially all of our assets in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas for a sale price of $400 million, subject to customary and closing conditions and adjustments.  Our actual expenditures during   2016   may vary significantly from these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities may change during the year.  Factors such as changes in commodity prices, operating margins, the availability of capital resources, drilling results and other factors could increase or decrease our actual expenditures during   2016  . 
    
  Areas of Operations 
    
  Permian Basin 
    
  The Permian Basin is a sedimentary basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico known for its large oil and gas deposits from the Permian geologic period.  The Permian Basin covers an area approximately 250 miles wide and 350 miles long and contains commercial accumulations of oil and gas in multiple stratigraphic horizons at depths ranging from 1,000 feet to over 25,000 feet.  The Permian Basin is characterized by an extensive production history, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons and enhanced recovery potential.  Although many fields in the Permian Basin have been heavily exploited in the past, favorable product prices over the past several years, coupled with improved technology (including deep horizontal drilling) continued to attract high levels of drilling and recompletion activities.   
    
  We spent $38.5 million in the Permian Basin during the first nine months of   2016   on drilling and completion activities and $16.9 million on leasing and seismic activities. We drilled and completed 4 gross (4.0 net) operated wells in the Permian Basin and conducted various remedial operations on other wells during the first nine months of   2016  .  We currently plan to spend an additional $33.1 million on drilling and completion activities and $4 million on leasing activities in this area during the remainder of   2016  .  Following is a discussion of our principal assets in the Permian Basin. 
    
  Delaware Basin 
    
  We currently hold approximately 73,000 net acres in the active Wolfbone resource play in the Delaware Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas.  The Wolfbone resource play generally refers to the interval from the Bone Springs formation down through the Wolfcamp formation at depths typically found between 8,000 and 11,500 feet.  A Wolfbone well generally refers to a vertical well completed in multiple intervals within these formations or a horizontal well being completed in an interval within such formations.  These Permian aged formations in the Delaware Basin are composed of limestone, sandstone and shale.  Geology in the Delaware Basin consists of multiple stacked pay zones with both over-pressured and normal-pressured intervals.  
    
  We entered the Delaware Basin as a vertical play, but with encouraging results from our horizontal drilling, we shifted our emphasis to a horizontal program.  Most of our horizontal drilling to date has targeted the Wolfcamp A shale interval in Reeves County, Texas with 33 Wolfcamp A wells currently on production.  We also have four Wolfcamp C wells currently on production. 
    
  We spent approximately $34.7 million on drilling and completion activities and $16.8 million on leasing activities in the Wolfbone play during the first nine months of   2016  .  We plan to spend an additional $34 million on drilling, completion and leasing activities in this area during the remainder of   2016  .

     Table of Contents  

We own oil, natural gas and water disposal pipelines in Reeves County, Texas consisting of 118 miles of oil pipelines with current capacity of 10,000 barrels of oil per day (expandable to 25,000 barrels of oil per day), 117 miles of natural gas pipelines with a current capacity of 10,000 Mcf of natural gas per day (expandable to 25,000 Mcf of natural gas per day) and 118 miles of salt water disposal pipelines with a current capacity of 15,000 barrels of produced water per day (expandable to 36,000 barrels of produced water per day). 
    
  Other Permian Basin 
    
  Approximately 33% of our   2016   oil and gas production was derived from wells in parts of the Permian Basin other than our Delaware Basin Wolfbone resource play.  Many of these wells are located on the Central Basin Platform, geographically located between the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin, and produce from formations with conventional porosity such as the San Andres, Grayburg, Fusselman, Ellenburger and Yeso formations.  A significant portion of our production in this area is derived from mature fields, several of which are in varying stages of secondary and/or tertiary recovery.  
    
  Giddings Area 
    
  Most of our wells in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas were drilled as horizontal wells, many with multiple laterals in different producing horizons, including the Austin Chalk, Buda and Georgetown formations.  Hydrocarbons are also encountered in the Giddings Area from other formations, including the Cotton Valley, Deep Bossier, Eagle Ford Shale and Taylor formations.  We have approximately 170,000 net acres in the Giddings Area.  Following is a discussion of our principal assets in the Giddings Area. 
    
  Austin Chalk 
    
  Approximately 54% of our existing production in the Giddings Area is derived from the Austin Chalk formation, an upper Cretaceous geologic formation in the Gulf Coast region of the United States that stretches across numerous fields in Texas and Louisiana.  The Austin Chalk formation is generally encountered at depths of 5,500 to 7,000 feet.  Horizontal drilling is the primary technique used in the Austin Chalk formation to enhance productivity.  Most of our wells in this area were drilled as horizontal wells, many with multiple laterals in different producing horizons, including the Austin Chalk, Buda and Georgetown formations.   
    
  Eagle Ford Shale 
    
  Our horizontal Eagle Ford Shale play is concentrated in the northern portion of our legacy Austin Chalk acreage block in Robertson, Burleson and Lee Counties, Texas.  In this area, we currently have 41 horizontal Eagle Ford Shale wells on production.  During the first nine months of   2016  , we spent approximately $9.8 million on drilling, completion and leasing activities in the Eagle Ford Shale Area.  Given the sale announced on October 24, 2016 of substantially all of our assets in the Giddings area, we expect capital spending in this area will be negligible during the remainder of   2016  . 
    
  Other 
    
  We spent $2.2 million during the first nine months of   2016   on exploration and development activities in other regions, including Oklahoma and California and we currently do not plan to spend any additional capital during the remainder of   2016  .  
  Pipelines and Other Midstream Facilities 
    
  We own interests in and operate oil, natural gas and water service facilities in the state of Texas.  These midstream facilities consist of interests in approximately 423 miles of pipeline, two treating plants, one dehydration facility and multiple wellhead type treating and/or compression stations.  Most of our operated gas gathering and treating activities facilitate the transportation and marketing of our operated oil and gas production and third party producers. 
    
  Desta Drilling 
    
  Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Desta Drilling, L.P. ( Desta Drilling ), we currently have 8 drilling rigs available for our use or for contract drilling operations.  The Desta Drilling rigs are primarily reserved for our use, but are available to conduct contract drilling operations for third parties.  Due to the downturn in oil prices, all our rigs have been idle since November 2015.

Factors That Significantly Affect Our Financial Results 
    
  Revenue, cash flow from operations and future growth depend on many factors beyond our control, such as oil prices, cost of services and supplies, economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy.  Historical oil prices have been volatile and are expected to fluctuate widely in the future.  Sustained periods of low prices for oil could materially and adversely affect our financial position, our results of operations, the quantities of oil and gas that we can economically produce and our ability to obtain capital. 
    
  Like all businesses engaged in the exploration for and production of oil and gas, we face the challenge of natural production declines.  As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and gas production from a given well decreases.  Thus, an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces.  We attempt to overcome this natural decline by developing existing properties, implementing secondary and tertiary recovery techniques and by acquiring more reserves than we produce.  Our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production through exploration, development and acquisition.  We will maintain our focus on costs necessary to produce our reserves as well as the costs necessary to add reserves through production enhancement, drilling and acquisitions.  Our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from existing reserves and to acquire more reserves is dependent on availability of capital resources, and can be limited by many factors, including the ability to obtain capital in a cost-effective manner and to obtain permits and regulatory approvals in a timely manner.

Operating Results   Three-Month Periods 
    
  The following discussion compares our results for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   to the comparative period in   2015  .  Unless otherwise indicated, references to   2016   and   2015   within this section refer to the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Oil and gas operating results 
     
  Oil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $7.5 million, or 15%, in   2016   from   2015  .  Production variances accounted for a $5.7 million decrease and price variances accounted for a $1.8 million decrease.  Amortized deferred revenue in   2016   totaled   $0.4 million   as compared to   $0.8 million   in   2015  .  Oil, gas and NGL production in   2016   (on a BOE basis) decreased   10%   compared to   2015  .  Oil production decreased 11%, gas production decreased 19% and NGL production increased 9% in   2016   from   2015  .  After giving effect to the sale of interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas in July 2016 and the sale of selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, oil, gas and NGL production per BOE decreased 7% in   2016   as compared to   2015  .  Oil and NGL production accounted for approximately   83%   of our total BOE production in   2016   compared to   82%   in   2015  .  In   2016  , our realized oil price decreased 6% compared to   2015  , and our realized gas price increased 9%.  Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. 
    
   Production costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 14% to   $17.8 million   in   2016   as compared to   $20.7 million   in   2015   due to lower oilfield service costs.  After giving effect to a   10%   decrease in total production, production costs on a BOE basis, excluding production taxes, averaged   $12.25   per BOE in   2016   compared to   $12.68   per BOE in   2015  . 
    
  Oil and gas depletion expense increased $1.4 million from   2015   to   2016   due to a $4.9 million increase related to rate variances and a $3.5 million decrease due to production variances.  On a BOE basis, depletion expense increased 16% to   $27.09   per BOE in   2016   from   $23.26   per BOE in   2015  .  Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production.  We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs. 
    
  We recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of   $1.1 million   during   2016   as compared to   $3.1 million   in   2015  .  The   2016   impairment related to non-core prospects in California and the Cotton Valley area of Texas to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value.  The   2015   impairment related to non-core prospects in the Permian Basin and California.  Impairment of a proved property group is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the property group are less than its carrying value.  If prices decline from current levels, we may incur future impairments.  Although it is difficult to provide an estimate because of the numerous variables and management input decisions required to evaluate the amount of any asset impairments, they could be significant. 
    
  Exploration costs 
    
  We follow the successful efforts method of accounting; therefore, our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs, exploratory dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments are expensed.  In   2016  , we charged to expense $2.5 million of exploration costs, as compared to $1.1 million in   2015  .  The expense for   2016   includes a charge of $1.8 million related to unproved acreage impairments in Smith County, Texas.  Exploration costs in   2015   were due primarily to dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments in California, Oklahoma and South Louisiana. 
    
  Contract Drilling Services 
    
  Drilling services revenues received by our subsidiary, Desta Drilling, along with the related drilling services costs pertaining to the net interest owned by CWEI, have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  Drilling rig services revenue related to external customers was negligible in   2016   and   2015   due to decreased demand for contract drilling services.  Drilling services costs, net of eliminations, were   $1.1 million   in   2016   compared to   $0.9 million   in   2015  .  Contract drilling depreciation for   2016   and   2015   was   $2.9 million  .  Due to the downturn in oil prices, all our rigs have been idle since November 2015.

General and Administrative 
    
  G A expenses increased $1 million from   $4.6 million   in   2015   to   $5.6 million   in   2016  .  Changes in compensation expense related to our APO reward plans accounted for $0.9 million of the increase ($1.1 million credit in   2016   versus $2 million credit in   2015  ),     and additional expense related to issuances of restricted stock and stock options under our recent long-term incentive plan accounted for a $0.8 million increase.  These increases were partially offset by reductions in salary and personnel expense. 
    
  Interest expense 
    
  Interest expense increased from   $13.6 million   in   2015   to   $26.6 million   in   2016   due primarily to $13.9 million of incremental interest expense on funded indebtedness incurred under a second lien term loan credit facility issued in connection with the Refinancing.  We elected to pay interest on the term loan facility in-kind and resulted in an increase in the principal amount of the term loan to   $377.2 million  . 
    
  Gain on early extinguishment of long-term debt 
    
  We redeemed   $100 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes in a tender offer in August 2016 and recorded a   $4 million   gain on early extinguishment of long-term debt consisting of a   $5 million   discount and a   $1 million   write-off of debt issuance costs. 
    
  Loss on change in fair value of common stock warrants 
    
  We account for the warrants issued in connection with the Refinancing as derivative instruments and carry the warrants as a non-current liability at their fair value.  We recorded a   $123.4 million   loss on change in fair value in   2016   due primarily to the impact on the valuation model of a 211% increase in the market price of our common stock from $27.46 at June 30, 2016 to $85.44 at September 30, 2016. 
    
  Gain/loss on commodity derivatives 
    
  We did not designate any commodity derivative contracts in   2016   or   2015   as cash flow hedges; therefore, all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark-to-market valuations have been recorded as gain/loss on commodity derivatives.  In   2016  , we reported a   $1.3 million     gain   on commodity derivatives (net of a   $2.4 million     loss   on settled contracts) compared to an   $18.1 million     gain   on commodity derivatives (including a   $6.4 million     gain   on settled contracts) in   2015  .  Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on commodity derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.  
    
  Impairment of investments and other 
    
  We recorded a $0.5 million charge to partially impair the carrying value of our investment in Dalea Investment Group, LLC ( Dalea ) in   2015  . 
    
  Gain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory 
    
  We recorded a net   gain   of   $9.9 million   on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in   2016   compared to a net   loss   of   $3.4 million   in   2015  .  The   2016     gain   related primarily to the sale of our interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas in July 2016.  The   2015     loss   related primarily to a $4.8 million write-down of inventory to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value partially offset by a gain of $1.8 million related primarily to the sale of selected leases in South Louisiana in September 2015.  Gain on sales of assets are included in other operating revenues and loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  Income taxes  
    
  Our estimated federal and state effective income tax rate in   2016   of   4.8%   was less than the statutory federal rate of 35% due primarily to permanent differences related to revaluation of the warrants issued in connection with the Refinancing, increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions.

Operating Results   Nine-Month Periods 
    
  The following discussion compares our results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to the comparative period in   2015  .  Unless otherwise indicated, references to   2016   and   2015   within this section refer to the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Oil and gas operating results 
    
  Oil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $62 million, or 36%, in   2016   from   2015  .  Production variances accounted for a $31.5 million decrease and price variances accounted for a $30.5 million decrease.  Oil and gas sales in   2016   also includes   $1.1 million   of amortized deferred revenue compared to   $4.3 million   in   2015   attributable to the VPP.   Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP.  Oil, gas and NGL production in   2016   (on a BOE basis) decreased   16%   compared to   2015  .  Oil production decreased 19%, gas production decreased 16%, and NGL production increased 2% in   2016   from   2015  .  After giving effect to the sale of interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas in July 2016 and the sale of selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, oil, gas and NGL production in   2016   (on a BOE basis) decreased 13% compared to   2015  .  Oil and NGL production accounted for approximately   83%   of our total BOE production in   2016   compared to   84%   in   2015  .  In   2016  , our realized oil price decreased 22% compared to   2015  , and our realized gas price decreased 17%.  Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. 
    
  Production costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 19% to   $54.2 million   in   2016   as compared to   $67.2 million   in   2015  , due primarily to lower oilfield service costs and reductions in production taxes associated with a decrease in oil and gas sales.  After giving effect to a   16%   decrease in total production, production costs, excluding production taxes, averaged   $13.00   per BOE in   2016   compared to   $12.99   per BOE in   2015  . 
    
  Oil and gas depletion expense decreased $6.6 million from   2015   to   2016   due to an $18 million decrease related to production variances and an $11.4 million increase due to rate variances.  On a BOE basis, depletion expense increased 12% to   $27.64   per BOE in   2016   from   $24.60   per BOE in   2015  .  Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production.  We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs. 
    
  We recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of   $3.4 million   during   2016   as compared to   $5.6 million   in   2015  .  The   2016   impairment related to non-core prospects in California, Oklahoma and the Cotton Valley area of Texas to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value.  The   2015   impairment related to non-core prospects in the Permian Basin, California and Louisiana.  Impairment of a proved property group is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the property group are less than its carrying value.  If prices decline from current levels, we may incur future impairments.

In   2016  , we reported a   $14 million     loss   on commodity derivatives (including a   $2.4 million     loss   on settled contacts) compared to a   $10.4 million     gain   on commodity derivatives (including a   $4.6 million     gain   on settled contracts) in   2015  .  Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on commodity derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.  
    
  Impairment of investments and other 
    
  We recorded an $8.4 million charge to fully impair the carrying value of our investment in Dalea in   2016  , as compared to a partial impairment of $1.4 million in   2015  . 
    
  Gain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory 
    
  We recorded a net   gain   of   $7.9 million   on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in   2016   compared to a net   gain   of   $0.8 million   in   2015  .  The   2016     gain   related primarily to the sale of our interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas in July 2016. The 2015 gain related primarily to the sale of selected leases in South Louisiana in September 2015, the release of sales proceeds previously held in escrow pending resolution of title requirements associated with the sale of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014, the sale of leases in Oklahoma in May and June 2015, and the sale of selected wells in Martin and Yoakum Counties, Texas in March 2015.  The 2015 gain was partially offset by a $7.4 million write-down of inventory to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Overview 
    
  Our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves.  We pledge substantially all of our producing oil and gas properties to secure our obligations under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility (see       Revolving credit facility    and       Term loan credit facility   ).  The banks under the revolving credit facility establish a borrowing base, in part, by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties.  We believe the term loans have provided us with a source of dedicated liquidity; however, we intend to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility as needed in the future to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program.  Our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves.  If product prices decrease, our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks under the revolving credit facility may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base, thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program.  However, we may mitigate the effects of product prices on our cash flow and borrowing base through the use of commodity derivatives. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $98.1 million   available on the revolving credit facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling   $1.9 million  , as compared to $348.1 million of availability on the facility at   September 30, 2015  .  Our indebtedness at   September 30, 2016   was   $846.5 million  , consisting of   $351.5 million   including paid in-kind interest, net of original issue discount and debt issuance costs, under the second lien term loan credit facility and   $495 million   in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of original issue discount and debt issuance costs.  
    
  Recent Events and Outlook for 2016 
    
  On October 24, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell substantially all of our assets in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas for a sale price of $400 million, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments.  We expect to close the sale in December 2016 and use the proceeds from the sale to fund development in the Delaware Basin and repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness.  We do not expect the sale of the Giddings assets to have a significant reduction in funds available under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  In July 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell   5,051,100   shares of common stock to funds managed by Ares for cash proceeds of   $150 million   or approximately   $29.70   per share (the  Private Placement ), which transaction closed on   August 29, 2016  .  In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into an amendment to the term loan facility, waiving certain restrictions to enable us to use proceeds from equity issuances and specified asset sales for debt reduction and capital expenditures. 
    
  In July 2016, we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to $100 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes with a bid range from $880 to $950 per each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes.  The tender offer expired on August 29, 2016 and we accepted for purchase   $100 million   in aggregate principal amount of 2019 Senior Notes at a purchase price of   $947.50   per   $1,000   principal amount, which included an early tender premium of   $30.00   for each   $1,000   principal amount of 2019 Senior Notes so purchased.

  The following table summarizes, by area, our actual expenditures for exploration and development activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and our planned expenditures for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 

Our expenditures for exploration and development activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $67.4 million  .  We financed these expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   with cash flow from operating activities, a combination of proceeds from the Refinancing and the Private Placement, proceeds from asset sales, and borrowings under our credit facilities.  We currently plan to spend approximately   $105.5 million   on exploration and development activities during fiscal   2016  .  We plan to continue utilizing one rig in Reeves County, Texas for the remainder of 2016.  With recent improvements in drill times we now expect to have drilled eight wells by the end of the year, with five wells on production and three wells in various stages of completion.  Our actual expenditures during   2016   may vary significantly from these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities may change during the year.  Factors, such as changes in commodity prices, operating margins, the availability of capital resources, drilling results and other factors, could increase or decrease our actual expenditures during the remainder of fiscal   2016  . 
    
  Based on preliminary estimates, our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that our anticipated operating cash flows, combined with cash on hand and funds available to us under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our planned exploration and development activities at these reduced levels through 2016.  Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable, these forecasts are inherently uncertain and the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility may be less than expected, cash flows may be less than expected, or capital expenditures may be more than expected.  We will consider options for obtaining alternative capital resources, including selling assets or accessing capital markets if necessary when we deem appropriate.  Further significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves. 
    
     Cash flow provided by operating activities 
    
  Substantially all of our cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves.  We use this cash flow to fund our on-going exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves.  Variations in cash flows from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures. 
    
  Cash flow provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $47 million  , or   86%  , as compared to the corresponding period in   2015   due primarily to lower commodity prices and decreased production. 
    
  Revolving credit facility 
    
  We may borrow money under a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of   16   banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  On March 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility in connection with the Refinancing (see      Term loan credit facility   ).  The amendment, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments of the lenders from   $450 million   to   $100 million  .  The aggregate commitments may be increased to   $150 million   if we meet a minimum ratio of the discounted present value of our proved developed producing reserves to our debt under the revolving credit facility of   1.2   to   1.0  .  Increases in aggregate lender commitments require the consent of each lender.

     Table of Contents  

The amendment also increased the applicable interest rates under our revolving credit facility by   0.75%   at every borrowing base utilization level.  At our election, interest under the revolving credit facility is determined by reference to (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin between   2.5%   and   3.5%   per year or (2) the greatest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus   0.5%   or (C) one-month LIBOR plus   1%   plus, in any of (A), (B) or (C), an applicable margin between   1.5%   and   2.5%   per year.  We are also required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the revolving credit facility of   0.5%   per year.  The applicable margin is determined based on the utilization of the borrowing base.  Interest and fees are payable quarterly, except that interest on LIBOR-based tranches is due at maturity of each tranche but no less frequently than quarterly. 
    
  The revolving credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens.  One such covenant requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of at least   1   to   1  .  The March 2016 amendment replaced a requirement that we maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a less restrictive ratio of debt outstanding solely under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX to be less than   2.0   to   1.0  . 
    
  The revolving credit facility matures in April 2019 and is subject to an accelerated maturity date of October 1, 2018 unless our existing 2019 Senior Notes are refinanced or extended in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility prior to October 1, 2018. 
    
  The borrowing base, which is based on the discounted present value of future net cash flows from oil and gas production, is redetermined by the banks semiannually in May and November.  We or the banks may also request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year.  If, at any time, the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility, we will be required to (1) provide additional security, (2) prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficiency, (3) prepay the deficiency in not more than   five   equal monthly installments plus accrued interest, or (4) take any combination of options (1) through (3). 
    
  The revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least   90%   of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the revolving credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests evaluated in determining the borrowing base.  The obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI s material restricted domestic subsidiaries. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $98.1 million   available under the revolving credit facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling   $1.9 million  .  The effective annual interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, excluding bank fees and amortization of debt issue costs, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   2.5%  .  We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016.  Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders. 
    
  The failure to comply with the foregoing covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the revolving credit facility.  Other events of default under the revolving credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority.  The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding. 
    
  Working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).  Since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the revolving credit facility, we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of commodity derivatives.  Our GAAP reported working capital increased to   $189.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   from working capital of   $3.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  After giving effect to the adjustments, our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was   $297.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $301.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

The following table reconciles our GAAP working capital to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

As a condition to borrowing funds or issuing letters of credit under our revolving credit facility, we must remain in compliance with the financial and non-financial covenants, including financial ratios, in our revolving credit facility, as amended to date.  We also must make certain representations and warranties to our bank lenders at the time of each borrowing.  We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  However, if we increase leverage and our liquidity is reduced, we may fail to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future.  If we fail to meet any of these loan covenants, we would ask the banks to waive compliance, amend the revolving credit facility to allow us to become compliant or grant us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means.  Although we believe our bank lenders are well secured under the terms of our revolving credit facility, there is no assurance that the bank lenders will waive or amend our covenants or other conditions to further lending.  If a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks, the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets. 
    
  The lending group under the credit facility includes the following institutions:  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Compass Bank, Frost Bank, Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, KeyBank National Association, Natixis, New York Branch, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, Fifth Third Bank, U.S. Bank National Association, Whitney Bank, Bank of America, N.A., Branch Banking and Trust Company, Capital One, National Association and PNC Bank, National Association. 
    
   From time to time, we engage in other transactions with lenders under the revolving credit facility.  Such lenders or their affiliates may serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,     JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Shell Trading Risk Management LLC and Fifth Third Bank were the counterparties to our commodity derivative agreements.  Our obligations under commodity derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  Term loan credit facility 
    
  On   March 8, 2016  , we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks.  Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of   $16.8 million  , for cash proceeds of $333.2 million.  Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase   2,251,364   shares of our common stock at a price of   $22.00   per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans.  The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 18.5% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 15.6% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis.  In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to the initial warrant holders 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of the Board.  Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the then-outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees. 
    
  Interest on the term loans is payable quarterly in cash at   12.5%   per year; however, during the period from March 15, 2016 through March 31, 2018, we may elect to pay interest for any quarter in-kind at   15%   per year.  We paid interest for the period commencing from   March 15, 2016   and ending   March 31, 2016   in cash and elected to pay interest for the quarters ended   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2016   in-kind.  In August 2016, we elected to pay interest for the quarterly period ending December 31, 2016 in cash.  Future quarterly elections to pay in-kind must be made at least 30 days prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter.  
    
  The term loan credit facility matures on   March 15, 2021  , but is subject to an earlier maturity on   December 31, 2018  , if we do not extend or refinance our existing 2019 Senior Notes on or prior to that date.

The term loan credit facility is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least   90%   of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the term loan credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests.  The obligations under the term loan credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI s material restricted domestic subsidiaries.  Optional and mandatory prepayments made prior to   September 15, 2020   are subject to make-whole or prepayment premiums. 
    
  The term loan credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens.  One such covenant requires that we maintain an asset-to-secured debt coverage ratio as of each   December 31   and   June 30   of each year, beginning with   December 31, 2018  , of at least   1.2   to   1.0  .  We were in compliance with these covenants at   September 30, 2016  .  Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016.  Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders.  In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into an amendment to the term loan facility, waiving certain restrictions to enable us to use proceeds from equity issuances and specified asset sales for debt reduction and capital expenditures.  The amendment is effective upon closing of the Private Placement. 
    
  The failure to comply with these covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the term loan credit facility.  Other events of default under the term loan credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority.  The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding. 
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  In March 2011, we issued   $300 million   of aggregate principal amount of 2019 Senior Notes.  The 2019 Senior Notes, which are unsecured, were issued at par and bear interest at   7.75%   per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year.  In April 2011, we issued an additional   $50 million   aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes with an original issue discount of   1%   or   $0.5 million  .  In October 2013, we issued an additional   $250 million   of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes at par to yield   7.75%   to maturity.  All of the 2019 Senior Notes are treated as a single class of debt securities under the same indenture (the  Indenture ).  In August 2016, we redeemed   $100 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes in a tender offer and for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   recorded a   $4 million     gain   on early extinguishment of long-term debt, consisting of a   $5 million   premium and a   $1 million   write-off of debt issuance costs.  We may redeem some or all of the remaining 2019 Senior Notes at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) equal to   100%   beginning on April 1, 2017 or for any period thereafter, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  The Indenture contains covenants that restrict our ability to:  (1) borrow money; (2) issue redeemable or preferred stock; (3) pay distributions or dividends; (4) make investments; (5) create liens without securing the 2019 Senior Notes; (6) enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; (7) sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies; (8) enter into transactions with affiliates; (9) guarantee indebtedness; and (10) enter into new lines of business.  One such covenant generally restricts our ability to incur indebtedness if our ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense (as these terms are defined in the Indenture) is less than   2.25   times.  However, this restriction does not prevent us from incurring indebtedness under a credit facility (as defined in the Indenture) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (a)   $500 million   and (b)   30%   of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Indenture).  These covenants are subject to a number of additional important exceptions and qualifications as described in the Indenture.  We were in compliance with these covenants at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Asset Sales 
    
  From time to time, we sell certain of our proved and unproved properties when we believe it is more advantageous to dispose of the selected properties than to continue to hold them.  During the first nine months of   2016  , we received cash proceeds aggregating   $27.4 million   from various sales of assets.  On October 24, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell substantially all of our assets in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas for a sale price of $400 million, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments.  We expect to close the sale in December 2016.  We are considering other selected sales as a source of additional funds to supplement cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility to meet our capital needs.

     Table of Contents  

Alternative capital resources 
    
  We believe we currently have adequate liquidity to enable us to fund our expected capital expenditures for   2016   through a combination of cash on hand and cash flow from operations. 
    
  Subject to any restrictions in the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility, we may also use other capital resources, including (1) entering into joint venture participation agreements with other industry or financial partners in our core development areas, (2) monetizing all or a portion of our core or non-core assets, and (3) issuing additional debt or equity securities in private or public offerings, in order to finance a portion of our capital spending in fiscal   2016   and subsequent periods.  While we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternative capital resources, if needed, there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us. 
    
  Off-balance sheet arrangements  
    
  Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3 -  
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  Our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates.  The following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks, describe our strategy for managing such risks, and to quantify the potential effect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with Part II,    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Oil and Gas Prices 
    
  Our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market commodity prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas.  These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.  These factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products, foreign supply of oil and gas, the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions, both foreign and domestic.  We cannot predict future oil and gas commodity prices with any degree of certainty.  Sustained weakness in oil and gas commodity prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically.  Any reduction in reserves, including reductions due to commodity price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities.  Similarly, any improvements in oil and gas commodity prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.  Based on December 31, 2015 reserve estimates, we project that a $1 decline in the price per barrel of oil and a $0.50 decline in the price per Mcf of gas from year end 2015 would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending December 31, 2016 by $6.6 million. 
    
  From time to time, we utilize commodity derivatives, consisting primarily of swaps, floors and collars to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production.  We do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes.  When using swaps to hedge our oil and natural gas production, we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract (generally NYMEX futures prices), resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.  When purchasing floors, we receive a fixed price (put strike price) if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity.  If the market price is greater than the put strike price, no payments are due from either party.  Costless collars are a combination of puts and calls, and contain a fixed floor price (put strike price) and ceiling price (call strike price).  If the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price.  If the market price is between the call and the put strike prices, no payments are due from either party.  The commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products.  In addition to commodity derivatives, we may, from time to time, sell a portion of our gas production under short-term contracts at fixed prices. 
    
  The decision to initiate or terminate commodity hedges is made by management based on its expectation of future market price movements.  We have no set goals for the percentage of our production we hedge and we do not use any formulas or triggers in deciding when to initiate or terminate a hedge.  If we enter into swaps or collars and the floating market price at the settlement date is higher than the fixed price or the fixed ceiling price, we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received.  If we  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

terminate a swap, collar or floor because we anticipate future increases in market prices, we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise. 
    
  The following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .  The settlement prices of commodity derivatives are based on NYMEX futures prices. 
    
  Swaps: 

Costless Collars: 

We use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil may have on the fair value of our commodity derivatives.  As of   September 30, 2016  , a $1 per barrel change in the price of oil would change the fair value of our commodity derivatives by approximately   $2.1 million  . 
    
  Interest Rates 
    
  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our long-term debt with a variable interest rate.  At   September 30, 2016  , the 2019 Senior Notes had a fixed rate of 7.75%, a carrying value of   $495 million   and an approximate fair value of   $481.3 million  , based on current market quotes.  We estimate that a hypothetical change in the fair value of our long-term debt resulting from a 100-basis point change in interest rates would be approximately   $10.6 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , our Second Lien Term Loan had a fixed rate of 12.5%, if paid in cash, and a fixed rate of 15%, if paid in-kind, a carrying value of   $351.5 million   and an approximate fair value of   $275.3 million  .

    Controls and Procedures 
       
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  In September 2002, the Board adopted a policy designed to establish disclosure controls and procedures that are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that our management will be able to collect, process and disclose both financial and non-financial information, on a timely basis, in our reports to the SEC and other communications with our stockholders.  Our disclosure controls and procedures include all processes necessary to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive and chief financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
    
  With respect to our disclosure controls and procedures: 

management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report; 

this evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive and chief financial officers; and  

it is the conclusion of our chief executive and chief financial officers that as of   September 30, 2016   these disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information that is required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms established by the SEC, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive and chief financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
       
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  No changes in internal control over financial reporting were made during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1 -  
    Legal Proceedings 
       
  In February 2012, BMT O G TX, L.P. filed a suit in the 143rd Judicial District in Reeves County, Texas to terminate a lease under our farm-in agreement with Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C. ( Chesapeake ).  Plaintiffs are the lessors and claim a breach of the lease which they allege gives rise to termination of the lease.  CWEI denies a breach and argues in the alternative that (i) any breach was cured in accordance with the lease and (ii) a breach will not give rise to lease termination.  In October 2013, a judge ruled that CWEI and Chesapeake are jointly and severally liable for damages to plaintiffs in the amount of approximately $2.9 million and attorney fees of $0.8 million.  A loss of $1.4 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 in connection with the judgment.  CWEI appealed the judgment and on July 8, 2015, the El Paso Court of Appeals reversed the trial court judgment in its entirety and rendered judgment that Plaintiffs take nothing on all claims against CWEI and Chesapeake.  Plaintiffs appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Texas Supreme Court, and on October 21, 2016, the Texas Supreme Court denied Plaintiffs  Petition for Review. 
    
  CWEI has been named a defendant in three lawsuits filed in Louisiana, one by Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East ( SELFPA ) and two by Plaquemines Parish, each alleging that historical industry operations have significantly damaged coastal marshlands. 
    
  In July 2013, the SELFPA case was filed in Orleans Parish and alleged that dredging and other oilfield operations of the 95 oil and gas company defendants caused degradation and destruction of the coastal marshlands which serve as a buffer protecting the coastal area of Louisiana from storms.  The case was removed to Federal District Court.  Legislation was enacted in Louisiana in 2014 in response to the suit which would effectively eliminate the claims, but in late 2014 the Louisiana state court judge declared the new law unconstitutional.  A motion to dismiss the claims was granted in Federal District Court and the plaintiff has appealed to the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Oral argument was heard on February 29, 2016.  The Court has not yet ruled. 
    
  In November 2013, we were served with two separate suits filed by Plaquemines Parish in the 25th Judicial District Court of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana (Designated Case Nos. 61-002 and 60-982).  Multiple defendants are named in each suit, and each suit involves a different area of operation within Plaquemines Parish.  Except as to the named defendants and areas of operation, the suits are identical.  Plaintiff alleges that defendants  oil and gas operations violated certain laws relating to the coastal zone management including failure to obtain permits, violation of permits, use of unlined waste pits, discharge of oil field wastes, including naturally occurring radioactive material, and that dredging operations exceeded unspecified permit limitations.  Plaintiff makes no specific allegations against any individual defendant and seeks unspecified monetary damages and declaratory relief, as well as restoration, costs of remediation and attorney fees.  The cases were removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana but were remanded back to the state court in 2015.  In November 2015, the Plaquemines Parish Council passed Resolution 15-389 requiring its attorneys to cease all work on the cases other than to dismiss all actions and lawsuits, but in April of 2016 the Parish voted to rescind such resolution.  The State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management has intervened in these cases and the Louisiana Attorney General has filed to supersede the Parish as Plaintiff.  Status conferences and potential court rulings are set for November 2016. 
    
  Our overall exposure to these suits is not currently determinable and we intend to vigorously defend these cases.  We are also a defendant in several other lawsuits that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any of these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A -  
    Risk Factors 
       
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in   Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors    in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial individually or in the aggregate may also impair our business operations.  If any of these risks actually occur, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development projects as scheduled.  In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline.

  WHEREAS, the Company and Employee previously entered into this Agreement (as it was in effect immediately prior to the Restatement Effective Date) effective as of June 1, 2015 (the    Effective Date    
  WHEREAS, the Company and Employee have determined that it is in their respective best interests to amend and restate the Agreement; and 
  WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to employ Employee, and Employee desires to continue to be employed by the Company and to commit himself to serve the Company on the terms herein provided.   
  NOW, THERFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree, effective as of the Restatement Effective Date (unless otherwise provided herein), as follows: 
  1.  Employment  .   The Company shall employ Employee, and Employee accepts employment with the Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary of such date (the    Initial Term      provided  ,   however  , that (a) on such third anniversary date (and on the fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the Effective Date thereafter), the term of this Agreement will automatically (without any action by either party) be extended for one additional year (each, a    Renewal Period   ), unless, at least 90 days prior to either the third, fourth, or fifth anniversary date of the Effective Date, as applicable, the Company or Employee has given written notice to the other party (a    Non-Renewal Notice   ) that the Company or Employee does not wish to extend the term of the Agreement (a    Non-Renewal   ), and (b) the Initial Term or any Renewal Period, as applicable, may be terminated prior to the expiration thereof in accordance with   Section   4.  Either party may elect not to renew this Agreement;   provided  , that, if no Non-Renewal Notice is given, and if this Agreement is not terminated earlier in accordance with   Section   4, the Agreement will expire by its terms on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.  The term    Employment Term    means the period from the Effective Date until the expiration of the Initial Term and any applicable Renewal Period pursuant to this   Section   1 or in accordance with   Section   4 of this Agreement. 
  2.  Position and Duties  . 
  (a)  During the Employment Term, Employee shall hold the title of President.  The Company and Employee agree that the Employee shall have duties and responsibilities consistent with the position set forth above in a company the size and of the nature of the Company, and such other duties and authority that are assigned to Employee from time to time by the Company s Board of Directors (the    Board   ), or such other officer of the Company as shall be designated by the Board.  Employee shall report to the Board, or to such other officer of the Company as shall be designated by the Board  
  (b)  Employee agrees to devote his best efforts and his full business time and attention to the business and affairs of the Company.  Employee shall perform his duties and responsibilities to the best of his abilities in a diligent and professional manner, and agrees to comply with all of the policies of the Company, including such policies with respect to legal compliance, conflicts of interest, confidentiality and business ethics as are from time to time in effect.  During the Employment Term, Employee shall not engage in any business activity which, in the reasonable judgment of the Board, conflicts or interferes with the duties and responsibilities of Employee hereunder, whether or not such activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage, without the prior written approval of the Company or engage in or be employed by any other business;   provided  ,   however  , that the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2   shall not limit or prohibit Employee from engaging in community, charitable and social activities, personal investment activities and the endeavors set forth on   Exhibit A   attached hereto, in each case not interfering with the Employee s performance and obligations hereunder.  For the avoidance of doubt, this   Section 2   shall not limit or prohibit Employee from providing services to or for the benefit of the Williams Entities pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Service Agreement dated as of March 1, 2005 by and among the Company and the Williams Entities (as defined therein), as amended from time to time. 
  (c)  Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee owes a duty of loyalty, fidelity and allegiance to act at all times in the best interests of the Company and to do no intentional act that would injure the business, interests, or reputation of the Company or any of its Affiliates.  In keeping with these duties, Employee shall make full disclosure to the Company of all significant business opportunities pertaining to the Company s business and shall not appropriate for Employee s own benefit

  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

business opportunities concerning the subject matter of the fiduciary relationship.  Except as set forth in   Section 5(d)(ii)  , for purposes of this Agreement, the term    Affiliate    shall mean an individual or entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by or is under common control with a specified individual or entity. 
  3.  Compensation  . 
  (a)  Base Salary  .  During the Employment Term, Employee s base salary shall be $584,600 per annum, which salary may be increased (but not decreased) by the Board (or a designated committee thereof) in its discretion (the    Base Salary   ), which Base Salary shall be payable in regular installments in accordance with the Company s general payroll practices and subject to withholding and other payroll taxes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee consents to the 20% reduction in Base Salary that became effective as of February 16, 2015 and agrees that such reduction in Base Salary is not and will not be considered a breach of this Agreement or any prior agreement and shall not constitute  Good Reason  for purposes of Section 4(d) of this Agreement or any prior agreement, even though such reduction continues in effect on and after the Effective Date. 
  (b)  Annual Bonus  .  Employee shall be eligible to receive one or more bonuses each year during the Employment Term to be determined by the Board (or a designated committee thereof), in its sole discretion based on performance or other criteria to be adopted by the Board (or a designated committee thereof).  Any bonus amount earned with respect to a calendar year shall be paid in a cash lump sum no later than March 15 of the following calendar year. 
  (c)  Employee Benefits  .  Employee will be entitled during the Employment Term to receive such welfare benefits and other fringe benefits (including vacation, medical, dental, life insurance, 401(k) and other employee benefits and perquisites, such as club membership dues) as the Company may offer from time to time to similarly situated executive level employees, subject to applicable eligibility requirements.  The Company shall not, however, by reason of this   Section 3(c)  , be obligated to institute, maintain, or refrain from changing, amending, or discontinuing any such benefit plan or program, so long as any such changes are similarly applicable to similarly situated employees of the Company. 
  (d)  Business Expenses  .  The Company shall reimburse Employee for all reasonable expenses incurred by him in the course of performing his duties under this Agreement to the extent consistent with the Company s written policies in effect from time to time with respect to travel, entertainment and other business expenses, subject to the Company s requirements with respect to reporting and documentation of such expenses.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the amount of expenses for which Employee is eligible to receive reimbursement during any calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses for which Employee is eligible to receive reimbursement during any other calendar year within the Employment Term.  Reimbursement of expenses under this   Section 3(d)   shall be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.  Employee is not permitted to receive a payment or other benefit in lieu of reimbursement under this   Section 3(d)  . 
  (e)  Long Term Incentive Compensation  .  Prior to the Effective Date Employee may have, as determined by the Board (or a designated committee thereof) in its sole discretion, previously received grants of, or payments under, non-equity related awards pursuant to the APO Incentive Plan, the APO Reward Plans, the SWR Reward Plan, the APO Working Interest Trusts, the APO Working Interest Grant (collectively, the    APO Plans   ), subject to the terms and conditions thereof.  Any grants previously awarded to Executive pursuant to the Company s APO Plans that are outstanding on the Effective Date hereof shall, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the APO Plans.  On and after the Effective Date employee may, as determined by the Board (or a designated committee thereof) in its sole discretion, receive grants of, or payments under, equity or non-equity related awards pursuant to the Company s Long Term Incentive Plan (the    LTIP   ) or any successor plan thereto. 
  (f)  Automobile Allowance  .  During the Employment Term, Employee will be entitled to receive a car allowance in accordance with the Company s automobile allowance policy in effect from time to time.   
  4.  Termination of Employment  .    Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company and Employee, Employee s employment hereunder may be terminated under the following circumstances: 
  (a)  Death  .  Employee s employment hereunder shall terminate upon his death. 
  (b)  Disability  .  Employee s employment hereunder shall terminate upon a determination that he has incurred a Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,    Disability    means, at any time the Company sponsors a long-term disability plan for the Company s employees,  disability  as defined in such long-term disability plan for the purpose of determining a participant s eligibility for benefits,   provided  , that if the long-term disability plan contains multiple definitions of disability,  Disability  shall refer to that definition of disability which, if Employee qualified for such disability benefits, would provide coverage for the longest period of time.  The determination of whether Employee has a Disability shall be made in good faith by the person or persons required to make disability determinations under the long-term disability plan.  If Employee is not covered under the  
  
   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

Company s long-term disability plan or if the Company does not sponsor a long-term disability plan at such time, then the term  Disability  hereunder shall mean a  permanent and total disability  as defined in section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), and, in this case, the existence of any such Disability shall be certified by a physician acceptable to both the Company and Employee.  In the event the parties are not able to agree on the choice of a physician, each party shall select a physician who, in turn, shall select a third physician to render such certification. 
  (c)  Termination by the Company  .  The Company may terminate Employee s employment with or without Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Cause    means Employee (i) has been convicted of a misdemeanor that involves intentionally dishonest behavior or that the Company determines in good faith will have a material adverse effect on the reputation of the Company or any felony, (ii) has engaged in conduct which is materially injurious (monetarily or otherwise) to the Company or any of its Affiliates (including misuse of the Company s or an Affiliate s funds or other property), (iii) has engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his duties for the Company, (iv) has willfully refused without proper legal reason to perform his duties for the Company, (v) has intentionally breached any material provision of this Agreement or any other material agreement between the Company and Employee, or (vi) has intentionally breached any material corporate policy maintained and established by the Company that is of general applicability to executives of the Company;   provided  ,   however  , as to clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) contained in this   Section 4(c)  , if such acts or omissions could be cured by Employee (as reasonably determined by the Board), the Company must give Employee written notice of the acts or omissions constituting Cause within 30 days of the occurrence of such acts or omissions and, in such case, no termination shall be for Cause unless and until Employee fails to cure such acts or omissions within 30 days following receipt of such written notice. 
  (d)  Termination by Employee  .  Employee may, upon giving the Company no less than 30 days advance written notice, terminate Employee s employment without Good Reason or for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Good Reason    shall mean, without the express written consent of Employee, the occurrence of one of the following: (i) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement, (ii) a material     reduction in Employee s Base Salary, including any series of salary reductions (whether or not related) that are not agreed to by Employee in writing and that, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material reduction when compared to Employee s Base Salary in effect on the Effective Date or as adjusted after the Effective Date in accordance with   Section 3(a)   hereof or with Employee s prior written consent, (iii) a material diminution in Employee s authority, duties or responsibilities or the assignment of duties to Employee that are not materially commensurate with Employee s position with the Company, or (iv) a change in the geographic location at which Employee must normally perform services to a location outside of Midland     County, Texas.  For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction in Employee s Base Salary, regardless of amount, could be material if, in light of all other facts and circumstances, a reasonable person in the position of Employee would consider it important.  In the case of Employee s allegation of Good Reason, (A) Employee shall provide notice to the Company of the event alleged to constitute Good Reason within 60 days of the occurrence of such event, and (B) the Company shall have the opportunity to remedy the alleged Good Reason event within 30 days from receipt of notice of such allegation. 
  5.  Compensation Upon Termination  . 
  (a)  For Cause or Without Good Reason  .  In the event Employee s employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by the Employee without Good Reason, Employee shall be entitled to receive (i) Employee s full Base Salary through the Date of Termination at the rate then in effect, (ii) reimbursement of any expenses to the extent such amounts have accrued through the Date of Termination, (iii) pay for accrued but unused vacation existing as of the Date of Termination, and (iv) such employee benefits, if any, as to which Employee may be entitled pursuant to the terms governing such benefits (such amounts set forth in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) shall be collectively referred to herein as the    Accrued Rights   ). 
  (b)  Death or Disability  .

Employee and the Company further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this   Section   7, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Company irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law.

Either party may elect not to renew this Agreement;   provided  , that, if no Non-Renewal Notice is given, and if this Agreement is not terminated earlier in accordance with   Section   4, the Agreement will expire by its terms on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.  The term    Employment Term    means the period from the Effective Date until the expiration of the Initial Term and any applicable Renewal Period pursuant to this   Section   1 or in accordance with   Section   4 of this Agreement.

  (b)  Annual Bonus  .  Employee shall be eligible to receive one or more bonuses each year during the Employment Term to be determined by the Board (or a designated committee thereof), in its sole discretion based on performance or other criteria to be adopted by the Board (or a designated committee thereof).

The determination of whether Employee has a Disability shall be made in good faith by the person or persons required to make disability determinations under the long-term disability plan.  If Employee is not covered under the  
  
   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

Company s long-term disability plan or if the Company does not sponsor a long-term disability plan at such time, then the term  Disability  hereunder shall mean a  permanent and total disability  as defined in section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), and, in this case, the existence of any such Disability shall be certified by a physician acceptable to both the Company and Employee.  In the event the parties are not able to agree on the choice of a physician, each party shall select a physician who, in turn, shall select a third physician to render such certification. 
  (c)  Termination by the Company  .  The Company may terminate Employee s employment with or without Cause.

  (d)  Termination by Employee  .  Employee may, upon giving the Company no less than 30 days advance written notice, terminate Employee s employment without Good Reason or for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Good Reason    shall mean, without the express written consent of Employee, the occurrence of one of the following: (i) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement, (ii) a material     reduction in Employee s Base Salary, including any series of salary reductions (whether or not related) that are not agreed to by Employee in writing and that, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material reduction when compared to Employee s Base Salary in effect on the Effective Date or as adjusted after the Effective Date in accordance with   Section 3(a)   hereof or with Employee s prior written consent, (iii) a material diminution in Employee s authority, duties or responsibilities or the assignment of duties to Employee that are not materially commensurate with Employee s position with the Company, or (iv) a change in the geographic location at which Employee must normally perform services to a location outside of Midland     County, Texas.

  (e)  Treatment of Parachute Payments  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Employee is a  disqualified individual  (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), and the payments and benefits provided for in this Agreement, together with any other payments and benefits which Employee has the right to receive from the Company or any of its Affiliates, would result in a  parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the payments and benefits provided for in this Agreement shall be either (A) reduced (but not below zero) so that the present value of such total amounts and benefits received by Employee from the Company and its Affiliates will be one dollar ($1.00) less than three times Employee s  base amount  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) and so that no portion of such amounts and benefits received by Employee shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or (B) paid in full, whichever of (A) or (B) produces the better net after-tax position to Employee (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any other applicable taxes).  The reduction of payments and benefits hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing, first, payments or benefits to be paid in cash hereunder in the order in which such payment or benefit would be paid or provided (beginning with such payment or benefit that would be made last in time and continuing, to the extent necessary, through to such payment or benefit that would be made first in time) and, then, reducing any benefit to be provided in-kind hereunder in a similar order.  The determination as to whether any such reduction in the amount of the payments and benefits provided hereunder is necessary shall be made by the Company in good faith.  If a reduced payment or benefit is made or provided and through error or otherwise that payment or benefit, when aggregated with other payments and benefits from the Company (or its Affiliates) used in determining if a  parachute payment  exists, exceeds one dollar ($1.00) less than three times Employee s base amount, then Employee shall immediately repay such excess to the Company upon notification that an overpayment has been made.  Nothing in this   Section 5(e)   shall require the Company to be responsible for, or have any liability or obligation with respect to, Employee s excise tax liabilities under Section 4999 of the Code, if any. 
  (f)  No Other Amounts  .  Except as otherwise required by law (e.g., pursuant to COBRA) or as specifically provided herein, all of Employee s rights to Base Salary, severance, fringe benefits and bonuses hereunder (if any) shall cease upon the termination of the Employment Term.  Upon termination of the Employment Term, the sole contractual remedy of Employee and his successors, assigns, heirs, representatives and estate shall be to receive the amounts described in   Sections 5(a)  ,   5(b)  ,   5(c)  , and   5(d)  , as applicable. 
  (g)  Notice of Termination  .  Any termination of Employee s employment occurring in accordance with the terms of this   Section   5 (other than by reason of Employee s death or by reason of a Non-Renewal) shall be communicated to the other party by written notice that (i) indicates the specific termination provisions of this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for the termination, and (iii) specifies the Date of Termination (a    Notice of Termination   ), and that is delivered to the other party in accordance with   Section 9(f)   of this Agreement.  The failure of a party to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance that contributes to a showing of the basis for termination shall not waive any right of such party hereunder or later preclude such party from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing its rights hereunder. 
  (h)  Date of Termination  .  For purposes of this Agreement,    Date of Termination    means the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be;   provided  ,   however  , that if Employee s employment is terminated by reason of his death, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of Employee and in the event of a Non-Renewal, the Date of Termination shall be the last day of the Initial Term or applicable Renewal Period. 
  (i)  Deemed Resignations  .  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company and Employee prior to termination of Employee s employment, any termination of Employee s employment shall constitute an automatic resignation of Employee as an officer of the Company and each Affiliate of the Company, and an automatic resignation of the Employee from the Board.  Employee agrees to promptly execute and deliver to the Company all consents and agreements necessary to effectuate the termination of Employee s status as an officer and/or Employee s resignation from the Board.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall have no obligation hereunder to keep confidential any Confidential Information if and to the extent (i) such information becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Employee s violation of this   Section 6(b)  , or (ii) disclosure thereof is specifically required by law;   provided  ,   however  , that in the event disclosure is required by applicable law and Employee is making such disclosure, Employee shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such requirement, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give such notice prior to making any disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order, or (iii) Employee is making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity or is making disclosures that are otherwise compelled by law or provided under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law. 
  (c)  Remedies  .

Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this   Section   6, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including the recovery of damages from Employee and remedies available to the Company pursuant to other agreements with Employee. 
  (d)  No Prohibition  .  Nothing in this   Section   6 shall be construed as prohibiting Employee, following the expiration of the 12 month period immediately following Employee s termination of employment with the Company, from being employed by any Competing Business (as defined below) or engaging in any Prohibited Activity (as defined below);   provided  , that during such employment or engagement Employee complies with his obligations under this   Section   6. 
  (e)  Permitted Disclosures  .    Nothing herein will prevent Employee from: (i) making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity; or (ii) making disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law.  Further, an individual (including Employee) shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer of reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

(iii)     Restricted Area    means those geographic regions identified as areas of current exploration and areas of development activity in the Company s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as applicable, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The parties stipulate that the forgoing is a reasonable area restriction because the area identified is the market area with respect to which Employee will help the Company provide its products and services, help analyze, and/or receive access to Confidential Information.   
  (b)  Protective Covenants and Restrictions  .  Employee agrees that the following protective covenants are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company s legitimate business interests, do not create any undue hardship on Employee, and are not contrary to the public interest: 
  (i)  Non-compete  .  Employee expressly covenants and agrees that, during the Employment Term and for 12 months following termination of Employee s employment with the Company for any reason, he will not engage, directly or indirectly, in and he will not and will cause his Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control or participate in or be connected with, or loan money to or sell or lease equipment to, any Competing Business in the Restricted Area, other than pursuant to (A) any oil and gas properties (I) owned by Employee as of the Effective Date hereof or (II) acquired by Employee after the Effective Date pursuant to inheritance, bequest or  the laws of descent or distribution, or (B) any awards or other interests held by Employee, as of the Effective Date hereof or acquired thereafter, under any Incentive Plan.  In the event of Employee s termination of employment by the Company for Cause or by the Employee without Good Reason, this   Section 7(b)(i)   shall cease to apply as of Employee s Date of Termination, unless the Company continues to pay Employee his Base Salary in effect as of the Date of Termination for 12 months following termination of Employee s employment. 
  (ii)  Non-solicitation  .  Employee further expressly covenants and agrees that during the Employment Term and for 24 months following termination of Employee s employment with the Company for any reason, he will not and he will cause his Affiliates not to (A) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any individual who, on the Date of Termination, is an employee of the Company or its Affiliates to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual (other than employees of the Company or its Affiliates who respond to general advertisements for employment in newspapers or other periodicals of general circulation), or (B) cause, induce or encourage any actual or material prospective client, customer, supplier, landlord, lessor, or licensor of the Company or its Affiliates to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship that exists on the Date of Termination. 
  (c)  Permitted Ownership  .  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Employee may own, for investment purposes only, up to 5% of the outstanding stock or other equity securities of any publicly held corporation or other entity whose stock or equity securities are either listed on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System, if Employee is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation or entity and (ii) Employee is permitted to engage in the endeavors set forth on   Exhibit A   attached hereto. 
  (d)  Reasonableness  .  Employee and the Company agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in this   Section   7 are the result of arm s-length bargaining, are fair and reasonable, and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company in light of (i) the nature and wide geographic scope of the Company s operations; (ii) Employee s level of control over and contact with the Company s business in the Restricted Area; (iii) the fact that the Company s business is conducted throughout the Restricted Area; and (iv) the amount of compensation that Employee is receiving in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder.   
  (e)  Relief and Enforcement  .  Employee hereby represents to the Company that he has read and understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this   Section   7.  It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this   Section   7 be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, whether now or hereafter in effect.  However, to the extent that any part of this   Section   7 may be found invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been enforceable, and such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events.  Employee and the Company further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this   Section   7, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Company irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law.  Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, for any such breach or threatened breach. 
  (f)  Consulting and Litigation Assistance  .  Employee agrees that, during the period following Employee s Date of Termination during which Employee remains subject to the non-compete provisions of   Section 7(b)(i)   above, upon request from the Company, Employee will assist the Company in a consulting capacity and/or cooperate with the Company and its Affiliates in the defense of any claims or actions that may be made by or against the Company or any of its Affiliates that affect Employee s

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing sentence, in the event the Company requests Employee s assistance and/or cooperation pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  , Employee shall not be required to devote more than five (5) hours per month to assisting the Company pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  ;   provided  , that if, at the request of the Company, the Employee agrees to devote in excess of five (5) hours per month to assisting the Company pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  , then the Company will compensate Employee for each additional hour of assistance in excess of five (5) hours at an hourly rate of $250 per hour. 
  8.  Release of Claims  .    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in consideration for receiving the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable, Employee hereby agrees to execute (and not revoke) a general release of claims against the Company and its Affiliates (excluding claims for indemnification, claims for coverage under officer and director policies, and claims as a stockholder of the Company).  If Employee fails to properly execute and deliver such release (or revokes the release), Employee agrees that Employee shall not be entitled to receive the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable.

  (a)  Amendments and Waiver  .  The terms and provisions of this Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any of the provisions hereof be waived, temporarily or permanently, except pursuant to a written instrument executed by the party to be bound by such modification or amendment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
  (d)  Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to employment of Employee by the Company.

  (j)  Compensation Recoupment  .  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the    Act   ), the compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed fully earned or vested, even if paid or distributed to Employee, if such compensation or any portion thereof is deemed incentive compensation and subject to recovery, or  clawback,  by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or by any stock exchange on which the Company s common stock is listed (the    Rules   ).

  (b)  A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a  termination,   termination of employment  or like terms shall mean  separation from service.   Any payment following a separation from service that would be subject to Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code as a distribution following a separation from service of a  specified employee  (as defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) shall be made on the first to occur of (i) ten (10) days after the expiration of the six month period following such separation from service, (ii) death or (iii) such earlier date that complies with Section 409A of the Code.

  (b)  Protective Covenants and Restrictions  .  Employee agrees that the following protective covenants are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company s legitimate business interests, do not create any undue hardship on Employee, and are not contrary to the public interest:

  (ii)  Non-solicitation  .  Employee further expressly covenants and agrees that during the Employment Term and for 24 months following termination of Employee s employment with the Company for any reason, he will not and he will cause his Affiliates not to (A) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any individual who, on the Date of Termination, is an employee of the Company or its Affiliates to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual (other than employees of the Company or its Affiliates who respond to general advertisements for employment in newspapers or other periodicals of general circulation), or (B) cause, induce or encourage any actual or material prospective client, customer, supplier, landlord, lessor, or licensor of the Company or its Affiliates to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship that exists on the Date of Termination. 
  (c)  Permitted Ownership  .  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Employee may own, for investment purposes only, up to 5% of the outstanding stock or other equity securities of any publicly held corporation or other entity whose stock or equity securities are either listed on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System, if Employee is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation or entity and (ii) Employee is permitted to engage in the endeavors set forth on   Exhibit A   attached hereto. 
  (d)  Reasonableness  .  Employee and the Company agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in this   Section   7 are the result of arm s-length bargaining, are fair and reasonable, and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company in light of (i) the nature and wide geographic scope of the Company s operations; (ii) Employee s level of control over and contact with the Company s business in the Restricted Area; (iii) the fact that the Company s business is conducted throughout the Restricted Area; and (iv) the amount of compensation that Employee is receiving in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder.

It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this   Section   7 be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, whether now or hereafter in effect.  However, to the extent that any part of this   Section   7 may be found invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been enforceable, and such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events.  Employee and the Company further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this   Section   7, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Company irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law.  Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, for any such breach or threatened breach. 
  (f)  Consulting and Litigation Assistance  .  Employee agrees that, during the period following Employee s Date of Termination during which Employee remains subject to the non-compete provisions of   Section 7(b)(i)   above, upon request from the Company, Employee will assist the Company in a consulting capacity and/or cooperate with the Company and its Affiliates in the defense of any claims or actions that may be made by or against the Company or any of its Affiliates that affect Employee s

If Employee fails to properly execute and deliver such release (or revokes the release), Employee agrees that Employee shall not be entitled to receive the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable.

Any payment following a separation from service that would be subject to Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code as a distribution following a separation from service of a  specified employee  (as defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) shall be made on the first to occur of (i) ten (10) days after the expiration of the six month period following such separation from service, (ii) death or (iii) such earlier date that complies with Section 409A of the Code.

Employee and the Company agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in this   Section   7 are the result of arm s-length bargaining, are fair and reasonable, and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company in light of (i) the nature and wide geographic scope of the Company s operations; (ii) Employee s level of control over and contact with the Company s business in the Restricted Area; (iii) the fact that the Company s business is conducted throughout the Restricted Area; and (iv) the amount of compensation that Employee is receiving in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder.   
  (e)  Relief and Enforcement  .  Employee hereby represents to the Company that he has read and understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this   Section   7.  It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this   Section   7 be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, whether now or hereafter in effect.  However, to the extent that any part of this   Section   7 may be found invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been enforceable, and such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events.  Employee and the Company further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this   Section   7, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Company irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law.  Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, for any such breach or threatened breach. 
  (f)  Consulting and Litigation Assistance  .  Employee agrees that, during the period following Employee s Date of Termination during which Employee remains subject to the non-compete provisions of   Section 7(b)(i)   above, upon request

from the Company, Employee will assist the Company in a consulting capacity and/or cooperate with the Company and its Affiliates in the defense of any claims or actions that may be made by or against the Company or any of its Affiliates that affect Employee s prior areas of responsibility, except if Employee s reasonable interests are materially adverse to the Company or its Affiliates in such claim or action.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing sentence, in the event the Company requests Employee s assistance and/or cooperation pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  , Employee shall not be required to devote more than five (5) hours per month to assisting the Company pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  ;   provided  , that if, at the request of the Company, the Employee agrees to devote in excess of five (5) hours per month to assisting the Company pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  , then the Company will compensate Employee for each additional hour of assistance in excess of five (5) hours at an hourly rate of $250 per hour. 
  8.  Release of Claims  .

If Employee fails to properly execute and deliver such release (or revokes the release), Employee agrees that Employee shall not be entitled to receive the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable.  For purposes of this Agreement, a release shall be considered to have been executed by Employee if it is signed by Employee s legal representative, in the case of Employee s Disability, or on behalf of Employee s estate in the case of Employee s death.   
  9.  General Provisions  . 
  (a)  Amendments and Waiver  .  The terms and provisions of this Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any of the provisions hereof be waived, temporarily or permanently, except pursuant to a written instrument executed by the party to be bound by such modification or amendment.

  (j)  Compensation Recoupment  .  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the    Act   ), the compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed fully earned or vested, even if paid or distributed to Employee, if such compensation or any portion thereof is deemed incentive compensation and subject to recovery, or  clawback,  by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or by any stock exchange on which the Company s common stock is listed (the    Rules   ).  In addition, Employee hereby acknowledges that this Agreement may be amended to the minimum extent necessary and/or shall be subject to any recoupment policies adopted by the Company, including any policies to comply with the requirements and/or limitations under the Act and the Rules or any other federal or stock exchange requirements, including by expressly permitting (or, if applicable, requiring) the Company to revoke, recover, and/or clawback any compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement that is deemed incentive compensation.    
  10.  Section 409A of the Code  .  This Agreement is intended to either avoid the application of, or comply with, Section 409A of the Code.  To that end this Agreement shall at all times be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to adopt such amendments to this Agreement or take such other actions (including amendments and actions with retroactive effect) as it determines is necessary or appropriate for this Agreement to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  Further: 
  (a)  Any reimbursement of any costs and expenses by the Company to Employee under this Agreement shall be made by the Company in no event later than the close of Employee s taxable year following the taxable year in which the cost or expense is incurred by Employee.  The expenses incurred by Employee in any calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall not affect the expenses incurred by Employee in any other calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement hereunder and Employee s right to receive any reimbursement hereunder shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
  (b)  A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a  termination,   termination of employment  or like terms shall mean  separation from service.   Any payment following a separation from service that would be subject to Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code as a distribution following a separation from service of a  specified employee  (as defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) shall be made on the first to occur of (i) ten (10) days after the expiration of the six month period following such separation from service, (ii) death or (iii) such earlier date that complies with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 10(b) (whether they would have otherwise been payable

  NOW, THERFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree, effective as of the Restatement Effective Date (unless otherwise provided herein), as follows: 
  1.  Employment  .   The Company shall employ Employee, and Employee accepts employment with the Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary of such date (the    Initial Term      provided  ,   however  , that (a) on such third anniversary date (and on the fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the Effective Date thereafter), the term of this Agreement will automatically (without any action by either party) be extended for one additional year (each, a    Renewal Period   ), unless, at least 90 days prior to either the third, fourth, or fifth anniversary date of the Effective Date, as applicable, the Company or Employee has given written notice to the other party (a    Non-Renewal Notice   ) that the Company or Employee does not wish to extend the term of the Agreement (a    Non-Renewal   ), and (b) the Initial Term or any Renewal Period, as applicable, may be terminated prior to the expiration thereof in accordance with   Section   4.  Either party may elect not to renew this Agreement;   provided  , that, if no Non-Renewal Notice is given, and if this Agreement is not terminated earlier in accordance with   Section   4, the Agreement will expire by its terms on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.  The term    Employment Term    means the period from the Effective Date until the expiration of the Initial Term and any applicable Renewal Period pursuant to this   Section   1 or in accordance with   Section   4 of this Agreement. 
  2.  Position and Duties  . 
  (a)  During the Employment Term, Employee shall hold the title of Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer.  The Company and Employee agree that the Employee shall have duties and responsibilities consistent with the position set forth above in a company the size and of the nature of the Company, and such other duties and authority that are assigned to Employee from time to time by the Company s Board of Directors (the    Board   ), or such other officer of the Company as shall be designated by the Board.

  (c)  Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee owes a duty of loyalty, fidelity and allegiance to act at all times in the best interests of the Company and to do no intentional act that would injure the business, interests, or reputation of the Company or any of its Affiliates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee consents to the 20% reduction in Base Salary that became effective as of February 16, 2015 and agrees that such reduction in Base Salary is not and will not be considered a breach of this Agreement or any prior agreement and shall not constitute  Good Reason  for purposes of Section 4(d) of this Agreement or any prior agreement, even though such reduction continues in effect on and after the Effective Date. 
  (b)  Annual Bonus  .  Employee shall be eligible to receive one or more bonuses each year during the Employment Term to be determined by the Board (or a designated committee thereof), in its sole discretion based on performance or other criteria to be adopted by the Board (or a designated committee thereof).

  (c)  Employee Benefits  .

The Company shall not, however, by reason of this   Section 3(c)  , be obligated to institute, maintain, or refrain from changing, amending, or discontinuing any such benefit plan or program, so long as any such changes are similarly applicable to similarly situated employees of the Company. 
  (d)  Business Expenses  .  The Company shall reimburse Employee for all reasonable expenses incurred by him in the course of performing his duties under this Agreement to the extent consistent with the Company s written policies in effect from time to time with respect to travel, entertainment and other business expenses, subject to the Company s requirements with respect to reporting and documentation of such expenses.

Any grants previously awarded to Executive pursuant to the Company s APO Plans that are outstanding on the Effective Date hereof shall, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the APO Plans.  On and after the Effective Date employee may, as determined by the Board (or a designated committee thereof) in its sole discretion, receive grants of, or payments under, equity or non-equity related awards pursuant to the Company s Long Term Incentive Plan (the    LTIP   ) or any successor plan thereto.

  (a)  Death  .  Employee s employment hereunder shall terminate upon his death. 
  (b)  Disability  .  Employee s employment hereunder shall terminate upon a determination that he has incurred a Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,    Disability    means, at any time the Company sponsors a long-term disability plan for the Company s employees,  disability  as defined in such long-term disability plan for the purpose of determining a participant s eligibility for benefits,   provided  , that if the long-term disability plan contains multiple definitions of disability,  Disability  shall refer to that definition of disability which, if Employee qualified for such disability benefits, would provide coverage for the longest period of time.  The determination of whether Employee has a Disability shall be made in good faith by the person or  
  
   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

persons required to make disability determinations under the long-term disability plan.  If Employee is not covered under the Company s long-term disability plan or if the Company does not sponsor a long-term disability plan at such time, then the term  Disability  hereunder shall mean a  permanent and total disability  as defined in section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), and, in this case, the existence of any such Disability shall be certified by a physician acceptable to both the Company and Employee.  In the event the parties are not able to agree on the choice of a physician, each party shall select a physician who, in turn, shall select a third physician to render such certification. 
  (c)  Termination by the Company  .  The Company may terminate Employee s employment with or without Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Cause    means Employee (i) has been convicted of a misdemeanor that involves intentionally dishonest behavior or that the Company determines in good faith will have a material adverse effect on the reputation of the Company or any felony, (ii) has engaged in conduct which is materially injurious (monetarily or otherwise) to the Company or any of its Affiliates (including misuse of the Company s or an Affiliate s funds or other property), (iii) has engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his duties for the Company, (iv) has willfully refused without proper legal reason to perform his duties for the Company, (v) has intentionally breached any material provision of this Agreement or any other material agreement between the Company and Employee, or (vi) has intentionally breached any material corporate policy maintained and established by the Company that is of general applicability to executives of the Company;   provided  ,   however  , as to clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) contained in this   Section 4(c)  , if such acts or omissions could be cured by Employee (as reasonably determined by the Board), the Company must give Employee written notice of the acts or omissions constituting Cause within 30 days of the occurrence of such acts or omissions and, in such case, no termination shall be for Cause unless and until Employee fails to cure such acts or omissions within 30 days following receipt of such written notice. 
  (d)  Termination by Employee  .  Employee may, upon giving the Company no less than 30 days advance written notice, terminate Employee s employment without Good Reason or for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Good Reason    shall mean, without the express written consent of Employee, the occurrence of one of the following: (i) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement, (ii) a material     reduction in Employee s Base Salary, including any series of salary reductions (whether or not related) that are not agreed to by Employee in writing and that, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material reduction when compared to Employee s Base Salary in effect on the Effective Date or as adjusted after the Effective Date in accordance with   Section 3(a)   hereof or with Employee s prior written consent, (iii) a material diminution in Employee s authority, duties or responsibilities or the assignment of duties to Employee that are not materially commensurate with Employee s position with the Company, or (iv) a change in the geographic location at which Employee must normally perform services to a location outside of Midland     County, Texas.  For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction in Employee s Base Salary, regardless of amount, could be material if, in light of all other facts and circumstances, a reasonable person in the position of Employee would consider it important.  In the case of Employee s allegation of Good Reason, (A) Employee shall provide notice to the Company of the event alleged to constitute Good Reason within 60 days of the occurrence of such event, and (B) the Company shall have the opportunity to remedy the alleged Good Reason event within 30 days from receipt of notice of such allegation.

  (b)  Death or Disability  .  In the event Employee s employment terminates by reason of his death or Disability, Employee (or his estate) shall be entitled to receive the Accrued Rights and all outstanding equity and non-equity based awards (including any awards or interests under the APO Plans or the LTIP) held by Employee immediately prior to the Date of Termination shall become fully vested as of such date;   provided  ,   that  , notwithstanding the foregoing, any awards or interests held by Employee as of the Date of Termination under any APO Plan or the LTIP shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of such plans relating to the forfeiture of awards that are fully vested.  In addition, Employee shall be entitled to receive the following,   provided   Employee (or his estate) delivers to the Company, within 45 days following the Date of Termination, a properly executed release in accordance with   Section 8   of this Agreement: 
  (i)  a lump sum payment equal to 18 months  worth of Employee s Base Salary in effect on the Date of Termination (determined without regard to any reduction in Base Salary imposed by the Company in violation of   Section 3(a)   hereof), payable as soon as practicable but no later than the earlier of (A) March 15 following the calendar year in which termination occurs or (B) 90 days following the Date of Termination; and 
  
   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

(ii)  Employee (in the case of a termination due to Disability), his spouse and eligible dependents (to the extent covered immediately prior to such termination) shall continue to be eligible to participate in all of the Company s group health plans on the same terms and conditions as active employees of the Company for a period of one (1) year following the Date of Termination.  If benefits are continued pursuant to this   Section 5(b)(ii)   during a period when, in the absence of the benefits provided in this   Section 5(b)(ii)  , Employee or his dependents would not be entitled to continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code, Employee and his dependents shall receive reimbursement for all medical expenses no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the applicable expenses were incurred.  The health care continuation coverage period under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (   COBRA   ), Code Section 4980B, or any replacement or successor provision of United States tax law, shall run concurrently with the period during which continued benefits are being provided pursuant to this   Section 5(b)(ii)  . 
  (c)  Without Cause, For Good Reason or Non-Renewal  .

Employee and the Company further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this   Section   7, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Company irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law.

  (f)  Consulting and Litigation Assistance  .  Employee agrees that, during the period following Employee s Date of Termination during which Employee remains subject to the non-compete provisions of   Section 7(b)(i)   above, upon request from the Company, Employee will assist the Company in a consulting capacity and/or cooperate with the Company and its Affiliates in the defense of any claims or actions that may be made by or against the Company or any of its Affiliates that affect Employee s

Either party may elect not to renew this Agreement;   provided  , that, if no Non-Renewal Notice is given, and if this Agreement is not terminated earlier in accordance with   Section   4, the Agreement will expire by its terms on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.

  (b)  Annual Bonus  .  Employee shall be eligible to receive one or more bonuses each year during the Employment Term to be determined by the Board (or a designated committee thereof), in its sole discretion based on performance or other criteria to be adopted by the Board (or a designated committee thereof).

The determination of whether Employee has a Disability shall be made in good faith by the person or persons required to make disability determinations under the long-term disability plan.  If Employee is not covered under the  
  
   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

Company s long-term disability plan or if the Company does not sponsor a long-term disability plan at such time, then the term  Disability  hereunder shall mean a  permanent and total disability  as defined in section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), and, in this case, the existence of any such Disability shall be certified by a physician acceptable to both the Company and Employee.  In the event the parties are not able to agree on the choice of a physician, each party shall select a physician who, in turn, shall select a third physician to render such certification. 
  (c)  Termination by the Company  .  The Company may terminate Employee s employment with or without Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Cause    means Employee (i) has been convicted of a misdemeanor that involves intentionally dishonest behavior or that the Company determines in good faith will have a material adverse effect on the reputation of the Company or any felony, (ii) has engaged in conduct which is materially injurious (monetarily or otherwise) to the Company or any of its Affiliates (including misuse of the Company s or an Affiliate s funds or other property), (iii) has engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his duties for the Company, (iv) has willfully refused without proper legal reason to perform his duties for the Company, (v) has intentionally breached any material provision of this Agreement or any other material agreement between the Company and Employee, or (vi) has intentionally breached any material corporate policy maintained and established by the Company that is of general applicability to executives of the Company;   provided  ,   however  , as to clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) contained in this   Section 4(c)  , if such acts or omissions could be cured by Employee (as reasonably determined by the Board), the Company must give Employee written notice of the acts or omissions constituting Cause within 30 days of the occurrence of such acts or omissions and, in such case, no termination shall be for Cause unless and until Employee fails to cure such acts or omissions within 30 days following receipt of such written notice. 
  (d)  Termination by Employee  .  Employee may, upon giving the Company no less than 30 days advance written notice, terminate Employee s employment without Good Reason or for Good Reason.

  (e)  Treatment of Parachute Payments  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Employee is a  disqualified individual  (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), and the payments and benefits provided for in this Agreement, together with any other payments and benefits which Employee has the right to receive from the Company or any of its Affiliates, would result in a  parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the payments and benefits provided for in this Agreement shall be either (A) reduced (but not below zero) so that the present value of such total amounts and benefits received by Employee from the Company and its Affiliates will be one dollar ($1.00) less than three times Employee s  base amount  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) and so that no portion of such amounts and benefits received by Employee shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or (B) paid in full, whichever of (A) or (B) produces the better net after-tax position to Employee (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any other applicable taxes).  The reduction of payments and benefits hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing, first, payments or benefits to be paid in cash hereunder in the order in which such payment or benefit would be paid or provided (beginning with such payment or benefit that would be made last in time and continuing, to the extent necessary, through to such payment or benefit that would be made first in time) and, then, reducing any benefit to be provided in-kind hereunder in a similar order.  The determination as to whether any such reduction in the amount of the payments and benefits provided hereunder is necessary shall be made by the Company in good faith.  If a reduced payment or benefit is made or provided and through error or otherwise that payment or benefit, when aggregated with other payments and benefits from the Company (or its Affiliates) used in determining if a  parachute payment  exists, exceeds one dollar ($1.00) less than three times Employee s base amount, then Employee shall immediately repay such excess to the Company upon notification that an overpayment has been made.  Nothing in this   Section 5(e)   shall require the Company to be responsible for, or have any liability or obligation with respect to, Employee s excise tax liabilities under Section 4999 of the Code, if any. 
  (f)  No Other Amounts  .  Except as otherwise required by law (e.g., pursuant to COBRA) or as specifically provided herein, all of Employee s rights to Base Salary, severance, fringe benefits and bonuses hereunder (if any) shall cease upon the termination of the Employment Term.  Upon termination of the Employment Term, the sole contractual remedy of Employee and his successors, assigns, heirs, representatives and estate shall be to receive the amounts described in   Sections 5(a)  ,   5(b)  ,   5(c)  , and   5(d)  , as applicable. 
  (g)  Notice of Termination  .  Any termination of Employee s employment occurring in accordance with the terms of this   Section   5 (other than by reason of Employee s death or by reason of a Non-Renewal) shall be communicated to the other party by written notice that (i) indicates the specific termination provisions of this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for the termination, and (iii) specifies the Date of Termination (a    Notice of Termination   ), and that is delivered to the other party in accordance with   Section 9(f)   of this Agreement.  The failure of a party to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance that contributes to a showing of the basis for termination shall not waive any right of such party hereunder or later preclude such party from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing its rights hereunder. 
  (h)  Date of Termination  .  For purposes of this Agreement,    Date of Termination    means the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be;   provided  ,   however  , that if Employee s employment is terminated by reason of his death, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of Employee and in the event of a Non-Renewal, the Date of Termination shall be the last day of the Initial Term or applicable Renewal Period. 
  (i)  Deemed Resignations  .  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company and Employee prior to termination of Employee s employment, any termination of Employee s employment shall constitute an automatic resignation of Employee as an officer of the Company and each Affiliate of the Company, and an automatic resignation of the Employee from the Board.  Employee agrees to promptly execute and deliver to the Company all consents and agreements necessary to effectuate the termination of Employee s status as an officer and/or Employee s resignation from the Board.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall have no obligation hereunder to keep confidential any Confidential Information if and to the extent (i) such information becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Employee s violation of this   Section 6(b)  , or (ii) disclosure thereof is specifically required by law;   provided  ,   however  , that in the event disclosure is required by applicable law and Employee is making such disclosure, Employee shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such requirement, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give such notice prior to making any disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order, or (iii) Employee is making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity or is making disclosures that are otherwise compelled by law or provided under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law. 
  (c)  Remedies  .

Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this   Section   6, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including the recovery of damages from Employee and remedies available to the Company pursuant to other agreements with Employee. 
  (d)  No Prohibition  .  Nothing in this   Section   6 shall be construed as prohibiting Employee, following the expiration of the 12 month period immediately following Employee s termination of employment with the Company, from being employed by any Competing Business (as defined below) or engaging in any Prohibited Activity (as defined below);   provided  , that during such employment or engagement Employee complies with his obligations under this   Section   6. 
  (e)  Permitted Disclosures  .    Nothing herein will prevent Employee from: (i) making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity; or (ii) making disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law.  Further, an individual (including Employee) shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer of reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

(iii)     Restricted Area    means those geographic regions identified as areas of current exploration and areas of development activity in the Company s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as applicable, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The parties stipulate that the forgoing is a reasonable area restriction because the area identified is the market area with respect to which Employee will help the Company provide its products and services, help analyze, and/or receive access to Confidential Information.   
  (b)  Protective Covenants and Restrictions  .  Employee agrees that the following protective covenants are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company s legitimate business interests, do not create any undue hardship on Employee, and are not contrary to the public interest: 
  (i)  Non-compete  .  Employee expressly covenants and agrees that, during the Employment Term and for 12 months following termination of Employee s employment with the Company for any reason, he will not engage, directly or indirectly, in and he will not and will cause his Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control or participate in or be connected with, or loan money to or sell or lease equipment to, any Competing Business in the Restricted Area, other than pursuant to (A) any oil and gas properties (I) owned by Employee as of the Effective Date hereof or (II) acquired by Employee after the Effective Date pursuant to inheritance, bequest or  the laws of descent or distribution, or (B) any awards or other interests held by Employee, as of the Effective Date hereof or acquired thereafter, under any Incentive Plan.  In the event of Employee s termination of employment by the Company for Cause or by the Employee without Good Reason, this   Section 7(b)(i)   shall cease to apply as of Employee s Date of Termination, unless the Company continues to pay Employee his Base Salary in effect as of the Date of Termination for 12 months following termination of Employee s employment. 
  (ii)  Non-solicitation  .  Employee further expressly covenants and agrees that during the Employment Term and for 24 months following termination of Employee s employment with the Company for any reason, he will not and he will cause his Affiliates not to (A) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any individual who, on the Date of Termination, is an employee of the Company or its Affiliates to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual (other than employees of the Company or its Affiliates who respond to general advertisements for employment in newspapers or other periodicals of general circulation), or (B) cause, induce or encourage any actual or material prospective client, customer, supplier, landlord, lessor, or licensor of the Company or its Affiliates to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship that exists on the Date of Termination. 
  (c)  Permitted Ownership  .  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Employee may own, for investment purposes only, up to 5% of the outstanding stock or other equity securities of any publicly held corporation or other entity whose stock or equity securities are either listed on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System, if Employee is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation or entity and (ii) Employee is permitted to engage in the endeavors set forth on   Exhibit A   attached hereto. 
  (d)  Reasonableness  .  Employee and the Company agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in this   Section   7 are the result of arm s-length bargaining, are fair and reasonable, and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company in light of (i) the nature and wide geographic scope of the Company s operations; (ii) Employee s level of control over and contact with the Company s business in the Restricted Area; (iii) the fact that the Company s business is conducted throughout the Restricted Area; and (iv) the amount of compensation that Employee is receiving in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder.   
  (e)  Relief and Enforcement  .  Employee hereby represents to the Company that he has read and understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this   Section   7.  It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this   Section   7 be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, whether now or hereafter in effect.  However, to the extent that any part of this   Section   7 may be found invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been enforceable, and such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events.  Employee and the Company further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this   Section   7, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Company irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law.  Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, for any such breach or threatened breach. 
  (f)  Consulting and Litigation Assistance  .  Employee agrees that, during the period following Employee s Date of Termination during which Employee remains subject to the non-compete provisions of   Section 7(b)(i)   above, upon request from the Company, Employee will assist the Company in a consulting capacity and/or cooperate with the Company and its Affiliates in the defense of any claims or actions that may be made by or against the Company or any of its Affiliates that affect Employee s

  8.  Release of Claims  .    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in consideration for receiving the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable, Employee hereby agrees to execute (and not revoke) a general release of claims against the Company and its Affiliates (excluding claims for indemnification, claims for coverage under officer and director policies, and claims as a stockholder of the Company).  If Employee fails to properly execute and deliver such release (or revokes the release), Employee agrees that Employee shall not be entitled to receive the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable.  For purposes of this Agreement, a release shall be considered to have been executed by Employee if it is signed by Employee s legal representative, in the case of Employee s Disability, or on behalf of Employee s estate in the case of Employee s death.

  (a)  Amendments and Waiver  .  The terms and provisions of this Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any of the provisions hereof be waived, temporarily or permanently, except pursuant to a written instrument executed by the party to be bound by such modification or amendment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
  (d)  Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to employment of Employee by the Company.

  (j)  Compensation Recoupment  .  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the    Act   ), the compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed fully earned or vested, even if paid or distributed to Employee, if such compensation or any portion thereof is deemed incentive compensation and subject to recovery, or  clawback,  by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or by any stock exchange on which the Company s common stock is listed (the    Rules   ).

The expenses incurred by Employee in any calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall not affect the expenses incurred by Employee in any other calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement hereunder and Employee s right to receive any reimbursement hereunder shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
  (b)  A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a  termination,   termination of employment  or like terms shall mean  separation from service.   Any payment following a separation from service that would be subject to Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code as a distribution following a separation from service of a  specified employee  (as defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) shall be made on the first to occur of (i) ten (10) days after the expiration of the six month period following such separation from service, (ii) death or (iii) such earlier date that complies with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 10(b) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to Employee in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall have no obligation hereunder to keep confidential any Confidential Information if and to the extent (i) such information becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Employee s violation of this   Section 6(b)  , or (ii) disclosure thereof is specifically required by law;   provided  ,   however  , that in the event disclosure is required by applicable law and Employee is making such disclosure, Employee shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such requirement, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give such notice prior to making any disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order, or (iii) Employee is making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity or is making disclosures that are otherwise compelled by law or provided under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law. 
  (c)  Remedies  .  Employee acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this   Section   6 by Employee, and the Company or its Affiliates shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this   Section   6 by terminating payments then owing to Employee under this Agreement and/or by specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach.  Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this   Section   6, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including the recovery of damages from Employee and remedies available to the Company pursuant to other agreements with Employee. 
  (d)  No Prohibition  .  Nothing in this   Section   6 shall be construed as prohibiting Employee, following the expiration of the 12 month period immediately following Employee s termination of employment with the Company, from being employed by any Competing Business (as defined below) or engaging in any Prohibited Activity (as defined below);   provided  , that during such employment or engagement Employee complies with his obligations under this   Section   6. 
  (e)  Permitted Disclosures  .    Nothing herein will prevent Employee from: (i) making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity; or (ii) making disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law.  Further, an individual (including Employee) shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer of reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 
  7.  Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation  . 
  (a)  Definitions  .  As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
  (i)     Competing Business    means any business, individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other entity engaged in the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas. 
  (ii)     Prohibited Activity    means any service or activity on behalf of a Competing Business that involves the planning, management, supervision, or providing of services that are similar in nature or purpose to those services Employee provided to the Company within the last 12 months of Employee s employment with the Company or any other activities that would involve the use or disclosure of Confidential Information.   
  
   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

(iii)     Restricted Area    means those geographic regions identified as areas of current exploration and areas of development activity in the Company s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as applicable, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The parties stipulate that the forgoing is a reasonable area restriction because the area identified is the market area with respect to which Employee will help the Company provide its products and services, help analyze, and/or receive access to Confidential Information.   
  (b)  Protective Covenants and Restrictions  .  Employee agrees that the following protective covenants are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company s legitimate business interests, do not create any undue hardship on Employee, and are not contrary to the public interest: 
  (i)  Non-compete  .  Employee expressly covenants and agrees that, during the Employment Term and for 12 months following termination of Employee s employment with the Company for any reason, he will not engage, directly or indirectly, in and he will not and will cause his Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control or participate in or be connected with, or loan money to or sell or lease equipment to, any Competing Business in the Restricted Area, other than pursuant to (A) any oil and gas properties (I) owned by Employee as of the Effective Date hereof or (II) acquired by Employee after the Effective Date pursuant to inheritance, bequest or  the laws of descent or distribution, or (B) any awards or other interests held by Employee, as of the Effective Date hereof or acquired thereafter, under any Incentive Plan.  In the event of Employee s termination of employment by the Company for Cause or by the Employee without Good Reason, this   Section 7(b)(i)   shall cease to apply as of Employee s Date of Termination, unless the Company continues to pay Employee his Base Salary in effect as of the Date of Termination for 12 months following termination of Employee s employment. 
  (ii)  Non-solicitation  .  Employee further expressly covenants and agrees that during the Employment Term and for 24 months following termination of Employee s employment with the Company for any reason, he will not and he will cause his Affiliates not to (A) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any individual who, on the Date of Termination, is an employee of the Company or its Affiliates to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual (other than employees of the Company or its Affiliates who respond to general advertisements for employment in newspapers or other periodicals of general circulation), or (B) cause, induce or encourage any actual or material prospective client, customer, supplier, landlord, lessor, or licensor of the Company or its Affiliates to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship that exists on the Date of Termination. 
  (c)  Permitted Ownership  .  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Employee may own, for investment purposes only, up to 5% of the outstanding stock or other equity securities of any publicly held corporation or other entity whose stock or equity securities are either listed on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System, if Employee is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation or entity and (ii) Employee is permitted to engage in the endeavors set forth on   Exhibit A   attached hereto. 
  (d)  Reasonableness  .  Employee and the Company agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in this   Section   7 are the result of arm s-length bargaining, are fair and reasonable, and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company in light of (i) the nature and wide geographic scope of the Company s operations; (ii) Employee s level of control over and contact with the Company s business in the Restricted Area; (iii) the fact that the Company s business is conducted throughout the Restricted Area; and (iv) the amount of compensation that Employee is receiving in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder.   
  (e)  Relief and Enforcement  .  Employee hereby represents to the Company that he has read and understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this   Section   7.  It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this   Section   7 be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, whether now or hereafter in effect.  However, to the extent that any part of this   Section   7 may be found invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been enforceable, and such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events.  Employee and the Company further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this   Section   7, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Company irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law.  Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, for any such breach or threatened breach. 
  (f)  Consulting and Litigation Assistance  .  Employee agrees that, during the period following Employee s Date of Termination during which Employee remains subject to the non-compete provisions of   Section 7(b)(i)   above, upon request from the Company, Employee will assist the Company in a consulting capacity and/or cooperate with the Company and its Affiliates in the defense of any claims or actions that may be made by or against the Company or any of its Affiliates that affect Employee s  
  
   US 4716556v.2 
  doc.mmb/1473.docx 

prior areas of responsibility, except if Employee s reasonable interests are materially adverse to the Company or its Affiliates in such claim or action.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing sentence, in the event the Company requests Employee s assistance and/or cooperation pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  , Employee shall not be required to devote more than five (5) hours per month to assisting the Company pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  ;   provided  , that if, at the request of the Company, the Employee agrees to devote in excess of five (5) hours per month to assisting the Company pursuant to this   Section 7(f)  , then the Company will compensate Employee for each additional hour of assistance in excess of five (5) hours at an hourly rate of $250 per hour. 
  8.  Release of Claims  .    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in consideration for receiving the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable, Employee hereby agrees to execute (and not revoke) a general release of claims against the Company and its Affiliates (excluding claims for indemnification, claims for coverage under officer and director policies, and claims as a stockholder of the Company).  If Employee fails to properly execute and deliver such release (or revokes the release), Employee agrees that Employee shall not be entitled to receive the severance benefits described in   Sections 5(b)  ,   5(c)(iii)  ,   5(c)(iv)  ,   5(d)(i)C   and/or   5(d)(i)D  , as applicable.  For purposes of this Agreement, a release shall be considered to have been executed by Employee if it is signed by Employee s legal representative, in the case of Employee s Disability, or on behalf of Employee s estate in the case of Employee s death.   
  9.  General Provisions  . 
  (a)  Amendments and Waiver  .  The terms and provisions of this Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any of the provisions hereof be waived, temporarily or permanently, except pursuant to a written instrument executed by the party to be bound by such modification or amendment.  The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and shall not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 
  (b)  Withholding  .  The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any compensation, benefits, or amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, local or other taxes as may be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling. 
  (c)  Severability  .  It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
  (d)  Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to employment of Employee by the Company.  Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, all understandings and agreements preceding the date of execution of this Agreement and relating to the subject matter hereof, including any prior agreement, are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect. 
  (e)  Successors and Assigns  .  Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs and personal representatives and estates, as the case may be.  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder of any party may be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of the other party hereto;   provided  ,   however  , that the Company may assign this Agreement to any of its Affiliates.  Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person or legal entity other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 
  (f)  Notices  .  For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) when received, if delivered personally or by courier, (ii) on the date receipt is acknowledged, if delivered by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or (iii) one day after transmission, if sent by facsimile transmission with confirmation of transmission, as follows:

  or to such other address as either party may furnish to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices or changes of address shall be effective only upon receipt. 
  (g)  Construction  .  Where specific language is used to clarify by example a general statement contained herein, such specific language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the general statement to which it relates.  The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.   The word    including    means  including, without limitation.  
  (h)  Governing Law; Venue; Jury-Trial Waiver  .  The parties (i) agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicting provision or rule, except where federal law may preempt the application of state law; (ii) submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction, including removal jurisdiction, of the state and federal courts located in Midland County, Texas for any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or Employee s employment; (iii) waive any objection to such venue; (iv) agree that any judgment in any such action or proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions; and (v) IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND AGREE NOT TO ASK FOR A JURY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING.  
  (i)  Mutual Contribution  .  No provision of this Agreement shall be construed against any party on the grounds that such party drafted the provision or caused it to be drafted.  
  (j)  Compensation Recoupment  .  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the    Act   ), the compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed fully earned or vested, even if paid or distributed to Employee, if such compensation or any portion thereof is deemed incentive compensation and subject to recovery, or  clawback,  by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or by any stock exchange on which the Company s common stock is listed (the    Rules   ).  In addition, Employee hereby acknowledges that this Agreement may be amended to the minimum extent necessary and/or shall be subject to any recoupment policies adopted by the Company, including any policies to comply with the requirements and/or limitations under the Act and the Rules or any other federal or stock exchange requirements, including by expressly permitting (or, if applicable, requiring) the Company to revoke, recover, and/or clawback any compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement that is deemed incentive compensation.    
  10.  Section 409A of the Code  .  This Agreement is intended to either avoid the application of, or comply with, Section 409A of the Code.  To that end this Agreement shall at all times be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to adopt such amendments to this Agreement or take such other actions (including amendments and actions with retroactive effect) as it determines is necessary or appropriate for this Agreement to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  Further: 
  (a)  Any reimbursement of any costs and expenses by the Company to Employee under this Agreement shall be made by the Company in no event later than the close of Employee s taxable year following the taxable year in which the cost or expense is incurred by Employee.  The expenses incurred by Employee in any calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall not affect the expenses incurred by Employee in any other calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement hereunder and Employee s right to receive any reimbursement hereunder shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
  (b)  A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a  termination,   termination of employment  or like terms shall mean  separation from service.   Any payment following a separation from service that would be subject to Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code as a distribution following a separation from service of a  specified employee  (as defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) shall be made on the first to occur of (i) ten (10) days after the expiration of the six month period following such separation from service, (ii) death or (iii) such earlier date that complies with Section 409A of the Code.  Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 10(b) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to Employee in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
