BRIGHT HORIZONS FAMILY SOLUTIONS INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1.  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Organization   Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. ( Bright Horizons  or the  Company ) provides workplace services for employers and families throughout the United States and the United Kingdom, and also in Puerto Rico, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and India. Workplace services include center-based child care, education and enrichment programs, elementary school education, back-up dependent care (for children and elders), before and after school care, college preparation and admissions counseling, tuition reimbursement program management, and other family support services. 
  Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and the condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for the interim periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required in accordance with U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  In the opinion of the Company s management, the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and the condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for the interim periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of the interim periods presented.  The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. 
  Stock Offerings   On   January 30, 2013  , the Company completed an initial public offering (the  Offering ) and, after the exercise of the overallotment option on   February 21, 2013  , issued a total of   11.6 million   shares of common stock. Subsequent to the Offering, certain of the Company's shareholders sold shares of the Company's common stock in secondary offerings ( secondary offerings ) totaling   2.12 million   shares in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   9.65 million  ,   15.9 million  , and   9.8 million   shares in the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The Company did   not   receive proceeds from the sale of shares in the secondary offerings.  The Company purchased   1.0 million  ,   2.1 million   and   4.5 million   of the shares sold in the secondary offerings in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, from investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners, LLC at the same price per share paid by the underwriter to the selling shareholders. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners, LLC held approximately   24.6%   of our common stock. 
  On August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $300 million   of the Company s outstanding common stock, effective August 5, 2016.  The share repurchase program, which has no expiration date, replaces the prior   $250 million   authorization announced in February 2015, of which   $26.3 million   remained available at the date the program was replaced.  The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, under Rule 10b5-1 plans, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements    In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09:   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The amendments in this update simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods with early adoption permitted.  This update can be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on the consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This standard amends the existing guidance and requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with lease terms longer than twelve months. This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which provides guidance for revenue recognition.  The FASB has subsequently issued various ASUs which amend or clarify specific areas of  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

the guidance.  The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance.  These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and can be adopted using either a full retrospective or modified approach. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   and     ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   These standards were effective January 1, 2016, and did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company estimates that it will record amortization expense related to intangible assets existing as of   September 30, 2016   as follows over the next five years (in thousands): 

3.  ACQUISITIONS 
  As part of the Company s growth strategy to expand through strategic and synergistic acquisitions, the Company has made the following acquisitions in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The goodwill resulting from these acquisitions arises largely from synergies expected from combining the operations of the businesses acquired with our existing operations, as well as from benefits derived from gaining the related assembled workforce. 
  2016 Acquisitions 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   eight   centers in the United Kingdom in   three   separate business acquisitions, which were each accounted for as business combinations.  The centers were acquired for cash consideration of   $12.3 million   and contingent consideration of   $1.2 million  .  The Company recorded goodwill of   $11.1 million   related to the full service center-based care segment, which will not be deductible for tax purposes.  Intangible assets of   $2.5 million  , consisting primarily of customer relationships that will be amortized over   five   years, and a working capital deficit of   $0.9 million   were also recorded in relation to these acquisitions.   
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired a provider of back-up care in the United States, which was accounted for as a business combination.  The business was acquired for cash consideration of   $10.4 million   and contingent consideration of   $3.8 million  .  The Company recorded goodwill of   $9.8 million   related to the back-up care segment, which will not be deductible for tax purposes.  Intangible assets of   $4.6 million  , consisting primarily of the provider network that will be amortized over   five   years, technology of   $2.0 million  , and working capital of   $0.4 million   were also recorded in relation to this acquisition.   
  The allocation of purchase price consideration is based on preliminary estimates of fair value; such estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the purchase price allocations for these acquisitions remain open as the Company gathers additional information regarding the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The operating results for the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition, which were not material to the Company's financial results. 
  2015 Acquisitions 
  On   May 19, 2015  , the Company acquired Hildebrandt Learning Centers, LLC ( HLC ), an operator of   40   centers in the United States, for cash consideration of   $19.2 million   and contingent consideration of   $0.5 million  , which was accounted for as a business combination.  The Company recorded goodwill of   $13.2 million   related to the full service center-based care

segment, which will be deductible for tax purposes, and intangible assets of   $5.7 million  , consisting of customer relationships that will be amortized over   12 years  .  The Company also acquired working capital of   $0.3 million  , including cash of   $1.5 million  , and fixed assets of   $0.5 million  .  
  On   July 15, 2015  , the Company acquired Active Learning Childcare Limited ( ALC ), an operator of   nine   centers in the United Kingdom, for cash consideration of   $42.2 million  , which was accounted for as a business combination.  The Company recorded goodwill of   $31.1 million   related to the full service center-based care segment, which will not be deductible for tax purposes, and intangible assets of   $3.8 million  , consisting primarily of customer relationships that will be amortized over   five years  .  The Company also acquired a working capital deficit of   $1.8 million  , including cash of   $2.8 million  , fixed assets of   $9.8 million  , and deferred tax liabilities of   $0.7 million  .  
  Our acquisitions of HLC and ALC contributed approximately   $16.7 million   of revenue in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  During the   year ended December 31, 2015  , the Company also acquired   four   additional centers in the United States and   four   additional centers in the United Kingdom, in   six   separate business acquisitions which were each accounted for as business combinations.  The centers were acquired for cash consideration of   $20.5 million   and contingent consideration of   $0.8 million  , net of cash acquired of   $0.3 million  .  The Company recorded goodwill of   $18.5 million   related to the full service center-based care segment, a portion of which will be deductible for tax purposes.  Intangible assets of   $2.7 million  , consisting primarily of customer relationships that will be amortized over   five years  , were also recorded in relation to these acquisitions.  Contingent consideration of   $0.8 million   related to   one   of these acquisitions was paid during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The allocation of purchase price consideration is based on preliminary estimates of fair value; such estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the purchase price allocation for   one   of these   eight   acquisitions remains open as the Company gathers additional information regarding the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The operating results for the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisition, which were not material to the Company's financial results. 
   
  4.  CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS 
  The Company's   $1.2 billion   senior credit facilities consist of   $955.0 million   in secured term loan facilities and a   $225.0 million   revolving credit facility.   In conjunction with a debt refinancing in January 2013,   $790.0 million   in senior secured term loans were issued, with the subsequent issuance of   $165.0 million   in additional term loans in December 2014. The term loans mature on January 30, 2020.  
  Outstanding term loan borrowings were as follows at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):   

  On January 26, 2016, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility from   $100.0 million   to   $225.0 million  , to extend the maturity date on the revolving credit facility from   January 30, 2018   to   July 31, 2019  , and to modify the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility to a range of   1.25%   to   1.75%   over the base rate and   2.25%   to   2.75%   over the Eurocurrency rate.  Borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility were   $30.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $24.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  The effective interest rate for the term loans was   3.84%   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the weighted average interest rate was   3.95%   and   3.94%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The weighted average interest rate for the revolving credit facility was   4.4%   and   3.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  The Company incurred financing fees of   $15.4 million   and original issue discount costs of   $9.6 million   in connection with debt refinancings.  These fees are being amortized over the terms of the related debt instruments.  Amortization expense of deferred financing costs and original issue discount costs in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $0.6 million   and   $0.4 million  , and   $1.8 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, which are included in interest expense.

     Table of Contents  

Amortization expense of deferred financing costs and original issue discount costs in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million  , and   $1.6 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
  The future principal payments under the term loans at   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

On November 7, 2016, the Company modified its existing senior credit facilities by entering into an incremental and amendment and restatement agreement, which amended and restated the credit agreement and refinanced all of its outstanding term loans into a new   seven   year term loan facility, of which   $925.0 million   was funded on November 7, 2016 and   $200.0 million   will be available, subject to customary conditions, on a delayed draw basis for a three month period for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.  Borrowings under the new term loan facility bear interest rates ranging from   1.5%   to   1.75%   over the base rate or   2.5%   to   2.75%   over the Eurocurrency rate, which is the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate or, with applicable lender approval, the twelve month or less than one month LIBOR rate.  The base rate is subject to an interest rate floor of   1.75%   and the Eurocurrency rate is subject to an interest rate floor of   0.75%  .  The Company maintained its   $225.0 million   revolving credit facility and the interest rate, payment terms and availability of the revolving credit facility under the amended and restated credit agreement have not been modified.  
   
  5.  EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period.  
  Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, which requires the allocation of earnings to each class of common stock outstanding and to unvested stock-based payment awards that participate equally in dividends with common stock, also referred to herein as unvested participating shares.   
  The Company s unvested stock-based payment awards include unvested shares awarded as restricted stock awards at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors. The restricted stock awards generally vest at the end of   three years  .  
  Earnings per Share - Basic 
  The following table sets forth the computation of earnings per share using the two-class method for unvested participating shares (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):

     Table of Contents  

Earnings per Share - Diluted 
  The Company calculates diluted earnings per share for common stock using the more dilutive of (1) the treasury stock method, or (2) the two-class method. The following table sets forth the computation of diluted earnings per share using the   two-class   method for unvested participating shares (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):    

  Options outstanding to purchase   0.5 million   shares of common stock were excluded from diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   0.1 million   and   0.3 million   shares of common stock were excluded from diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, since their effect was anti-dilutive, which may be dilutive in the future. 
   
  6.  INCOME TAXES 
  The Company's effective income tax rates were   34.2%   and   34.6%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   34.4%   and   34.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective income tax rate is based upon estimated income before income taxes for the year, by jurisdiction, and estimated permanent tax adjustments.  The effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter for various reasons, including discrete items such as settlement of foreign, Federal and State tax issues.  
  The Company s unrecognized tax benefits were   $1.0 million   and   $0.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  There were no interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next twelve months if certain tax matters settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this time frame, or, if the applicable statutes of limitations lapse.  The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from   zero   to   $1.0 million  , exclusive of interest and penalties. 
  The Company and its domestic subsidiaries are subject to audit for U.S. Federal income tax as well as multiple state jurisdictions.  U.S. Federal income tax returns are typically subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and have a statute of limitations of   three years  ; therefore, tax filings for 2013 through 2015 are subject to audit.  An audit of a subsidiary's filing for 2013 began in the second quarter of 2015 and was settled in the second quarter of 2016 with no assessment.  
  State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of   three   to   four years   after filing of the respective return.  The state impact of any Federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states.  There were   three   state audits completed with no material adjustments during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   audits in process and the tax years from 2012 to 2015 are subject to audit.

The Company is also subject to corporate income tax at its subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, Canada, Ireland, and Puerto Rico.  The tax returns for the Company's subsidiaries located in foreign jurisdictions are subject to examination for periods ranging from   one   to   seven years  .  
   
  7.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The Company uses observable inputs where relevant and whenever possible. 
  Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. 
  Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. 
  Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
  The Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, revolving line of credit, and long-term debt.  The fair value of the Company s financial instruments, other than long-term debt, approximates their book value. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company's term loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows (in thousands):    

  The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments and a model that considers observable inputs. Judgment is required to develop these estimates. As such, our long-term debt is classified as Level 2, as defined by U.S. GAAP. 
   Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company mitigates its exposure by maintaining its cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions of high credit standing. The Company s accounts receivable, which are derived primarily from the services it provides, are dispersed across many clients in various industries with   no   single client accounting for more than   10%   of the Company s net revenue or accounts receivable.  The Company believes that   no   significant credit risk exists at   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  8.  SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  Bright Horizons' workplace services are primarily comprised of full service center-based child care, back-up dependent care, and other educational advisory services. Full service center-based care includes the traditional center-based child care, preschool, and elementary education, which have similar operating characteristics and meet the criteria for aggregation. Full service center-based care derives its revenues primarily from contractual arrangements with corporate clients and from tuition. The Company s back-up dependent care services consist of center-based back-up child care, in-home care, mildly ill care, and adult/elder care. The Company s other educational advisory services consists of the remaining services, including college preparation and admissions counseling, tuition reimbursement program administration, and related consulting services, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure and are not material for segment reporting individually or in the aggregate. The Company and its chief operating decision makers evaluate performance based on revenues and income from operations.

  Introduction and Overview 
  The following is a discussion of the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity and cash flows of Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. ( we  or the  Company ) for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and Notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Our business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations. Demand for child care and early education and elementary school services has historically decreased during the summer months when school is not in session, at which time families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements. In addition, our enrollment declines as older children transition to elementary schools. Demand for our services generally increases in September and October coinciding with the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the school year. In addition, use of our back-up dependent care services tends to be higher when schools are not in session and during holiday periods, which can increase the operating costs of the program and impact the results of operations. Results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of, among other things, the performance of existing centers, including enrollment and staffing fluctuations, the number and timing of new center openings, acquisitions and management transitions, the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability, center closings, refurbishment or relocation, the contract model mix (profit and

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue.    Revenue   increased     $18.0 million  , or   5%  , to   $383.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $365.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Revenue growth is primarily attributable to contributions from new and ramping child care and early education centers, expanded sales of our back-up dependent care services and educational advisory services, and typical annual tuition increases of   3-4%  .  Revenue generated by the full service center-based care segment in the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $11.3 million  , or   4%  , when compared to the same period in   2015  , due in part to overall enrollment increases of approximately   5%  , partially offset by the effect of lower foreign exchange rates for our United Kingdom operations which reduced revenue growth in the full service segment by approximately 3%.  At   September 30, 2016  , we operated   940   child care and early education centers compared to   928   centers at   September 30, 2015  .  
  Revenue generated by back-up dependent care services in the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $5.3 million  , or   11%  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .  Additionally, revenue generated by other educational advisory services in the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $1.4 million  , or   13%  , when compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Cost of Services.    Cost of services   increased     $11.9 million  , or   4%  , to   $292.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $280.6 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Cost of services in the full service center-based care segment   increased     $5.6 million  , or   2%  , to   $254.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  . Personnel costs, which typically represent approximately 70% of total cost of services for this segment, increased   2%   when compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of enrollment growth at new and existing centers, routine wage and benefit cost increases, and labor costs associated with centers we have added since   September 30, 2015   that are in the ramping stage. In addition, program supplies, materials, food and facilities costs, which typically represent approximately 30% of total costs of services for this segment, increased   3%   in connection with the enrollment growth and the incremental occupancy costs associated with centers that have been added since   September 30, 2015  .  Cost of services in the back-up dependent care segment   increased     $4.7 million  , or   17%  , to   $32.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily for investments in information technology and personnel, and increased care provider fees associated with the services provided to the expanding revenue base.  Cost of services in the other educational advisory services segment   increased     $1.6 million  , or   37%  , to   $5.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to personnel and technology costs related to the incremental sales of these services. 
  Gross Profit.    Gross profit   increased     $6.1 million  , or   7%  , to   $91.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $85.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was   24%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to 23% for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in gross profit is primarily due to contributions from new and acquired centers, increased enrollment in our mature and ramping profit and loss centers, effective operating cost management, and expanded other educational advisory services.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SGA").    SGA increased   $3.2 million  , or   9%  , to   $39.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $36.4 million   for the same period in   2015  , and was   10%   of revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which is consistent with the same period in   2015  .  SGA increased over the comparable   2015   period due to increases in personnel costs including annual wage increases, continued investments in technology and routine increases in other SGA costs. 
  Amortization.    Amortization expense on intangible assets of   $7.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased from   $7.2 million   for the same period in   2015   due to decreases from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the period offset by increases from the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016. 
  Income from Operations.    Income from operations   increased   by   $3.0 million  , or   7%  , to   $44.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  .  Income from operations was   12%   of revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which is consistent with the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in income from operations was due to the following: 
             
    In the full service center-based care segment, income from operations   increased     $3.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  . Income from operations increased over the comparable period due to tuition increases and enrollment gains over the prior year as well as contributions from new centers that have been added since   September 30, 2015  , and effective cost management, partially offset by the costs incurred during the ramp-up of certain new lease/consortium centers opened during 2015 and 2016. 
                
    Income from operations for the back-up dependent care segment   increased     $0.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the expanding revenue base partially offset by investments in information technology and personnel, and increased care provider fees associated with the incremental revenue.

Income from operations in the other educational advisory services segment   decreased     $0.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to incremental personnel and technology costs associated with expanding these services to additional customers.  
     Net Interest Expense and Other.    Net interest expense and other increased to   $10.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $10.3 million   for the same period in   2015   due to borrowings on our line of credit in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Income Tax Expense.    We recorded income tax expense of   $11.7 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $10.9 million   during the comparable period in   2015   at an effective rate of   34%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   35%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The difference between the effective income tax rates is primarily attributable to a higher proportion of profit before tax in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Income from Operations.    Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income from operations   increased     $5.0 million  , or   8%  , and   $3.0 million  , or   7%  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   over the same period in   2015   primarily as a result of the increase in gross profit due to additional contributions from full-service centers, including the impact of new and acquired centers, as well as growth in other educational advisory services. 
  Adjusted Net Income.    Adjusted net income   increased     $2.8 million  , or   10%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to the incremental gross profit described above. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue.    Revenue   increased     $84.5 million  , or   8%  , to   $1.2 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $1.1 billion   for the same period in   2015  .  Revenue growth is primarily attributable to contributions from new and ramping child care and early education centers, expanded sales of our back-up dependent care services and educational advisory services, and typical annual tuition increases of   3-4%  .  Revenue generated by full service center-based care services in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $66.1 million  , or   7%  , when compared to the same period in   2015  , due in part to overall enrollment increases of   6%  , partially offset by the effect of lower foreign exchange rates for our United Kingdom operations which reduced revenue growth in the full service segment by approximately 2% for the nine month period.  Our acquisitions of Hildebrandt Learning Centers ("HLC"), an operator of 40 centers in the United States on May 19, 2015, and Active Learning Childcare Limited ("ALC"), an operator of 9 centers in the United Kingdom on July 15, 2015, contributed approximately   $24.5 million   of incremental revenue in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Revenue generated by back-up dependent care services in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $12.1 million  , or   9%  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .  Additionally, revenue generated by other educational advisory services in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $6.3 million  , or   23%  , when compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Cost of Services.    Cost of services   increased     $60.7 million  , or   7%  , to   $879.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $819.0 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Cost of services in the full service center-based care services segment   increased     $45.3 million  , or   6%  , to   $777.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  .  Personnel costs increased   7%   as a result of the increase in overall enrollment, routine wage and benefit cost increases, and labor costs associated with centers we have added since   September 30, 2015   that are in the ramping stage.  In addition, program supplies, materials, food and facilities costs increased   5%   in connection with the enrollment growth and the incremental occupancy costs associated with centers that have been added since   September 30, 2015  .  Cost of services in the back-up dependent care segment   increased     $11.4 million  , or   15%  , to   $84.9 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily for investments in information technology and personnel, and increased care provider fees associated with the higher levels of back-up services provided.  Cost of services in the other educational advisory services segment   increased   by   $4.0 million  , or   30%  , to   $17.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to personnel and technology costs related to the incremental sales of these services. 
  Gross Profit.    Gross profit   increased     $23.7 million  , or   9%  , to   $291.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $267.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was   25%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which is consistent with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in gross profit is primarily due to contributions from new and acquired centers, increased enrollment in our mature and ramping profit and loss centers, effective operating cost management, and expanded other educational advisory services. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    SGA   increased     $10.2 million  , or   9%  , to   $120.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $110.2 million   for the same period in   2015  , and was   10%   of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   consistent with the same period in   2015  .  Results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately   $0.8 million   of costs related to secondary offerings, the January 2016 amendment to the Credit

     Table of Contents  

Agreement, and completed acquisitions compared to   $0.5 million   of costs related to secondary offerings included in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  After taking these charges into account, SGA increased over the comparable   2015   period due to increases in personnel costs including annual wage increases, continued investments in technology and routine increases in other SGA costs. 
  Amortization.    Amortization expense on intangible assets of   $21.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased from   $21.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 offset by decreases from certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the period. 
  Income from Operations.    Income from operations   increased   by   $13.2 million  , or   10%  , to   $149.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  .  Income from operations was   13%   of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which is consistent with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   was due to the following: 
             
    In the full service center-based care segment, income from operations   increased     $12.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  .  Income from operations increased over the comparable period due to tuition increases and enrollment gains over the prior year as well as contributions from new centers that have been added since   September 30, 2015  , and effective cost management, partially offset by the costs incurred during the ramp-up of certain new lease/consortium centers opened during   2015   and 2016. 
                
    Income from operations for the back-up dependent care segment   decreased     $0.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to investments in information technology and personnel, and increased care provider fees associated with services provided to the expanding revenue base. 
                
    Income from operations in the other educational advisory services segment   increased     $0.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the expanding revenue base.  
     Net Interest Expense and Other.    Net interest expense and other   increased   to   $31.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $30.7 million   for the same period in   2015   due to borrowings on our line of credit in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Income Tax Expense.    We recorded an income tax   expense   of   $40.8 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to an income tax   expense   of   $36.0 million   during the comparable period in   2015  .  The effective rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   34%  .  We expect that the annual effective rate in 2016 to approximate 34%.  
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Income from Operations.    Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income from operations   increased     $17.9 million  , or   9%  , and   $13.4 million  , or   10%   respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   over the comparable period in   2015   primarily as a result of the increase in gross profit due to additional contributions from full-service centers, including the impact of new and acquired centers, as well as the growth in other educational advisory services. 
  Adjusted Net Income.    Adjusted net income   increased     $10.6 million  , or   12%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to the incremental gross profit described above.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
  In our quarterly and annual reports, earnings press releases and conference calls, we discuss key financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per share are as follows (in thousands, except share data):   

            (b) 
    Represents rent expense in excess of cash paid for rent, recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840,   Leases  . 
              (c) 
    Represents non-cash stock-based compensation expense. 
              (d) 
    Represents costs incurred in connection with the January 2016 amendment to the Credit Agreement, secondary offerings and completed acquisitions. 
              (e) 
    Represents income tax expense calculated on adjusted income before tax at the year to date effective rate of approximately   35%   and   36%   in   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, and the use of the terms adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations. We present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share as supplemental performance measures because we believe they facilitate a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under GAAP, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA allows for an assessment of our operating performance and of our ability to service or incur indebtedness without the effect of non-cash charges, such as depreciation, amortization, the excess of rent expense over cash rent expense and stock-based compensation expense, as well as the expenses related to secondary offerings, debt financing transaction expenses, and acquisitions. In addition, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share allow us to assess our performance without the impact of the specifically identified items that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations. These non-GAAP measures also function as key performance indicators used to evaluate our operating performance internally, and they are used in connection with the determination of incentive compensation for management, including executive officers.  Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to income before taxes, net income, diluted earnings per common share, net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company understands that although adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, they have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
             
    adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income do not fully reflect the Company s cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company s working capital needs; 
                
    adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt; 
                
    although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future; and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
     Because of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary cash requirements are for the ongoing operations of our existing child care centers, back-up dependent care services and other educational advisory services, the addition of new centers through development or acquisition and debt financing obligations.  Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility.  Borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $30.0 million   and   $24.0 million  , respectively. 
  The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the Company does not currently expect that the effects of continued potentially unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a material net impact on the Company's liquidity, capital resources or results from operations for the remainder of 2016.  We had   $19.5 million   in cash at   September 30, 2016  , of which $14.3 million was held in foreign jurisdictions.  Additionally, operations outside of North America accounted for 19% of the Company's consolidated revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  We had a working capital   deficit   of   $163.0 million   and   $152.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   Our working capital   deficit   has arisen from using cash generated from operations to make long-term investments in fixed assets and acquisitions and from share repurchases.  We anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that the cash generated will be used principally to fund ongoing operations of our new and existing full service child care centers and expanded operations in the back-up dependent care and other educational advisory segments, as well as to make scheduled principal and interest payments and for share repurchases.

The Company's   $1.2 billion   senior credit facilities consist of $955.0 million in secured term loan facilities and a   $225.0 million   revolving credit facility.  In conjunction with a debt refinancing in January 2013,   $790.0 million   in senior secured term loans were issued, with the subsequent issuance of $165.0 million in additional term loans in December 2014.  On January 26, 2016, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to   $225.0 million  .   
  On November 7, 2016, the Company modified its existing senior credit facilities by entering into an incremental and amendment and restatement agreement, which amended and restated the credit agreement and refinanced all of its outstanding term loans into a new seven year term loan facility, of which $925.0 million was funded on November 7, 2016 and $200.0 million will be available, subject to customary conditions, on a delayed draw basis for a three month period for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.  The Company also maintained its $225.0 million revolving credit facility.  The amended and restated credit agreement is further discussed below under  Debt  and in Item 5 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   
  On February 4, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $250.0 million repurchase program of its common stock.  The repurchase program had no expiration date and replaced the prior 2014 authorization under which $221.6 million was repurchased.  On August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to $300.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, effective August 5, 2016.  The share repurchase program, which has no expiration date, replaces the February 2015 authorization under which   $223.7 million   was repurchased.  The Company repurchased   1.5 million   shares of common stock for   $95.8 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   under these authorizations.  All repurchased shares have been retired.  
  We believe that funds provided by operations, our existing cash balances and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions.  However, if we were to undertake any significant acquisitions or investments in the purchase of facilities for new or existing child care and early education centers, which requires financing beyond our existing borrowing capacity, it may be necessary for us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.  We may not be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms, or at all.  
  Cash Flows   

  Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Cash provided by operating activities was $  165.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $142.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted from changes in working capital arising from an increase in collections due to timing and growth, lower cash tax payments in the period, the timing of other routine operating expenses, and the timing of routine tenant improvement allowances.  In addition, the increase in net income contributed   $7.6 million  , which was partially offset by changes in non-cash items. 
  Cash Used in Investing Activities 
  Cash used in investing activities was   $72.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and was primarily related to fixed asset additions for new child care centers, maintenance and refurbishments in our existing centers, and continued investments in technology, equipment and furnishings. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company used   $22.3 million   to acquire eight centers in the United Kingdom and a franchisor of back-up care in the United States.  Cash used in investing activities was   $128.1 million   for the same period in   2015   and primarily related to fixed asset additions for new child care centers, maintenance and refurbishments in our existing centers, and continued investments in technology, equipment and furnishings.  The Company acquired 54 centers for   $66.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

Cash Used in Financing Activities 
  Cash used in financing activities amounted to   $83.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $80.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , share repurchases totaled   $95.7 million  , taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock awards were   $7.7 million  , and principal payments on our debt were   $7.2 million  .  These uses of cash were offset by proceeds from the tax benefit on stock-based compensation of   $10.5 million  , the exercise of options to purchase common stock of   $9.1 million  , net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of   $6.0 million  , and proceeds from the issuance and sale of restricted stock of   $3.7 million  .  Cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   consisted principally of share repurchases of   $117.5 million  , and principal payments on our debt of   $7.2 million  .  These uses of cash were offset by proceeds from net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of   $26.5 million  , the exercise of options to purchase common stock of   $7.5 million  , the tax benefit of stock-based compensation in the amount of   $6.4 million  , and proceeds from the issuance and sale of restricted stock of   $3.9 million  . 
  Debt 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's   $1.2 billion   senior credit facilities consisted of $955.0 million in secured term loan facilities and a   $225.0 million   revolving credit facility.  The term loans mature on January 30, 2020 and require quarterly principal payments of $2.4 million, with the remaining principal balance due on January 30, 2020.  
  Outstanding term loan borrowings were as follows at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):   

  On January 26, 2016, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to   $225.0 million  , to extend the maturity date on the revolving credit facility from January 30, 2018 to July 31, 2019, and to modify the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility to a range of 1.25% to 1.75% over the base rate and 2.25% to 2.75% over the Eurocurrency rate.  Borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility were   $30.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $24.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  On November 7, 2016, the Company modified its existing senior credit facilities by entering into an incremental and amendment and restatement agreement, which amended and restated the credit agreement and refinanced all of its outstanding term loans into a new seven year term loan facility, of which $925.0 million was funded on November 7, 2016 and $200.0 million will be available, subject to customary conditions, on a delayed draw basis for a three month period for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.   
  Borrowings under the new term loan facility bear interest rates ranging from 1.5% to 1.75% over the base rate or 2.5% to 2.75% over the Eurocurrency rate, which is the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate or, with applicable lender approval, the twelve month or less than one month LIBOR rate.  The base rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.75% and the Eurocurrency rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 0.75%.  The Company maintained its $225.0 million revolving credit facility and the interest rate, payment terms and availability of the revolving credit facility under the amended and restated credit agreement have not been modified.    
  All obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company's U.S. based subsidiaries.  The newly amended and restated credit agreement governing the $1.35 billion senior secured credit facilities contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, may restrict the ability of Bright Horizons Family Solutions LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and its restricted subsidiaries, to: incur certain liens; make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions; incur additional indebtedness or guarantees; pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; alter the business conducted; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries  ability to pay dividends; and consolidate or merge.  
  In addition, the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities requires Bright Horizons Capital Corp., our direct subsidiary, to be a passive holding company, subject to certain exceptions.  The revolving credit facility requires Bright Horizons Family Solutions LLC, the borrower, and its restricted subsidiaries to comply with a maximum senior secured first lien net leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant, to be tested only if, on the last day of each fiscal quarter,

revolving loans and/or swing-line loans in excess of a specified percentage of the revolving commitments on such date are outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  The breach of this covenant is subject to certain equity cure rights. 
  The credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.  The financial covenants were not required to be tested as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency rate fluctuations.  Since   December 31, 2015  , there have been no material changes in the Company s exposures to interest rate or foreign currency rate fluctuations.  See Part II, Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further information regarding market risk.  The Company currently does not enter into derivatives or other market risk sensitive instruments for the purpose of hedging or for trading purposes.  
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).  The term "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were not effective as of   September 30, 2016   due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
  Remediation of the Material Weakness 
  As disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at December 31, 2015.  As of December 31, 2014, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change management related to certain information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and system of internal control over financial reporting. While the Company implemented a number of remediation efforts over the course of fiscal 2015 with respect to the identified deficiencies, as discussed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the material weakness had not been remediated as of December 31, 2015.  
  We are actively engaged in completing the remediation plan that was implemented in 2015 to ensure that controls contributing to this material weakness are designed appropriately and also operate effectively.  We expect that our remediation efforts will continue through 2016, although the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable internal controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
  Notwithstanding the identified material weakness and the conclusion above that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   September 30, 2016  , management believes that the consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting, except for our remediation efforts described above.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  We are, from time to time, subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which have not been fully adjudicated.  Such claims have in the past generally been covered by insurance.  We believe the resolution of such legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions.  Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover all liabilities that may arise out of claims brought against us. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The table below sets forth information regarding the Company's repurchases of its common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)  
    On   February 4, 2015  , the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to   $250 million   of its common stock.  The repurchase program had no expiration date and replaced the prior share repurchase authorization from March 2014.  On August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to $300 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, effective August 5, 2016.  The share repurchase program, which has no expiration date, replaced the February 2015 authorization.  All repurchased shares have been retired.   
      
  Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
  Not applicable. 
   
  Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
  Not applicable. 
   
  Item 5. Other Information 
  On November 7, 2016 (the  Effective Date ), Bright Horizons Family Solutions LLC (the  Borrower ), Bright Horizons Capital Corp. ( Holdings ), Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as successor administrative agent and L/C issuer and each Incremental Term Lender (as defined therein) modified the Company s existing senior credit facilities by entering into an Incremental and Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the  Amendment ), which amended and restated the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2013, among the Borrower, Holdings, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the Lenders (as defined therein) and the other parties party thereto from time to time (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2014, the Incremental Joinder to Credit Agreement, dated as of December 9, 2014 and the Extension and Incremental Amendment, dated as of January 26, 2016, the  Existing Credit Agreement ) (the senior credit facilities as so amended and restated, the  Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ). 
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

Pursuant to the Amendment, among other changes, the Borrower refinanced all of its outstanding term loans into a new seven year term loan facility, of which $925.0 million was funded on the Effective Date and $200.0 million will be available, subject to customary conditions, on a delayed draw basis for a three month period beginning on the Effective Date for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Any term loans borrowed on a delayed draw basis after the Effective Date will be part of the same class as, and fungible with, the term loans borrowed on the Effective Date.  The Company maintains its $225.0 million revolving credit facility and the interest rate, payment terms and availability of the revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement have not been modified.   
  Borrowings under the new term loan facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 150 to 175 basis points over the Base Rate or 250 to 275 basis points over the Eurocurrency Rate as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  The Eurocurrency Rate option is the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate, as selected by the Borrower, or, with the approval of the applicable lenders, twelve or less than one month LIBOR rate.  The Base Rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.75% and the Eurocurrency Rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 0.75%.  The new term loan facility requires scheduled quarterly amortization payments (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017), each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the loans under the new term loan facility (including any loans made on a delayed draw basis after the Effective Date).  Beginning thirty days after the Effective Date, unused commitments on the delayed draw portion of the new term loan facility will accrue a commitment fee equal to the applicable margin for Eurocurrency Rate term loans plus the 75 basis point Eurocurrency Rate floor. 
  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires the same mandatory prepayments as provided under the Existing Credit Agreement, except that the excess cash flow prepayment will commence with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 and there is no cap on reinvestment of the net cash proceeds from asset sales under the general disposition basket.  Voluntary prepayments of the new term loan facility in connection with a Repricing Transaction, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, on or prior to six months after the Effective Date will be subject to a call premium of 1.0%.  Otherwise, outstanding loans under the new term loan facility may be voluntarily prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. 
  Certain of the Lenders and certain of their affiliates have performed investment banking, commercial lending and underwriting services for the Company, the Borrower, their subsidiaries and their respective affiliates, from time to time, for which they have received customary fees and expenses. These parties may, from time to time, engage in transactions with, and perform services for the Company, the Borrower, their subsidiaries or their respective affiliates in the ordinary course of their business.

Exhibit 31.1  
  CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BRIGHT HORIZONS FAMILY SOLUTIONS INC.  
  I, David Lissy, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.;  
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed     under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
