CAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS REGARDING
ESTIMATES OF MEASURED, INDICATED AND INFERRED RESOURCES AND PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES  

International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. ( we ,  us ,
 our,   ITH  or the  Company ) is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition
and exploration of mineral properties. As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms  mineral reserve ,
 proven mineral reserve  and  probable mineral reserve  are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance
with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ( NI 43-101 ) and the Canadian
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the  CIM ) CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral
Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. These definitions differ from the definitions in the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Industry Guide 7 ( SEC Industry Guide 7 ). Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards,
a  final  or  bankable  feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average
price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves, and the primary environmental analysis or report must
be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms  mineral resource ,  measured mineral
resource ,  indicated mineral resource  and  inferred mineral resource  are defined in and required
to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted
to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part
of a mineral deposit in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. 

Inferred mineral resources  have a great amount
of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that
all, or any part, of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of
inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are
cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. 

Disclosure of  contained ounces  in a resource is
permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does
not constitute  reserves  by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly,
information contained in this report and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain descriptions of our mineral deposits
that may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements
under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

The term  mineralized material  as used in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, although permissible under SEC Industry Guide 7, does not indicate  reserves  by
SEC Industry Guide 7 standards. We cannot be certain that any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted
into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant  reserves . Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized
material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE TO ALL INVESTORS CONCERNING
ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS THAT INCLUDE INFERRED RESOURCES  

The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests
in an advanced stage exploration project in Alaska referred to as the Livengood Gold Project (the  Livengood Gold Project 
or the  Project ). Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. The preliminary
assessments on the Project are preliminary in nature and include  inferred mineral resources  that have a great amount
of uncertainty as to their existence, and are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to
them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. It cannot be assumed that all, or any part, of an inferred mineral
resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form
the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies. There is no certainty that such inferred mineral resources at the Project
will ever be realized. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is
economically or legally mineable. 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements or information within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 concerning anticipated results and developments in the operations of the Company in future periods, planned
exploration activities, the adequacy of the Company s financial resources and other events or conditions that may occur in
the future. Forward-looking statements are frequently, but not always, identified by words such as  expects,   anticipates, 
 believes,   intends,   estimates,   potential,   possible  and similar
expressions, or statements that events, conditions or results  will,   may,   could  or  should 
(or the negative and grammatical variations of any of these terms) occur or be achieved. These forward looking statements may include,
but are not limited to, statements concerning: 

the Company s future cash requirements, the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations as they come due
(including payment of the derivative liability due in January 2017), and the Company s ability to be able to raise the necessary
funds to continue operations on acceptable terms, if at all;   

the proceeds from any sale of the claims related to the derivative liability being sufficient to satisfy the payment due in
January 2017;   

the potential for opportunities to improve recovery or further reduce costs at the Livengood Gold
Project;   

the
                                         Company s ability to potentially include the results of the optimization process
                                         in a new or updated feasibility study or any future financial analysis of the Project,
                                         and the estimated cost of such optimization process;    

the
                                         Company s ability to carry forward and incorporate into future engineering studies
                                         of the Project updated mine design, production schedule, and recovery concepts identified
                                         during the optimization process;    

the potential for the Company to carry out an engineering phase that will evaluate and optimize the Project configuration and
capital and operating expenses, including determining the optimum scale for the Project;   

the Company s strategies and objectives, both generally and specifically in respect of the Livengood Gold Project;   

the Company s belief that there are no known environmental issues that are anticipated to materially impact the Company s
ability to conduct mining operations at the Project;   

the potential for the expansion of the estimated resources at the Livengood Gold Project;   

the potential for a production decision concerning, and any production at, the Livengood Gold Project;   

the sequence of decisions regarding the timing and costs of development programs with respect to, and the issuance of the necessary
permits and authorizations required for, the Livengood Gold Project;   

the Company s estimates of the quality and quantity of the resources at the Livengood Gold Project;   

the timing and cost of any future exploration programs at the Livengood Gold Project, and the timing of the receipt of results
therefrom; and   

future general business and economic conditions, including changes in the price of gold and the overall sentiment of the markets
for public equity.   

Such forward-looking statements reflect the Company s
current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance
or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, among others: 

the demand for, and level and volatility of the price of, gold;   

conditions in the financial markets generally, the overall sentiment of the markets for public equity, interest rates and currency
rates;   

general business and economic conditions;   

government regulation and proposed legislation (and changes thereto or interpretations thereof);   

defects in title to claims, or the ability to obtain surface rights, either of which could affect the Company s property
rights and claims;   

the Company s ability to secure the necessary services and supplies on favorable terms in connection with its programs
at the Livengood Gold Project and other activities;   

the Company s ability to attract and retain key staff, particularly in connection with the permitting and development
of any mine at the Livengood Gold Project;   

the accuracy of the Company s resource estimates (including with respect to size and grade) and the geological, operational
and price assumptions on which these are based;   

the timing of the ability to commence and complete planned work programs at the Livengood Gold Project;   

the timing of the receipt of and the terms of the consents, permits and authorizations necessary to carry out exploration and
development programs at the Livengood Gold Project and the Company s ability to comply with such terms on a safe and cost-effective
basis;   

the ongoing relations of the Company with the lessors of its property interests and applicable regulatory agencies;   

the metallurgy and recovery characteristics of samples from certain of the Company s mineral properties and whether such
characteristics are reflective of the deposit as a whole; and   

the continued development of and potential construction of any mine at the Livengood Gold Project property not requiring consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits that are materially different from those identified by the Company.   

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein. This list is
not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company s forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
are statements about the future and are inherently uncertain, and actual achievements of the Company or other future events or
conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties
and other factors, including without limitation those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are incorporated herein by reference, as well as other factors described elsewhere
in this report and the Company s other reports filed with the SEC. 

The Company s forward-looking statements contained in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management as of the date of this report.
The Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management s beliefs,
expectations or opinions should change, except as required by law. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not attribute
undue certainty to or place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

     NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 
     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
 
     (Expressed in US dollars   Unaudited)  

1.    GENERAL INFORMATION, NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN    

International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. ( ITH 
or the  Company ) is incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. The Company s head office address
is 2300-1177 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 

International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. consists of ITH and
its wholly owned subsidiaries Tower Hill Mines, Inc. ( TH Alaska ) (an Alaska corporation), Tower Hill Mines (US) LLC
( TH US ) (a Colorado limited liability company), Livengood Placers, Inc. ( LPI ) (a Nevada corporation),
and 813034 Alberta Ltd. (an Alberta corporation). The Company is in the business of acquiring, exploring and evaluating mineral
properties, and either joint venturing or developing these properties further or disposing of them when the evaluation is completed.
At September 30, 2016, the Company was in the exploration stage and controls a 100% interest in its Livengood Gold Project in Alaska,
U.S.A. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which presumes the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in
the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. 

As at September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and
cash equivalents of $1,759,123 compared to $6,493,486 at December 31, 2015. The Company has no revenue generating operations from
which it can internally generate funds. As at September 30, 2016, the Company s estimate of the amount of the Additional
Payment due on January 12, 2017 (see Note 6) is $14,800,000, which significantly exceeds the Company s available cash resources.
The Company expects to seek to obtain significant additional financing on or before January 2017 in order to be able to make this
payment, but there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing required on acceptable terms,
if at all. 

Should the Company be unable to make the Additional Payment,
the Company will have 30 days to remedy the event of default. Should the default not be remedied, the Company may be required to
deliver the underlying claims, which are not part of the Project s gold resource but are part of the 75 square mile Livengood
land package, into a trust in order for them to be sold. Should the proceeds from sale not be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding
amount of the Additional Payment, the beneficiaries will have recourse against the Company for any shortfall. The Company considers
it likely that the proceeds from any such sale, should it prove necessary, would be sufficient to satisfy the amount of the Additional
Payment. 

The Company will also require significant additional financing
to continue its operations in connection with advancing activities at the Livengood Gold Project and for the development of any
mine that may be determined to be built at the Livengood Gold Project. In addition, any significant delays in the issuance of required
permits for the ongoing work at the Livengood Gold Project, or unexpected results in connection with the ongoing work, could result
in the Company being required to raise additional funds to advance permitting efforts. The Company s review of its financing
options includes pursuing a strategic alliance to assist in further development, permitting and future construction costs. 

Despite the Company s success to date in raising
significant equity financing to fund its operations, there is significant uncertainty that the Company will be able to secure any
additional financing in the current or future equity markets. Even if the Company is able to secure some additional equity financing,
the Company may be unable to raise enough capital to both make the Additional Payment and continue its operations in connection
with advancing all activities at the Livengood Gold Project into 2017 and beyond. As a result, there is substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The amount of funds to be raised and the terms of any proposed equity financing that
may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities to raise funds arise. Specific plans related to the use of
proceeds will be devised once financing has been completed and management knows what funds will be available for these purposes.
Due to this uncertainty, if the Company is unable to secure sufficient additional financing, it may be unable to make the Additional
Payment when due, and the Company may be required to reduce all discretionary activities at the Project to preserve its working
capital to fund anticipated non-discretionary expenditures beyond the 2016 fiscal year.

INTERNATIONAL TOWER HILL MINES LTD.  
 
     (An Exploration Stage Company)  
 
     NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 
     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
 
     (Expressed in US dollars   Unaudited)  

These financial statements do not reflect the adjustments
to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and balance sheet classifications that would be necessary
were the going concern adjustment appropriate. Such adjustments could be material. 

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for
annual financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the opinion of the Company s management these financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position at September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations
for the nine months then ended.  Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The 2015 year-end balance sheet data was derived from
audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based
on management s experience and knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances. While management believes the estimates
to be reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and could impact future results of operations and cash flows. 

On November 14, 2016, the Board approved these condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. 

Basis of consolidation  

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of ITH and its wholly owned subsidiaries TH Alaska, TH US, LPI and 813034 Alberta Ltd. All intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. 

3.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these financial
instruments. 

Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified
into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;   

Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly;
and   

Level 3   Inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Livengood Gold Project
Property  

The Livengood property is located
in the Tintina gold belt approximately 113 kilometers (70 miles) northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The property consists of land
leased from the Alaska Mental Health Trust, a number of smaller private mineral leases, Alaska state mining claims purchased or
located by the Company and patented ground held by the Company. 

Details of the leases are as follows: 

a)  a lease of the Alaska Mental Health Trust mineral rights having a term beginning July 1, 2004 and extending 19 years until
June 30, 2023, subject to further extensions beyond June 30, 2023 by either commercial production or payment of an advance minimum
royalty equal to 125% of the amount paid in year 19 and diligent pursuit of development. The lease requires minimum work expenditures
and advance minimum royalties (all of which minimum royalties are recoverable from production royalties) which escalate annually
with inflation. A net smelter return ( NSR ) production royalty of between 2.5% and 5.0% (depending upon the price
of gold) is payable to the lessor with respect to the lands subject to this lease. In addition, an NSR production royalty of l%
is payable to the lessor with respect to the unpatented federal mining claims subject to the lease described in b) below and an
NSR production royalty of between 0.5% and 1.0% (depending upon the price of gold) is payable to the lessor with respect to the
lands acquired by the Company as a result of the purchase of Livengood Placers, Inc. in December 2011. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and from the inception of this lease the Company has paid $326,776 and $2,302,666, respectively.

are recoverable from production royalties). An NSR production royalty of 3% is payable to the lessors. The Company may purchase
all interests of the lessors in the leased property (including the production royalty) for $1,000,000 (less all minimum and production
royalties paid to the date of purchase), of which $500,000 is payable in cash over four years following the closing of the purchase
and the balance of $500,000 is payable by way of the 3% NSR production royalty. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and from the inception of this lease the Company has paid $20,000 and $165,000, respectively.   

d)  a lease of unpatented federal lode mining and federal unpatented placer claims having an initial term of ten years commencing
on March 28, 2007, and continuing for so long thereafter as advance minimum royalties are paid and mining related activities, including
exploration, continue on the property or on adjacent properties controlled by the Company. The lease requires an advance minimum
royalty of $15,000 on or before each anniversary date (all of which minimum royalties are recoverable from production royalties).
The Company is required to pay the lessor the sum of $250,000 upon making a positive production decision, payable $125,000 within
120 days of the decision and $125,000 within a year of the decision (all of which are recoverable from production royalties). An
NSR production royalty of 2% is payable to the lessor. The Company may purchase all of the interest of the lessor in the leased
property (including the production royalty) for $1,000,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and from the inception
of this lease the Company has paid $15,000 and $113,000, respectively.   

Title to mineral properties  

The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a
detailed and time-consuming process. The Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest.
Although the Company has taken every reasonable precaution to ensure that legal title to its properties is properly recorded in
the name of the Company, there can be no assurance that such title will ultimately be secured.

5.    ACCRUED LIABILITIES    

The following table presents the accrued liabilities balances
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Accrued liabilities at September 30, 2016 include accruals
for general corporate costs and project costs of $33,420 and $255,031, respectively. Accrued liabilities at December 31, 2015 include
accruals for general corporate costs and project costs of $27,535 and $219,499, respectively. 

6.    DERIVATIVE LIABILITY    

During 2011, the Company acquired certain mining claims
and related rights in the vicinity of the Livengood Gold Project located near Fairbanks, Alaska. The aggregate consideration for
the claims and rights was $13,500,000 in cash plus an additional payment based on the five-year average daily gold price ( Average
Gold Price ) from the date of the acquisition ( Additional Payment ). The Additional Payment will equal $23,148
for every dollar that the Average Gold Price exceeds $720 per troy ounce. If the Average Gold Price is less than $720, there will
be no additional consideration due. 

At initial recognition on December 13, 2011 the derivative
liability was valued at $23,100,000. The key assumption used in the valuation of the derivative is the estimate of the future Average
Gold Price. The estimate of the future Average Gold Price was determined using a forward curve on future gold prices as published
by the CME Group. Using this forward curve, the Company estimated an Average Gold Price based on actual gold prices to September
30, 2016 and projected gold prices from September 30, 2016 to the end of the five year period on December 13, 2016 of $1,360 per
ounce of gold. 

The fair value of the derivative liability and the estimated
Average Gold Price are as follows:

Stock options  

The Company adopted an incentive
stock option plan in 2006, as amended September 19, 2012 and reapproved on May 28, 2015 at the Company s Annual General Meeting
(the  2006 Plan ). The essential elements of the 2006 Plan provide that the aggregate number of common shares of the
Company s capital stock that may be made issuable pursuant to options granted under the 2006 Plan may not exceed 10% of the
number of issued shares of the Company at the time of the granting of the options. Options granted under the 2006 Plan will have
a maximum term of ten years. The exercise price of options granted under the 2006 Plan shall be fixed in compliance with the applicable
provisions of the TSX Company Manual in force at the time of grant and, in any event, shall not be less than the closing price
of the Company s common shares on the TSX on the trading day immediately preceding the day on which the option is granted,
or such other price as may be agreed to by the Company and accepted by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Options granted under the 2006
Plan vest immediately, unless otherwise determined by the directors at the date of grant. 

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016,
there were no incentive stock options granted by the Company.

9.    COMMITMENTS  

The following table discloses, as of September 30, 2016,
the Company s contractual obligations including anticipated mineral property payments and work commitments. Under the terms
of the Company s mineral property purchase agreements, mineral leases and the terms of the unpatented mineral claims held
by it, the Company is required to make certain scheduled acquisition payments, incur certain levels of expenditures, make lease
or advance royalty payments, make payments to government authorities and incur assessment work expenditures as summarized in the
table below in order to maintain and preserve the Company s interests in the related mineral properties. If the Company is
unable or unwilling to make any such payments or incur any such expenditure, it is likely that the Company would lose or forfeit
its rights to acquire or hold the related mineral properties. The following table assumes that the Company retains the rights to
all of its current mineral properties, but does not exercise any lease purchase or royalty buyout options: 

2.  Does not include required work expenditures, as it is assumed that the required expenditure level is significantly below the
level of work that will actually be carried out by the Company. Does not include potential royalties that may be payable (other
than annual minimum royalty payments). See Note 4.   

10.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

In December 2011, in accordance with a Stock and Asset
Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) between the Company, Alaska/Nevada Gold Mines, Ltd. ( AN Gold Mines )
and the Heflinger Group, the Company acquired certain mining claims and related rights in the vicinity of the Livengood Gold Project
located near Fairbanks, Alaska. The Company s derivative liability, as described in Note 6 above, represents the remaining
consideration for the purchase of these claims and related rights and is payable in January 2017. Under the Agreement, the payment
is due 70% to AN Gold Mines and 30% to the Heflinger Group. 

Mr. Hanneman was appointed Chief Operating Officer of
the Company on March 26, 2015. Mr. Hanneman is a partner of the general partner, as well as a limited partner, of AN Gold Mines
and holds an 11.9% net interest in AN Gold Mines.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. All currency amounts are stated in US dollars unless noted otherwise. 

Current Business Activities  

General  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and to the date
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company progressed on a number of opportunities identified in the September 2013 Study
and opportunities subsequently developed by the Company with the potential for optimization and reducing the costs of building
and operating a mine at the Project. 

Livengood Gold Project   Pre-feasibility Study Results   

The Company announced the results of a Pre-feasibility Study
( 2016 PFS ) on September 8, 2016. On October 24, 2016, the Company filed a technical report on SEDAR that summarizes
the results of the 2016 PFS on the Livengood Gold Project. The technical report is entitled  NI 43-101 Technical Report Pre-feasibility
Study of the Livengood Gold Project, Livengood, Alaska,  dated September 8, 2016 and signed October 24, 2016. The Report
is based on an updated resource estimate effective as of August 26, 2016 and has an optimized Project configuration and throughput
of 52,600 t/d (47,700 mt/d) compared to the 100,000 t/d (90,700 mt/d) Project evaluated in the September 2013 Feasibility Study.
Using the trailing three year gold price of $1,250 per ounce, the Project generates a negative project NPV of $-552M at a 5% discount
rate and an IRR of 0.5% after mining and income taxes. 

As a result of the changes to the Project as evaluated in the
2016 PFS, the original project as evaluated in the September 2013 Study is no longer considered current and investors should no
longer rely upon the September 2013 Study. The Company cautions that the 2016 PFS is preliminary in nature, and is based on technical
and economic assumptions which would be further refined and evaluated in a full feasibility study. There can be no certainty that
the results estimated in the 2016 PFS will be realized. 

Next Steps and Opportunities  

The 2016 PFS identified additional optimization opportunities
with the potential to improve recovery or further reduce costs, either of which could result in improvement to the Project. Subject
to available financing, these opportunities will be pursued to better define overall project economics prior to initiation of a
full feasibility study. These opportunities include improvements to the project geologic models to better support metallurgical
modelling, development of a grade-shell resource model with the potential to support a mine production schedule with improved economics,
and continuing to advance metallurgical test work to optimize the flowsheet and evaluate whether recovery can be improved. Environmental
work will continue in order to support project development and maintain continuity of baseline information. 

It is estimated that the optimization studies and supporting
field work would cost approximately $6.3M. 

Results of Operations   

Summary of Quarterly Results  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The Company incurred a net loss of $1,524,589 for the three
month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $1,007,489 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. 

16   

Mineral property expenditures decreased $199,360 to $528,117
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $727,477 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the
Company nearing completion of the planned multi-phase metallurgical test work program and limiting field activities to continuation
of critical environmental baseline studies. 

Excluding share-based payment charges of $11,757 and $61,943,
respectively, wages and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $526,115 from $595,971 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a staffing reduction and severance payment related to the Colorado office closure. 

Consulting fees were $63,973 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $82,091 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $18,118 is primarily due to lower share-based
payment charges. 

Share-based payment charges  

Share-based payment charges for the three month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were allocated as follows: 

Share-based payment charges were $16,293 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $86,319 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $70,026 in share-based
payment charges during the period was mainly the result of a reduction in the fair value of options granted in 2015 as compared
to 2014. 

Most other expense categories reflected moderate decreases period
over period reflecting the Company s efforts to reduce spending. 

Other items amounted to a loss of $91,386 during the three month
period ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $741,725 during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. Total other
loss resulted from the unrealized loss on the revaluation of the derivative liability of $100,000. This unrealized loss was caused
by the increase in the price per ounce of gold during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and is compared to an unrealized
gain of $400,000 during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The Company had a foreign exchange loss of $3,020 during
the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $334,228 during the three month period ended September 30,
2015 as a result of the impact of exchange rates on certain of the Company s U.S. dollar cash balances. The average exchange
rate during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was C$1 to US$0.7663 compared to C$1 to US$0.7640 for the three month
period ended September 30, 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The Company incurred a net loss of $6,080,895 for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $3,692,852 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 

Mineral property expenditures increased $547,265 to $2,504,284
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,957,019 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the
Company moving forward with the planned multi-phase metallurgical test work program, partially offset by limiting field activities
to continuation of critical environmental baseline studies. Consulting and professional fees for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $173,981 to $355,667 from the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 as the Company negotiated lower
rates in 2016 for various third party-provided professional fees such as legal and accounting fees. 

Excluding share-based payment charges of $65,410 and $331,831,
respectively, wages and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $1,564,625 from $1,630,877 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a staffing reduction and severance payment related to the Colorado office closure 

17   

Share-based payment charges  

Share-based payment charges for the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were allocated as follows: 

Share-based payment charges were $92,587 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $448,310 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $355,723 in share-based
payment charges during the period was primarily the result of a reduction in the fair value of options granted in 2015 as compared
to 2014. The Company granted no options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2,135,200 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Remaining other expense categories reflected moderate decreases
period over period reflecting the Company s efforts to reduce spending. 

Other items amounted to a loss of $969,655 during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $1,462,245 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. Total other
loss resulted from the unrealized loss on the revaluation of the derivative liability of $900,000. This unrealized loss was caused
by the increase in the price per ounce of gold during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and is compared to an unrealized
gain of $500,000 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The Company had a foreign exchange loss of $124,784 during
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to a foreign exchange gain of $905,123 during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2015. The average exchange rate during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was C$1 to US$0.7565 compared
to C$1 to US$0.7936 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity Risk and Capital Resources   

The Company has no revenue generating operations from which
it can internally generate funds. To date, the Company s ongoing operations have been predominantly financed through sale
of its equity securities by way of private placements and the subsequent exercise of share purchase and broker warrants and options
issued in connection with such private placements. However, the exercise of warrants/options is dependent primarily on the market
price and overall market liquidity of the Company s securities at or near the expiry date of such warrants/options (over
which the Company has no control) and therefore there can be no guarantee that any existing warrants/options will be exercised.
There are currently no warrants outstanding. 

As at September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents
of $1,759,123 compared to $6,493,486 at December 31, 2015. The decrease of approximately $4.7 million resulted mainly from expenditures
on the Livengood Gold Project of approximately $5.0 million offset by a positive foreign currency translation impact of approximately
$0.3 million. 

Financing activities during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 provided $15,404 on the issuance of common shares as a result of the exercise of stock options. The Company had no cash
flows from financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company had no cash flows from investing activities during
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

As at September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital
deficit of $13,367,057 compared to working capital of $6,169,233 at December 31, 2015. The negative working capital is mainly the
result of the reclassification of the contingent derivative payment to a current liability. The Company expects that it will operate
at a loss for the foreseeable future, but believes the current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient for it to complete
its anticipated 2016 work plan at the Livengood Gold Project. To advance the Livengood Gold Project towards permitting and development,
the Company anticipates maintaining certain essential development activities for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. These
essential activities include maintaining environmental baseline data that in its absence could materially delay future permitting
of the Livengood Gold Project. 

Management s intent is to secure additional financing
if market conditions warrant, or possibly enter into a strategic alliance to continue its operations (including general and administrative
expenses) in connection with advancing activities at the Livengood Gold Project, making the contingent payment due in January 2017,
and the development of any mine that may be determined to be built at the Livengood Gold Project. Although past performance does
not dictate future results, the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past. 

There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain
the additional financing required on acceptable terms, if at all. As at September 30, 2016, the Company s estimate of the
amount of the contingent payment is $14,800,000. This contingent payment, which is due in January 2017, significantly exceeds the
Company s available cash resources, and therefore the Company will be required to secure significant additional financing
on or before January 2017 in order to be able to make this payment. See Note 1 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016. In addition, any significant delays in the issuance of required
permits for the ongoing work at the Livengood Gold Project, or unexpected results in connection with the ongoing work, could result
in the Company being required to raise additional funds to advance permitting efforts. The Company s review of its financing
options includes pursuing a future strategic alliance to assist in further development, permitting and future construction costs. 

18   

Despite the Company s success to date in raising significant
equity financing to fund its operations, there is significant uncertainty that the Company will be able to secure any additional
financing in the current or future equity markets. See  Risk Factors   We will require additional financing to fund
exploration and, if warranted, development and production. Failure to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operation and could cast uncertainty on our ability to continue as a going concern 
in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Even if the Company is
able to secure some additional equity financing, the Company may be unable to raise enough capital to both make the contingent
payment and continue its operations in connection with advancing all activities at the Livengood Gold Project into 2017 and beyond.
The quantity of funds to be raised and the terms of any proposed equity financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by
management as opportunities to raise funds arise. Specific plans related to the use of proceeds will be devised once financing
has been completed and management knows what funds will be available for these purposes. Due to this uncertainty, if the Company
is unable to secure sufficient additional financing, it may be unable to make the contingent payment when due, and the Company
may be required to reduce all discretionary activities at the Project to preserve its working capital to fund anticipated non-discretionary
expenditures for the remainder of the 2016 fiscal year. 

Other than cash held by its subsidiaries for their immediate
operating needs in the United States, all of the Company s cash reserves are on deposit with a major Canadian chartered bank.
The Company does not believe that the credit, liquidity or market risks with respect thereto have increased as a result of the
current market conditions. 

Contractual Obligations  

The following table discloses, as of September 30, 2016, the
Company s contractual obligations including anticipated mineral property payments and work commitments. Under the terms of
the Company s mineral property purchase agreements, mineral leases and the terms of the unpatented mineral claims held by
it, the Company is required to make certain scheduled acquisition payments, incur certain levels of expenditures, make lease or
advance royalty payments, make payments to government authorities and incur assessment work expenditures as summarized in the table
below in order to maintain and preserve the Company s interests in the related mineral properties. If the Company is unable
or unwilling to make any such payments or incur any such expenditure, it is likely that the Company would lose or forfeit its rights
to acquire or hold the related mineral properties. The following table assumes that the Company retains the rights to all of its
current mineral properties, but does not exercise any lease purchase or royalty buyout options: 

2.  Does not include required work expenditures, as it is assumed that the required expenditure level is significantly below the
level of work that will actually be carried out by the Company. Does not include potential royalties that may be payable (other
than annual minimum royalty payments).   

Other   Related Party Transactions  

In December 2011, in accordance with a Stock and Asset Purchase
Agreement (the  Agreement ) between the Company, Alaska/Nevada Gold Mines, Ltd. ( AN Gold Mines ) and the
Heflinger Group, the Company acquired certain mining claims and related rights in the vicinity of the Livengood Gold Project located
near Fairbanks, Alaska. The Company s derivative liability, as described in Note 6 of the financial statements for the period
ended September 30, 2016, represents the remaining consideration for the purchase of these claims and related rights and is payable
in January 2017. Under the Agreement, the payment is due 70% to AN Gold Mines and 30% to the Heflinger Group. 

Mr. Hanneman was appointed Chief Operating Officer of the Company
on March 26, 2015. Mr. Hanneman is a partner of the general partner, as well as a limited partner, of AN Gold Mines and holds an
11.9% net interest in AN Gold Mines.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements. 

Environmental Regulations  

The operations of the Company may in the future be affected
from time to time in varying degrees by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future removal and site restoration
costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The
Company s policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically
proven and economically feasible measures. 

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders  
 
The Company has been a  passive foreign investment company  ( PFIC ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes
in recent years and expects to continue to be a PFIC in the future.  Current and prospective U.S. shareholders should consult
their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of PFIC classification and the U.S. federal tax treatment of PFICs.  Additional
information on this matter is included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
under  Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
of Equity Securities - Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of September 30, 2016, an evaluation was carried out under
the supervision of and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act: (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows for timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. 

The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls
and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system will
be met and is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgement in designing, implementing and evaluating controls
and procedures and the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q,
you should carefully consider the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 under the heading  Risk Factors.  

There is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.    

The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. This assumes continuing
operations and the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As at September 30, 2016,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,759,123 compared to $6,493,486 at December 31, 2015. The Company s estimate
of the amount of the contingent payment due on January 12, 2017 is $14,800,000, which significantly exceeds the Company s
available cash resources. The Company will also require significant additional financing to continue its operations in connection
with advancing activities at the Livengood Gold Project and for the development of any mine that may be determined to be built
at the Livengood Gold Project. In addition, any significant delays in the issuance of required permits for the ongoing work at
the Livengood Gold Project, or unexpected results in connection with the ongoing work, could result in the Company being required
to raise additional funds to advance permitting efforts.  

The Company has no revenue
generating operations from which it can internally generate funds. The Company expects to seek to obtain significant additional
financing on or before January 2017, but there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing
required on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company is able to secure some additional equity financing, the Company may
be unable to raise enough capital to both make the contingent payment and continue its operations in connection with advancing
all activities at the Livengood Gold Project into 2017 and beyond. As a result, we have included a discussion about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.  

In the event that the
Company is unable to secure sufficient additional financing, it may be unable to make the contingent payment when due on January
12, 2017, and the Company may be required to reduce all discretionary activities at the Project to preserve its working capital
to fund anticipated non-discretionary expenditures beyond the 2016 fiscal year, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects. In addition, if the Company is unable
to make the contingent payment and the proceeds from the sale of the underlying claims is not sufficient to satisfy the outstanding
amount of the contingent payment, the beneficiaries will have recourse against the Company for any shortfall, which could have
a material adverse impact on the Company and its ability to continue its business.

PROCEEDS  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES  

Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that
are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose
specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirement are based on the safety
and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ) which
is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor s Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ). During the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine
Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
