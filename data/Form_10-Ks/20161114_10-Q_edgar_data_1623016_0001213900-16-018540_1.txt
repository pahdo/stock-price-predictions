NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION  

Nature of Operations and Background    

CannaMED Enterprises, Inc.
( CannaMED  or  the Company ) was incorporated on September 25, 2014 under the laws of the state of Delaware
under the name Redwood Valley Acquisition Corporation ( Redwood Valley  ) to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking,
including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company was formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic
private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 The Company s objectives were to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company
with Redwood Valley. This combination would normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.
In most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

During the period covered
by this report, the Company located such a target and began the process to effect a change in control. On August 24, 2015, the
following events occurred which resulted in a change of control of the Company: 

1.  
      The officers and directors of Redwood Valley, James Cassidy and James McKillop, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) pursuant to which they entered into an agreement to sell an aggregate of 19,500,000 shares of their shares of the Company s common stock to Mikhail Artamonov, at an aggregate purchase price of $75,000. These shares represented 98% of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. Effective upon the closing date of the Share Purchase Agreement, James Cassidy and James McKillop executed the agreement and owned 7% of shares of the Company s stock, respectively, and Mikhail Artamonov, was the majority stockholder of the Company.   

2.  
      The Company redeemed and cancelled an aggregate of 19,500,000 of the then 20,000,000 shares of outstanding stock at a redemption price of $.0001 per share and cancelled such shares. The then current officers and directors resigned.   

3.  
      Mikhail Artamonov was named President, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.  He now serves as the Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company.   

On August 25, 2015, the
Company issued 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at par representing 86% of the total outstanding 3,500,000 shares of common
stock to Mikhail Artamonov, the sole officer and director of the Company. The company effected a change of control and changed
its name to CannaMED Enterprises, Inc.  With this change of direction, the Company intends to consult with or effect a business
combination with a private company to develop as medical cannabis industry innovators, utilizing the Company's team of healthcare
and business professionals to start and/or source, research, evaluate and purchase products and companies.  The Company will
strive to develop environmentally friendly and economically sustainable business within the swiftly developing medical cannabis
industry. 

The Company envisions to initially enter into joint ventures or acquire
partial ownership in: 

a laboratory for medical cannabis testing, a pharmacy to perform research;   

a pharmacy to perform research and development of the newest medical cannabis formulations;   

a clinical practice to establish the network dispensaries;   

a packaging company;   

a research facility; and   

real estate to establish the foundation for the growing network

Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates    

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Income Taxes    

CannaMED accounts for income
taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ), which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities
and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely
than not to be realized. 

ASC 740 provides guidance
on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements. ASC 740 requires a company
to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical
merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the
amount to recognize in the financial statements. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents    

Cash and cash equivalents
includes all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as of September 30, 2016. The Company
did not have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Concentration of Risk   

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with
high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
limit as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Revenue Recognition    

The Company will recognize
revenue in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can
be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery of product has met the criteria established in the
arrangement or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. This occurs
when the products or services are completed in accordance with the contracts we have with clients. In connection with our products
and services arrangements, if we are paid in advance, these amounts will be classified as deferred revenue and amortized over the
term of the agreement. 

Net Loss Per Share    

Basic net loss per
share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the loss applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued, using the treasury stock method. Due to
the Company s losses in the periods presented, the Company currently has no dilutive securities and as such, basic and
diluted loss per share are the same for such periods.

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

CannaMED has not yet generated
any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating loss. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital
deficit of $6,557 and an accumulated deficit of $28,287. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its
ability to generate sufficient cash flows from a business combination or other operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining
additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as may be required. 

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In order to maintain its
current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations, loans from
officers, or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase
of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its
current level of operations. 

NOTE 3   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In March 2016, the FASB issued
an amendment to the guidance on stock compensation. The amendment simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements, but anticipates that adoption of this guidance will reduce its effective tax rate. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued
an update to the guidance on revenue recognition. The update clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations,
including how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply
the control principle to certain types of arrangements. In April 2016, the FASB issued another update to the guidance on revenue
recognition. This update clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing, while retaining
the related principles for those areas. The amendments in these updates are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the revenue
recognition guidance, including these updates, will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB
issued an amendment to the guidance on leases. The amendment improves transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing
lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

There are no other recently issued accounting
pronouncements that the Company has yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on its financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.

NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY PAYABLE

Total related party
payables were $5,427 and $0, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Related party payables consists of
bills paid by the Company s Chief Executive Officer on behalf of the Company. This liability does not accrue interest and
is payable on demand.  

NOTE 5   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT

Preferred Stock -  
The Company is authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. There were no preferred
shares issued as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Common Stock -  
Common stock consists of $0.0001 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized, of which 3,500,000 were issued and outstanding as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The current ownership structure is as follows: 

NOTE 6   INCOME TAX  

The
Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability
to generate taxable income in future periods. The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established
against deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely
than not. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization
of such amounts to be more likely than not.

Nature of Operations and Background     

CannaMED Enterprises, Inc.
( CannaMED  or  the Company ) was incorporated on September 25, 2014 under the laws of the state of Delaware
under the name Redwood Valley Acquisition Corporation ( Redwood Valley  ) to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking,
including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company was formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic

During the period covered
by this report, the Company located such a target and began the process to effect a change in control. On August 24, 2015, the
following events occurred which resulted in a change of control of the Company: 

1.

3.  
      Mikhail Artamonov was named President, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.  He now serves as the Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company.   

8  

On August 25, 2015, the
Company issued 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at par representing 86% of the total outstanding 3,500,000 shares of common
stock to Mikhail Artamonov, the sole officer and director of the Company. The company effected a change of control and changed

No assurances can be given
that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. 

As of September 30, 2016,

have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company
has no operations and the continuation as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, its ability
to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company. 

Until such time as the Company
effects a change in control or business combination, management will advance all the expenses of the Company in the form of contributed
capital. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no outstanding off-balance
sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving
non-exchange traded contracts.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions,
estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and
contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial
statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management s subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive
because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate
may differ significantly from management s current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in
the preparation of our financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue
in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery of product has met the criteria established in the arrangement or
services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. This occurs when the products
or services are completed in accordance with the contracts we have with clients. In connection with our products and services arrangements,
when we are paid in advance, these amounts are classified as deferred revenue and amortized over the term of the agreement. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There are no recently issued
accounting pronouncements that the Company has yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on its financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are applicable
under the circumstances. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

As a  smaller reporting
company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this
Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures :  We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures , as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of
a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2016, that our
disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to a reasonable assurance level of achieving such objectives. However, it should
be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions,
regardless of how remote. 

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting :  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ending September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
