Note
1. The Company    

The
Company and Nature of Business   

eWellness
Healthcare Corporation (f/k/a Dignyte, Inc.), (the  Company ,  we ,  us ,  our )
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 7, 2011, to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited
to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has generated no revenues to date. Prior to the Share Exchange Agreement discussed
below, other than issuing shares to its original shareholder, the Company never commenced any operational activities.  

The
eWellness strategy as a first-to-market enterprise in the Physical Therapy based telemedicine industry is to deliver a telemedicine
physical therapy service augmenting corporate wellness programs and also expand nationally through a Software as a Service (SaaS)
business model that enables existing physical therapy practices to extend their offerings via our telemedicine solution. Our objective
is to provide Distance Monitored Physical Therapy (PHZIO) Programs to pre diabetic, cardiac and health challenged patients and
knee and hip surgery rehabilitation. For corporate wellness program our services are designed to deliver significant healthcare
savings to the company while charging a very small relative incremental cost.  

Note
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
interim financial information of the Company as of periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 is unaudited. The balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015 is derived from audited financial statements of eWellness Healthcare Corporation. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
statements. Accordingly, they omit or condense footnotes and certain other information normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The accounting policies followed for quarterly financial
reporting conform to the accounting policies disclosed in ASU 2014-10. In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the interim periods reported have been made. All such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that can be expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2016. The unaudited financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
materially from these good faith estimates and judgments.  

Going
Concern   

For the period ended September
30, 2016, the Company has no revenues. The Company has an accumulated loss of $6,580,028. In view of these matters, there is substantive
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue operations is
dependent upon the Company s ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable
operations, of which there can be no guarantee. The Company intends to finance its future development activities and its working
capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing
sources.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had the following assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  

As of December 31, 2015,
the Company had the following assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Loss
per Common Share   

The
Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the loss per share. Basic loss per common share calculations are determined by dividing
net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share
calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents
outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.
As the Company has incurred losses for the period ended September 30, 2016, no dilutive shares are added into the loss per share
calculation. While currently anti-dilutive, the following instruments could potentially dilute EPS in the future resulting in
the following common stock equivalents:  

Note
3. Related Party Transactions   

Through
the period ended September 30, 2016, a related party, a company for which the Company s former Secretary-Treasurer and CFO

During
2014, the Company entered into a license agreement with a programming company in which one of our directors is Chief Marketing
Officer. Through the licensing agreement, we obtained a perpetual license to use the programming code created by a video management

Asset and Accounts Payable on the Balance Sheet.

2015. The previously granted warrants had a purchase price of $.35 per share or $.50 per share and the Company has agreed to reduce
both prices to $.045 per share. Amendments for these warrants were issued. 

The
following is a summary of the status of all of the Company s warrants as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the nine
months ended on that date:  

For
purpose of determining the fair market value of the warrants and options issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we used the Black Scholes option valuation model. These valuations were done throughout the period at the date of issuance and
not necessarily as of the reporting date. The significant assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation of the date of issuance
are as follows:

Note
7. Commitments, Contingencies    

The
Company may be subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings, regulatory reviews or investigations associated with its business
and other matters arising in the normal conduct of its business. The following is a description of an uncertainty that is considered
other than ordinary, routine and incidental to the business.  

The
closing of the Initial Exchange Agreement with Private Co. was conditioned upon certain, limited customary representations and
warranties, as well as, among other things, our compliance with Rule 419 ( Rule 419 ) of Regulation C under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and the consent of our shareholders as required under Rule 419. Accordingly,
we conducted a  Blank Check  offering subject to Rule 419 (the  Rule 419 Offering ) and filed a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 to register the shares of such offering; the Registration Statement was declared effective on September
14, 2012. We used 10% of the subscription proceeds as permitted under Rule 419 and the amount remaining in the escrow trust as
of the date of the closing of the Share Exchange was $90,000 (the  Trust Account Balance ).  

Rule
419 required that the Share Exchange occur on or before March 18, 2014, but due to normal negotiations regarding the transactions
and the parties  efforts to satisfy all of the closing conditions, the Share Exchange did not close on such date. Accordingly,
after numerous discussions with management of both parties, they entered into an Amended and Restated Share Exchange Agreement
(the  Share Exchange Agreement ) to reflect a revised business combination structure, pursuant to which we would:
(i) file a registration statement on Form 8-A ( Form 8A ) to register our common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of
the Exchange Act, which we did on May 1, 2014 and (ii) seek to convert the participants of the Rule 419 Offering into participants
of a similarly termed private offering (the  Converted Offering ), to be conducted pursuant to Regulation D, as promulgated
under the Securities Act.  

Fifty-two
persons participated in the Rule 419 Offering and each of them gave the Company his/her/its consent to use his/her/its escrowed
funds to purchase shares of the Company s restricted common stock in the Converted Offering (the  Consent )
rather than have their funds returned. To avoid further administrative work for the investors, we believe that we took reasonable
steps to inform investors of the situation and provided them with an appropriate opportunity to maintain their investment in the
Company, if they so choose, or have their funds physically returned. Management believed the steps it took constituted a constructive
return of the funds and therefore met the requirements of Rule 419.  

However,
pursuant to Rule 419(e)(2)(iv),   funds held in the escrow or trust account shall be
returned by first class mail or equally prompt means to the purchaser within five business days [ if the related acquisition
transaction does not occur by a date that is 18 months after the effective date of the related registration statement]. 
As set forth above, rather than physically return the funds, we sought consent from the investors of the Rule 419 Offering to
direct their escrowed funds to the Company to instead purchase shares in the Converted Offering. The consent document (which was
essentially a form of rescission) was given to the investors along with a private placement memorandum describing the Converted
Offering and stated that any investor who elected not to participate in the Converted Offering would get 90% of their funds physically
returned. Pursuant to Rule 419(b)(2)(vi), a blank check company is entitled to use 10% of the proceed/escrowed funds; therefore,
if a return of funds is required, only 90% of the proceed/escrowed funds need be returned. The Company received $100,000 proceeds
and used $10,000 as per Rule 419(b)(2)(vi); therefore, only $90,000 was subject to possible return.  

As
disclosed therein, we filed the amendments to the initial Form 8-K in response to comments from the SEC regarding the Form 8-K
and many of those comments pertain to an alleged violation of Rule 419. The Company continued to provide the SEC with information
and analysis as to why it believes it did not violate Rule 419, but was unable to satisfy the SEC s concerns. Comments and
communications indicate that Rule 419 requires a physical return of funds if a 419 offering cannot be completed because a business
combination was not consummated within the required time frame; constructive return is not permitted.

As
a result of these communications and past comments, we are disclosing that we did not comply with the requirements of Rule 419,
which required us to physically return the funds previously submitted to escrow pursuant to the Rule 419 Offering. As a result
of our failure to comply with Rule 419, the SEC may bring an enforcement action or commence litigation against us for failure
to   strictly comply with Rule 419 .
If any claims or actions were to be brought against us relating to our lack of compliance with Rule 419, we could be subject to
penalties (including criminal penalties), required to pay fines, make damages payments or settlement payments. In addition, any
claims or actions could force us to expend significant financial resources to defend ourselves, could divert the attention of
our management from our core business and could harm our reputation.   

Ultimately,
the SEC determined to terminate its review of the Initial Form 8-K and related amendments, rather than provide us with additional
opportunities to address their concerns and therefore, we did not clear their comments. It is not possible at this time to predict
whether or when the SEC may initiate any proceedings, when this issue may be resolved or what, if any, penalties or other remedies
may be imposed, and whether any such penalties or remedies would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. Litigation and enforcement actions are inherently unpredictable, the outcome of
any potential lawsuit or action is subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining at this time the likelihood
of a loss, any SEC enforcement action and/or the measurement of the amount of any loss is complex. Consequently, we are unable
to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss. Our assessment is based on an estimate and assumption that has been deemed
reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies heavily on an estimate and assumption that may prove to be incomplete
or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change that estimate and assumption.
 In light of the uncertainty of this issue and while Management evaluates the best and most
appropriate way to resolve same, management determined to create a reserve on the Company s Balance Sheet for the $90,000
that was subject to the Consent.   

The
Company rents its Culver City, CA office space from a company owned by our CEO. The rental agreement provides for the value of
the rent of $500 per month be recorded as contributed towards the founding eWellness and its operations. During the period ended
September 30, 2016, we have recorded this rent payment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Additional Paid in Capital
on the Balance Sheet.  

On
April 1, 2015, the Company entered into an Operating Agreement with Evolution Physical Therapy ( EPT ), a company
owned by one of the Company s officers, wherein it is agreed that EPT would be able to operate the Company s telemedicine
platform  www.phzio.com  and offer it to selected physical therapy patients of EPT. The Company is to receive 75% of the
net insurance reimbursements from the patient for use of the platform. The Company will advance capital requested by EPT for costs
specifically associated with operating the  www.phzio,com  platform and associated physical therapy treatments   computer
equipment, office or facilities rental payments, physical therapist or physical therapy assistant, administrative staff, patient
induction equipment, office supplies, utilities and other associated operating costs. It is anticipated that the operation of
the platform by EPT will generate positive cash flow within 90 days from the start of patient induction.  

On
May 20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Mavericks Capital Securities LLC ( Mavericks ). The term
of the contract begins on the effective date and can be terminated within 30 days upon written notice by either party. The Company
is to pay Mavericks a monthly retainer fee of $10,000 that is deferred until the Company raises $250,000 in new investor funds
from the effective date. In addition, the Company granted Mavericks 250,000 warrants to purchase Company common stock at $.35
per share. On September 28, 2015, the Company and Mavericks entered into an amendment to the consultant agreement pursuant to
which Mavericks will also assist the Company in the acquisition of new customers, for which the Company shall pay Mavericks 10%
of the revenue received by the Company, net of any pass through costs, from any such customers introduced to the Company by Mavericks;
payment shall be made upon the Company s receipt of such revenues. In the amendment, the parties also further clarified
the definition of Customer Acquisition. On October 1, 2016, the engagement with Mavericks was suspended including the accrual
of the monthly fees until the Company s PHZIO platform gains traction with the physical therapy industry. (See Note 12

Note
8. Derivative Valuation   

The warrants granted with
the $275,000 senior convertible promissory note issued on December 7, 2015 have a Most Favored Nation clause resulting in the
exercise price of the warrants not being fixed. Therefore, this feature has been characterized as a derivate liability to be re-measured
at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations. At September 30, 2016,
the outstanding fair value of the warrants accounted for as a derivative liability amounted to $156,760. As of September 30, 2016,
a gain of $200,719 was recognized in the statement of operations as the change in valuation from inception. 

For
purposes of determining the fair market value of the derivative liability for the warrants, the Company used Black Scholes option
valuation model. The significant assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation of the derivative are as follows:  

Note
9. Subsequent Events

note with EAP will be the same as the original note with Firstfire dated December 7, 2015 which are that interest is payable at
8% per annum.  

On
November 14, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor for a note in the principal
amount of $275,000 at a 10% original issue. The note has a provision for 8% interest to be accrued until paid or converted into
shares of common stock.  

On November 14, 2016,
the Company made a partial principal payment of $33,204 on the promissory note dated August 16, 2016 that matured on November
14, 2016 with a remaining balance of $178,628.91. As of November 15, 2016 the Company is in default on this note. Under the default
terms of the note agreement 18% interest shall be payable on the outstanding principal indebtedness together with 18% interest
calculated on the Risky Loan Fee(s) and Default Fee(s) from the date of the original notes, specifically May 30, 2015 until the
note dated August 16, 2016 is paid in full. The Company is currently in discussions with the noteholder regarding an extension
of the due date, but there can be no guarantee as to the outcome of those discussions.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These forward looking statements are
based on our management s current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from expectations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology
such as  may,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes, 
 estimates,   predicts,   potential,   proposed,   intended,  or  continue 
or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully,
because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other  forward-looking 
information. Many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements,
including but not limited to: variability of our future revenues and financial performance; risks associated with product development
and technological changes; the acceptance of our products in the marketplace by potential future customers; general economic conditions.
You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business,
results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities
could decline. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot
guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of
the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.   

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition
reported in the financial statements of eWellness Healthcare Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in this report and the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

THE
COMPANY   

Business
Overview   

Our
business model is to license our PHZIO ( PHZIO ) telemedicine platform to any physical therapy ( PT )
clinic in the U.S. and or have large-scale employers use our PHZIO platform as a fully PT monitored corporate wellness program.  

As
shown in the financial statements accompanying this Quarterly Report, the Company has had no revenues to date and has incurred
only losses since its inception. The Company has operations currently only in Culver City, California and has been issued a  going
concern  opinion from our accountants, based upon the Company s reliance upon the sale of our common stock as the
sole source of funds for our future operations.  

The
Company s operations and corporate offices are located at 11825 Major Street Culver City, CA, 90230, with a telephone number
of (310) 915-9700.  

The
Company s fiscal year end is December 31.  

Plan
of Operations     

The Company s initial
licensee is Evolution Physical Therapy ( EPT ), which is owned by our CEO, Darwin Fogt, MPT. EPT expenses were greater
than treatment revenue generated for the first nine months of 2016 so no payments were made to the Company per the operating agreement.
The Company is in the process of developing marketing channel partnerships with industry association members, existing software-based
telemedicine providers and physical therapy billing and practice management providers. These partnerships, if completed, are anticipated
to begin adding third party PT licensee revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

The
Company s PHZIO home physical therapy exercise platform has been designed to disrupt the $30 billion physical therapy and
the $8 billion corporate wellness industries. PHZIO re-defines the way physical therapy can be delivered. PHZIO is the first real-time
remote monitored 1-to-many physical therapy platform for home use. Due to the real-time patient monitoring feature, the PHZIO
platform is insurance reimbursable by payers such as: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.  

The
PHZIO Solution: A New Physical Therapy Delivery System  

SaaS
    technology platform solution for providers bundling rehabilitation services and employer wellness programs;   

First
    real-time remote monitored 1-to-many physical therapy treatment platform for home use;   

Ability
    for physical therapists to observe multiple patients simultaneously in real-time;   

Solves
    what has been a structural problem and limitation in post-acute care practice growth.   

Based
    on the Company s experience, PT practices can experience 20% higher adherence   compliance rates versus industry
    standards; and   

Based
    on the Company s experience, we have tracked a 30% increase in net income for a PT practice.   

Based
on the Company s experience, patient program adherence in 2015 was nearly 85 percent due to the real-time patient monitoring
and the at-home use of the platform. Now physical therapy practices have a way to scale profitably using a technology platform
that can help them grow beyond the limits of the typical brick and mortar PT clinic.  

Additional
Treatment Protocols: The Company s initial PHZIO application is a 6-month exercise program for patients with back, knee
or hip pain. The next two platforms are anticipated to be released in the fourth quarter of 2016 include a total knee and hip
replacement exercise program. These hip and knee programs have been designed to be integrated into any hospital or medical group s
Medicare CMS bundled payment model for post-acute care physical therapy. These two programs are anticipated to be followed by
woman s health and geriatric programs by the end of the second quarter of 2017.  

Our
PHZIO platform enables employees or patients to engage with live or on-demand video based physical therapy telemedicine treatments
from their home or office. Following a physician s exam and prescription for physical therapy to treat back, knee or hip
pain, a patient can be examined by a physical therapist and, if found appropriate, inducted in the Company s PHZIO program
that includes a progressive 6-month telemedicine exercise program (including monthly in-clinic checkups). All PHZIO treatments
are monitored by a licensed therapist that sees everything the patient is doing while providing their professional guidance and
feedback in real-time. This ensures treatment compliance by the patient, maintains the safety and integrity of the prescribed
exercises, tracks patient metrics and captures pre and post treatment evaluation data. PHZIO unlocks a host of potential for revolutionizing
patient treatment models and directly links back to the established brick and mortar physical therapy clinic. This unique model
enables any physical therapy practice to be able to execute more patient care while utilizing their same resources, and creates
more value than was ever before possible.  

During
2015 and the first nine months of 2016 our PHZIO platform achieved the following metrics:  

The
    total monitored PHZIO patient visits was approximately 1,500.   

The
    average insurance reimbursement per PHZIO session in 2015: $46.87 (excluding co-payments).   

Based
    on the Company s experience, the top line wellness goals of our PHZIO program are to graduate at least 80% of inducted
    patients through our 6-month program. Patients should expect to experience an average of a 20% reduction in BMI, a 4-inch
    reduction in waist size, weight loss of at least 20 pounds, significant overall improvement in balance, coordination, flexibility,
    strength, and lumbopelvic stability. Patients also should score better on Functional Outcomes Scales (Oswestry and LEFS),
    which indicates improved functional activity levels due to reduced low back, knee and hip pain.   

2016
PHZIO Customer Acquisition   Sales Goals    

In
late September, 2016, the Company commercially launched the licensing of our PHZIO platform to 3 rd  party physical therapy
practices throughout the U.S.  

The American Physical
Therapy Association (APTA), Private Practice Section (PPS) members are our initial universe of PT practices to target. Our sale
launch begins with full-page print advertising in the PT industry s premier magazine   Impact   in early September
2016. It is then to be followed up with a full-page ad in the APTA PPS Conference Buyers Guide in early October. Following these
two print advertisements, we were a tier 1 sponsor at the PPS Las Vegas conference from October 19-22, 2016 (October 20 th
 Lunch Sponsor and 4-6pm Cocktail Reception Sponsor   Exclusive PHZIO Demo Session for all attendees). PHZIO will also
have a full-page ad included in November 2016 and January 2017   Impact   magazine issues. Our 2016 Customer Acquisition
  Sales goals are to on-board at least 10 third-party PT practices during the fourth quarter of 2016. Each on-boarded PT practice
will have a goal of inducting at least 3 new patients per week onto our PHZIO platform with a goal of delivering at least 17,000
PHZIO exercise session in the second half of 2016. Based upon achieving this number of PHZIO sessions, it would generate approximately
$344,000 in gross revenue for the Company, during the second half of 2016. Our planned sales launch includes industry advertising,
lead generation and qualification program, which is anticipated to be implemented through a strategic partnership with a US-based
sales support organization through a revenue share agreement. Our customer acquisition and sales strategy includes: 

Lead
Generation and Qualification through a call center that utilizes well-designed program stimuli and tactics, as well as strong
agent lead qualification and closing skills. Next, based upon advertising to the PPS membership, we also plan to include an Inbound
Sales team to handle virtually any type of inbound hard-or soft-sell sales call that embodies a sales performance-based culture.
Our strategic partner will not be a typical script-driven order taking call center, they will embrace the natural dialogue and
relationship skills necessary to turn every contact opportunity into a sale. Lastly, we anticipate an Outbound Sales to the PPS
membership through mail, phone and e-mail, will be handled within the confines of privacy laws and regulations, where we anticipate
creating an effective vehicles for gathering customer information, bringing awareness to discounts or promotions, and serving
as a proactive retention tool for valued customers.  

Customer
Relationship Management (CRM)    

We
will also be implementing a CRM that provides practices, strategies and technologies that we will use to manage and analyze customer
interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle, with the goal of improving business relationships with customers, assisting
in customer retention and driving sales growth. CRM systems are designed to compile information on customers across different
channels   or points of contact between the customer and the company   which could include the company s website,
telephone, live chat, direct mail, marketing materials and social media. CRM systems can also give customer-facing staff detailed
information on customers  personal information, purchase history, buying preferences and concerns.  

Our
PHZIO platform, including: design, testing, exercise intervention, follow-up, and exercise demonstration, has been developed by
accomplished Los Angeles based physical therapist Darwin Fogt. Mr. Fogt has extensive experience and education working with diverse
populations from professional athletes to morbidly obese. He understands the most beneficial exercise prescription to achieve
optimal results and has had great success in motivating all patient types to stay consistent in working toward their goals. Additionally,
his methods have proven effective and safe as he demonstrates exercises with attention to proper form to avoid injury. Mr. Fogt
has established himself as a national leader in his field and has successfully implemented progressive solutions to delivering
physical therapy: he has consulted with and been published by numerous national publications including Runner s World, Men s
Health, Men s Journal, and various Physical Therapy specific magazines; his 13 plus years of experience include rehabilitating
the general population, as well as professional athletes, Olympic gold medalists, and celebrities. He has bridged the gap between
physical therapy and fitness by opening Evolution Fitness, which uses licensed physical therapists to teach high intensity circuit
training fitness classes. He also founded one of the first exclusive prenatal and postnatal physical therapy clinics in the country.
Mr. Fogt is a leader in advancing the profession to incorporate research-based methods and focus on, not only rehabilitation but
also wellness, functional fitness, performance, and prevention. He is able to recognize that the national healthcare structure
(federal and private insurance) is moving toward a model of prevention and that the physical therapy profession will take a larger
role in providing wellness services to patients.  

Innovators
in other industries have solved access, cost and quality inefficiencies through the implementation of technology platforms and
business models that deliver products and services on-demand and create new economies by connecting and empowering both consumers
and businesses. We have taken the same approach to solving the pervasive access, cost and quality challenges facing the current
access to physical therapy clinics.  

Our
underlying technology platform is complex, deeply integrated and purpose-built over the three years for the evolving physical
therapy marketplace. Our PHZIO platform is highly scalable and can support substantial growth of third party licensees. Our PHZIO
platform provides for broad interconnectivity between PT practitioners and their patients and, we believe, uniquely positions
us as a focal point in the rapidly evolving PT industry to introduce innovative, technology-based solutions, such as remote patient
monitoring, post-discharge treatment plan adherence and in-home care.  

We
plan to generate revenue from third-party PT and corporate wellness licensees on a contractually recurring per PHZIO session fee
basis. Our PHZIO platform is anticipated to transform the access, cost and quality dynamics of physical therapy delivery for all
of the market participants. We further believe any patient, employer, health plan or healthcare professional interested in a better
approach to physical therapy is a potential PHZIO platform user.  

We
have developed various key performance indicators that we anticipate using to assess our business after we on-board third party
PT licensees later in the year.  

Before
even launching, we have received a high indication of interest in our service. We think the demand is warranted, but recognize
that in the early stages of our services, we may experience bottlenecks in our ability to meet the demand for same. Under this
type of environment it is critical to maintain awareness of the Company s operational budget goals and how they are being
met in our attempts to address demand. Because the Company is  early stage  and launching with a minimum of capital,
monitoring cash flow on a constant basis will be essential to growth.  

Our
PHZIO platform enables patients to engage with live or on-demand video based physical therapy telemedicine treatments from their
home or office. Following a physician s exam and prescription for physical therapy to treat back, knee or hip pain, a patient
can be examined by a physical therapist and if found appropriate inducted in eWellness  PHZIO program that includes a progressive
6-month telemedicine exercise program (including weekly in-clinic exercise sessions and monthly in-clinic checkups. All PHZIO
treatments are monitored by a licensed therapist that sees everything the patient is doing while providing their professional
guidance and feedback in real-time. This ensures treatment compliance by the patient, maintains the safety and integrity of the
prescribed exercises, tracks patient metrics and captures pre and post treatment evaluation data. PHZIO unlocks a host of potential
for revolutionizing patient treatment models and directly links back to the established brick and mortar Physical Therapy clinic.
This unique model enables any physical therapy practice to be able to execute more patient care while utilizing their same resources,
and creates more value than was ever before possible.  

Through our Cooperative
Operating Agreement with Evolution Physical Therapy ( EPT ) their Marina del Rey, California patient induction office
( PIO ) is effectively a laboratory for us to support the licensing of our platform to the entire Physical Therapy
( PT ) industry. In April we moved the PIO to EPT s Culver City location as we could not extend the lease at
that location. Active PT licensing of our PHZIO platform is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have also developed
a separate vertical for our PHZIO platform that focuses on the marketing of our platform as a robust Corporate Wellness program.
Active marketing to the large scale employers in the Los Angeles area began in the October 2015 with the expectation of beginning
at least pilot program for our Corporate Wellness program during the second quarter of 2016. Results from our current pilot program
are expected to be published during the first quarter of 2017. 

We
are also actively seeking corporate partnership relationships with other telemedicine companies that if completed, would create
a new channel for our corporate wellness PHZIO program. Amid ongoing challenges and changes within the healthcare industry, telemedicine
is emerging as an increasingly attractive tool for delivering quality medical   wellness services.  

In
early 2016, we began offering our PHZIO program that has been designed to be the most productive physical exercise program available
to corporate wellness programs and their employees. We anticipate that employers using our system can significantly improve employee
wellness and decrease costs associated with workman s compensation claims. PHZIO is a comprehensive lifestyle management
intervention. Our PHZIO exercise program documents an employee s success or failure. We can provision highly reliable Return
On Investment ( ROI ) metrics displayed on an easy to use HIPAA compliant dashboard for any organization using our
PHZIO system.  

The
Current State of Workplace Wellness Programs:    

Broadly,
a workplace wellness program is an employment-based activity or employer-sponsored benefit aimed at promoting health-related behaviors
(primary prevention or health promotion) and disease management (secondary prevention). It may include a combination of data collection
on employee health risks and population-based strategies paired with individually focused interventions to reduce those risks.
A formal and universally accepted definition of a workplace wellness program has yet to emerge, and employers define and manage
their programs differently. Programs may be part of a group health plan or be offered outside of that context; they may range
from narrow offerings, such as free gym memberships, to comprehensive counseling and lifestyle management interventions 4 .  

Wellness
programs have become very common, as 92 percent of employers with 200 or more employees reported offering them in 2009. Survey
data indicate that the most frequently targeted behaviors are exercise, addressed by 63 percent of employers with programs; smoking
(60 percent); and weight loss (53 percent). In spite of widespread availability, the actual participation of employees in such
programs remains limited. While no nationally representative data exist, a 2010 non-representative survey suggests that typically
fewer than 20 percent of eligible employees participate in wellness interventions.  

Wellness
Program Impact: In industry surveys, employers typically express their conviction that workplace wellness programs are delivering
on their promise to improve health and reduce costs. Numerous anecdotal accounts of positive program effects are consistent with
this optimistic view. Further, several evaluations of individual programs and summative reviews in the scientific literature provide
corroborating evidence for a positive impact.  

In
 A Review of the U.S. Workplace Wellness Market  , the most recent scientific literature evaluating the impact of
workplace wellness programs on health-related behavior and medical cost outcomes identified 33 peer-reviewed publications that
met their standards for methodological rigor. They found, consistent with previous reviews, evidence for positive effects on diet,
exercise, smoking, alcohol use, physiologic markers, and health care costs, but limited evidence for effects on absenteeism and
mental health. They could not conclusively determine whether or not program intensity was positively correlated with impact. Positive
results found in this and other studies should be interpreted with caution, as many of these programs were not evaluated with
a rigorous approach, and published results may not be representative of the typical experience of a U.S. employer.  

The
Company completed the initial closing of a private financing of up to $120,000 in June, 2016, pursuant to Rule 506 (c) promulgated
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended..  

Results
of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report.  

Operating
Expenses   

Operating
expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,063,810 compared to $363,546, for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $2,389,811 compared to $1,072,480 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses increased for the nine month period primarily as a result of an increase in
professional fees for consulting services.  

Interest
Expense.   

Interest
expense, including interest expense related parties, was $480,324 and $36,826 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015, respectively. Interest expense, including expense-related parties was $1,002,213 and $90,174 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase was related to costs of convertible debt with
unrelated parties.  

Net
Loss   

Net
loss during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $770,809 compared to $429,876 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. Net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totaled $3,123,841 compared to $1,180,835 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the net loss is a result of increased operating and interest expenses as discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
Company had $1,058 and $41,951 cash as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $160,893 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $320,426 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Although the net loss was greater for the period ended September 30, 2016 than that for the period
ended September 30, 2015, the adjustments to reconcile net cash used in operating activities were $1,521,719 and $450,629 for
the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. In addition, the net changes in assets and liabilities
were $1,441, 229 and $409,780 for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4,207 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $120,000 compared to $350,580 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

We
had not yet earned any revenues as of the period ending September 30, 2016. Our current cash position is not sufficient to fund
our cash requirements during the next twelve months including operations and capital expenditures. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

We
had assets at September 30, 2016 of $1,308,860. We will be reliant upon shareholder loans, private placements or public offerings
of equity to fund any kind of operations, although there can be no guarantee we will be able to secure such finding on beneficial
terms, if at all. We have secured no sources of loans.  

Contingencies

The
Company may be subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings, regulatory reviews or investigations associated with its business
and other matters arising in the normal conduct of its business. The following is a description of an uncertainty that is considered
other than ordinary, routine and incidental to the business.  

The
closing of the Initial Exchange Agreement with Private Co. was conditioned upon certain, limited customary representations and
warranties, as well as, among other things, our compliance with Rule 419 ( Rule 419 ) of Regulation C under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and the consent of our shareholders as required under Rule 419. Accordingly,
we conducted a  Blank Check  offering subject to Rule 419 (the  Rule 419 Offering ) and filed a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 to register the shares of such offering; the Registration Statement was declared effective on September
14, 2012. We used 10% of the subscription proceeds as permitted under Rule 419 and the amount remaining in the escrow trust as
of the date of the closing of the Share Exchange was $90,000 (the  Trust Account Balance ).  

Rule
419 required that the Share Exchange occur on or before March 18, 2014, but due to normal negotiations regarding the transactions
and the parties  efforts to satisfy all of the closing conditions, the Share Exchange did not close on such date. Accordingly,
after numerous discussions with management of both parties, they entered into an Amended and Restated Share Exchange Agreement
(the  Share Exchange Agreement ) to reflect a revised business combination structure, pursuant to which we would:
(i) file a registration statement on Form 8-A ( Form 8A ) to register our common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of
the Exchange Act, which we did on May 1, 2014 and (ii) seek to convert the participants of the Rule 419 Offering into participants
of a similarly termed private offering (the  Converted Offering ), to be conducted pursuant to Regulation D, as promulgated
under the Securities Act.  

Fifty-two
persons participated in the Rule 419 Offering and each of them gave the Company his/her/its consent to use his/her/its escrowed
funds to purchase shares of the Company s restricted common stock in the Converted Offering (the  Consent )
rather than have their funds returned. To avoid further administrative work for the investors, we believe that we took reasonable
steps to inform investors of the situation and provided them with an appropriate opportunity to maintain their investment in the
Company, if they so choose, or have their funds physically returned. Management believed the steps it took constituted a constructive
return of the funds and therefore met the requirements of Rule 419.  

However,
pursuant to Rule 419(e)(2)(iv),  funds held in the escrow or trust account shall be returned by first class mail or equally
prompt means to the purchaser within five business days [if the related acquisition transaction does not occur by a date that
is 18 months after the effective date of the related registration statement].  As set forth above, rather than physically
return the funds, we sought consent from the investors of the Rule 419 Offering to direct their escrowed funds to the Company
to instead purchase shares in the Converted Offering. The consent document was given to the investors along with a private placement
memorandum describing the Converted Offering and stated that any investor who elected not to participate in the Converted Offering
would get 90% of their funds physically returned. Pursuant to Rule 419(b)(2)(vi), a blank check company is entitled to use 10%
of the proceed/escrowed funds; therefore, if a return of funds is required, only 90% of the proceed/escrowed funds need be returned.
The Company received $100,000 proceeds and used $10,000 as per Rule 419(b)(2)(vi); therefore, only $90,000 was subject to possible
return.  

As
disclosed in the prior amendments to the Initial Form 8-K, we have filed the prior amendments in response to comments from the
SEC regarding the Form 8-K and many of those comments pertain to the Company s potential violation of Rule 419. Although
the Company has continued to provide the SEC with information and analysis as to why it believes it did not violate Rule 419,
based upon latest communications with the persons reviewing the Form 8-K, they do not agree with the assessments the Company presented
to them. Comments and communications indicate that Rule 419 requires a physical return of funds if a 419 offering cannot be completed
because a business combination was not consummated within the required time frame; constructive return is not permitted.  

As
a result of these communications and past comments, we are disclosing that we did not comply with the requirements of Rule 419,
which required us to physically return the funds previously submitted to escrow pursuant to the Rule 419 Offering. As a result
of our failure to comply with Rule 419, the SEC may bring an enforcement action or commence litigation against us for failure
to strictly comply with Rule 419. If any claims or actions were to be brought against us relating to our lack of compliance with
Rule 419, we could be subject to penalties (including criminal penalties), required to pay fines, make damages payments or settlement
payments. In addition, any claims or actions could force us to expend significant financial resources to defend ourselves, could
divert the attention of our management from our core business and could harm our reputation.  

Ultimately,
the SEC determined to terminate its review of the Initial Form 8-K and related amendments, rather than provide us with additional
opportunities to address their concerns and therefore, we did not clear their comments. It is not possible at this time to predict
whether or when the SEC may initiate any proceedings, when this issue may be resolved or what, if any, penalties or other remedies
may be imposed, and whether any such penalties or remedies would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. Litigation and enforcement actions are inherently unpredictable, the outcome of
any potential lawsuit or action is subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining at this time the likelihood
of a loss, any SEC enforcement action and/or the measurement of the amount of any loss is complex. Consequently, we are unable
to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss. Our assessment is based on an estimate and assumption that has been deemed
reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies heavily on an estimate and assumption that may prove to be incomplete
or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change that estimate and assumption.
In light of the uncertainty of this issue and while Management evaluates the best and most appropriate way to resolve same, management
determined to create a reserve on the Company s Balance Sheet for the $90,000 that was subject to the Consent.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Please
refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for disclosures regarding the Company s critical accounting policies
and estimates, as well as any updates further disclosed in our interim financial statements as described in this Form 10-Q.

As
a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information under Item 3.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

Based
on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules, regulations and forms, and (ii) that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
