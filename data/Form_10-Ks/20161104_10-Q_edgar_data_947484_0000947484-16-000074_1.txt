  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( PSLRA ) provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements. This release or any other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of us may include forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in or incorporated by reference in this release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, for purposes of the PSLRA or otherwise, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   will,   expect,   intend,   estimate,   anticipate,   believe  or  continue  and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature or their negative or variations or similar terminology. 
  Forward-looking statements involve our current assessment of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements are discussed below and elsewhere in this release and in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and include:

    acceptance of our business strategy, security and financial condition by rating agencies and regulators, as well as by brokers and our insureds and reinsureds;  
                
    the integration of United Guaranty and any other businesses we have acquired or may acquire into our existing operations;  
                
    our ability to maintain or improve our ratings, which may be affected by our ability to raise additional equity or debt financings, by ratings agencies  existing or new policies and practices, as well as other factors described herein;  
                
    general economic and market conditions (including inflation, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, prevailing credit terms and the depth and duration of a recession) and conditions specific to the reinsurance and insurance markets (including the length and magnitude of the current  soft  market) in which we operate;  
                
    competition, including increased competition, on the basis of pricing, capacity (including alternative forms of capital), coverage terms or other factors;  
                
    developments in the world s financial and capital markets and our access to such markets; 
                
    our ability to successfully enhance, integrate and maintain operating procedures (including information technology) to effectively support our current and new business;  
                
    the loss of key personnel;  
                
    accuracy of those estimates and judgments utilized in the preparation of our financial statements, including those related to revenue recognition, insurance and other reserves, reinsurance recoverables, investment valuations, intangible assets, bad debts, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and any determination to use the deposit method of accounting, which for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company, like our company, are even more difficult to make than those made in a mature company since relatively limited historical information has been reported to us through   September 30, 2016  ; 
                
    greater than expected loss ratios on business written by us and adverse development on claim and/or claim expense liabilities related to business written by our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries;  
                
    severity and/or frequency of losses; 
                
    claims for natural or man-made catastrophic events in our insurance or reinsurance business could cause large losses and substantial volatility in our results of operations;  
                
    acts of terrorism, political unrest and other hostilities or other unforecasted and unpredictable events;  
                
    availability to us of reinsurance to manage our gross and net exposures and the cost of such reinsurance;  
                
    the failure of reinsurers, managing general agents, third party administrators or others to meet their obligations to us;  
                
    the timing of loss payments being faster or the receipt of reinsurance recoverables being slower than anticipated by us; 
                
    our investment performance, including legislative or regulatory developments that may adversely affect the fair value of our investments; 

Table of Contents  

changes in general economic conditions, including new or continued sovereign debt concerns in Eurozone countries or downgrades of U.S. securities by credit rating agencies, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
                
    the volatility of our shareholders  equity from foreign currency fluctuations, which could increase due to us not matching portions of our projected liabilities in foreign currencies with investments in the same currencies; 
                
    losses relating to aviation business and business produced by a certain managing underwriting agency for which we may be liable to the purchaser of our prior reinsurance business or to others in connection with the May 5, 2000 asset sale described in our periodic reports filed with the SEC; 
                
    changes in accounting principles or policies or in our application of such accounting principles or policies;  
                
    changes in the political environment of certain countries in which we operate or underwrite business; 
                
    statutory or regulatory developments, including as to tax policy and matters and insurance and other regulatory matters such as the adoption of proposed legislation that would affect Bermuda-headquartered companies and/or Bermuda-based insurers or reinsurers and/or changes in regulations or tax laws applicable to us, our subsidiaries, brokers or customers; and 
                
    the other matters set forth under Item 1A  Risk Factors , Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the other factors set forth in our other documents on file with the SEC, and management s response to any of the aforementioned factors.

ITEM 1.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Table of Contents  

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
  Arch Capital Group Ltd.: 
    
  We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arch Capital Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   September 30, 2016  , and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30,     2015  , and the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders  equity and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30,     2015  . These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
    
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
    
  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,   2015  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders  equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 26, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31,   2015  , is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1  .    General 
  
  Arch Capital Group Ltd. ( ACGL ) is a Bermuda public limited liability company which provides insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. As used herein, the  Company  means ACGL and its subsidiaries. The Company s consolidated financial statements include the results of Watford Holdings Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. See Note   3  . 
  The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normally recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of results on an interim basis. The results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year or any future periods. 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted; however, management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   ( 2015 Form 10-K ), including the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
  The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior year information to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on the Company s net income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity or cash flows. Tabular amounts are in U.S. Dollars in thousands, except share amounts, unless otherwise noted. 
   
  2  .    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted 
  The Company adopted a new accounting standard in the 2016 first quarter that provided targeted improvements to consolidation guidance for limited partnerships and other similarly structured entities. The adoption of this standard resulted in the Company concluding that it no longer had a  

variable interest in Alternative Re Ltd.   and, as a result, no longer is required to consolidate Alternative Re Ltd. in its financial statements. Alternative Re Ltd. is a Bermuda-domiciled company that provides collateralized segregated accounts to its clients. The Company applied this new standard on a modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2016. Such adoption did not impact the Company s shareholders  equity or net income. 
  The adoption of the new standard also resulted in a review of certain funds within the Company s investment portfolio  where the Company has a limited partnership interest. See Note     6     for disclosures on limited partnership interests.    
  The Company also adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to hybrid instruments. The new guidance clarified the evaluation of whether the nature of a host contract within a hybrid instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity. The Company has adopted this new guidance on a modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2016. Based on a review of hybrid instruments issued in the form of a share (both held in its investment portfolio and issued as part of capital raising), the Company determined the new accounting guidance had no impact on the classification or accounting for its existing hybrid instruments.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
  An accounting standard was issued in the 2015 second quarter requiring new disclosures about the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses for short-duration insurance contracts. These disclosures will provide additional insight into an insurance entity s ability to underwrite and anticipate costs associated with claims. This accounting guidance is effective for the 2016 annual reporting period and interim periods thereafter and should be applied retrospectively. The Company is assessing the impact the implementation of this standard will have on the disclosures included in its consolidated financial statements. 
  An accounting standard was issued in the 2016 first quarter to improve and simplify the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. The new standard provides simplifications with respect to income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows for these types of transactions. The standard is effective in the 2017 first quarter and early adoption is permitted. The application of the new standard is dependent on the specific area that is amended. The Company is assessing the impact the implementation of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  New accounting guidance was issued in the 2016 first quarter pertaining to the accounting for leases by a lessee. The new accounting guidance requires that the lessee recognize an  

Table of Contents  
  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

asset and a liability for leases with a lease term greater than 12 months regardless of whether the lease is classified as operating or financing. Under current accounting, operating leases are not reflected in the balance sheet. This accounting guidance is effective for the 2019 first quarter, though early application is permitted, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The Company is assessing the impact the implementation of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  An accounting standard was issued in the 2016 second quarter that changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income. The standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime  expected credit loss  and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This accounting guidance is effective for the 2020 first quarter, though early application is permitted in the 2019 first quarter, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis for the majority of the provisions. The Company is assessing the impact the implementation of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  An accounting standard was issued in the 2016 third quarter addressing several clarifications on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. Among several other cash flow issues, the new guidance specifically addresses the classification of debt prepayment or debt issuance costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investees. The new guidance also provides a broader principle on identifying the type of activity of the cash flow item by focusing on the cash flow item s nature and the predominant source or use of that item. This accounting guidance is effective in the 2018 first quarter and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the impact the implementation of this standard will have on the classification and presentation of its statement of cash flows. 
   
           3  . 
    Variable Interest Entities and Noncontrolling Interests 
     
  A variable interest entity ( VIE ) refers to an entity that has characteristics such as (i) insufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or (ii) instances where the equity investors, as a group, do not have characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is defined as the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest as a result of having both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from  

the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If a company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, it is required to consolidate the VIE in its financial statements. 
  Watford Holdings Ltd. 
  In March 2014, the Company invested   $100.0 million   and acquired approximately   11%   of Watford Holdings Ltd. s common equity and a warrant to purchase additional common equity. Watford Holdings Ltd. is the parent of Watford Re Ltd., a multi-line Bermuda reinsurance company (together with Watford Holdings Ltd.,  Watford Re ). Watford Re is considered a VIE and the Company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of Watford Re. As such, the results of Watford Re are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  The Company does not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford Re, and the Company s financial exposure to Watford Re is limited to its investment in Watford Re s common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from reinsurance transactions. 
  The following table provides the carrying amount and balance sheet caption in which the assets and liabilities of Watford Re are reported: 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Watford Re generated   $207.0 million   of cash   provided by   operating activities,   $124.0 million   of cash   used for   investing activities and   $119.6 million   of cash   used for   financing activities,  

Table of Contents  
  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

compared to   $204.3 million   of cash   provided by   operating activities,    $354.5 million   of cash   used for   investing activities  and    $268.3 million   of cash   provided by   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Non-redeemable noncontrolling interests 
  The Company accounts for the portion of Watford Re s common equity attributable to third party investors in the shareholders  equity section of its consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership in Watford Re s common shares was approximately   89%   at   September 30, 2016  . The portion of Watford Re s income or loss attributable to third party investors is recorded in the consolidated statements of income in  net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.   
  The following table sets forth activity in the non-redeemable noncontrolling interests: 

Redeemable noncontrolling interests 
  The Company accounts for redeemable noncontrolling interests in the mezzanine section of its consolidated balance sheets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Such redeemable noncontrolling interests relate to the   9,065,200   cumulative redeemable preference shares ( Watford Preference Shares ) issued in March 2014 with a  

par value of   $0.01   per share and a liquidation preference of   $25.00   per share. Preferred dividends, including the accretion of the discount and issuance costs, are included in  net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  in the Company s consolidated statements of income.  
  The following table sets forth activity in the redeemable non-controlling interests: 

The portion of Watford Re s income or loss attributable to third party investors, recorded in the Company s consolidated statements of income in  net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests,  are summarized in the table below:

4  .    Earnings Per Common Share 
  
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: 

(1) 
    Certain stock options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share where the exercise price of the stock options exceeded the average market price and would have been anti-dilutive or where, when applying the treasury stock method to in-the-money options, the sum of the proceeds, including unrecognized compensation, exceeded the average market price and would have been anti-dilutive. For the   2016 third quarter   and   2015 third quarter  , the number of stock options excluded were   334,203   and   390,406  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the number of stock options excluded were   842,105   and   957,838  , respectively.  

Table of Contents  
  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

5  .    Segment Information 
  
  The Company classifies its businesses into   three   underwriting segments   insurance, reinsurance and mortgage   and   two   other operating segments    other  and corporate (non-underwriting). The Company determined its reportable segments using the management approach described in accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. Intersegment business is allocated to the segment accountable for the underwriting results. 
  The Company s insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments each have managers who are responsible for the overall profitability of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to the Company s chief operating decision makers, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer of ACGL. The chief operating decision makers do not assess performance, measure return on equity or make resource allocation decisions on a line of business basis. Management measures segment performance for its three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. The Company does not manage its assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and, accordingly, investment income is not allocated to each underwriting segment. 
  The insurance segment consists of the Company s insurance underwriting units which offer specialty product lines on a worldwide basis. Product lines include: construction and national accounts; excess and surplus casualty; lenders products; professional lines; programs; property, energy, marine and aviation; travel, accident and health; and other (consisting of alternative markets, excess workers' compensation and surety business).

    In securities lending transactions, the Company receives collateral in excess of the fair value of the securities pledged. For purposes of this table, the Company has excluded the collateral received under securities lending, at fair value and included the securities pledged under securities lending, at fair value. See   Securities Lending Agreements.  
       
  Securities Lending Agreements 
  The Company enters into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income whereby it loans certain of its securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms, for short periods of time through a lending agent. The Company maintains legal control over the securities it lends, retains the earnings and cash flows associated with the loaned securities and receives a fee from the borrower for the temporary use of the securities. An indemnification agreement with the lending agent protects the Company in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return any of the securities on loan  by the Company. 
  The Company receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral primarily consists of short-term investments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the cash collateral received on securities lending was   $85.1 million   and the fair value of security collateral received was   $380.9 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the cash collateral received on securities lending was   $52.7 million  , which included   $3.0 million   that was reinvested in sub-prime mortgage backed securities, and the fair value of security collateral received was   $336.7 million  .  
  The Company s securities lending transactions were accounted for as secured borrowings with significant investment categories as follows:

Other Investments 
  The following table summarizes the Company s other investments, including available for sale and fair value option components: 

(1) 
    Includes fund investments with strategies in mortgage servicing rights, transportation, infrastructure and other. 
       
  Certain of the Company s other investments are in investment funds for which the Company has the option to redeem at agreed upon values as described in each investment fund s subscription agreement. Depending on the terms of the various subscription agreements, investments in investment funds may be redeemed daily, monthly, quarterly or on other terms. Two common redemption restrictions which may impact the Company s ability to redeem these investment funds are gates and lockups. A gate is a suspension of redemptions which may be implemented by the general partner or investment manager of the fund in order to defer, in whole or in part, the redemption request in the event the aggregate amount of redemption requests exceeds a predetermined percentage of the investment fund s net assets which may otherwise hinder the general partner or investment manager s ability to liquidate holdings in an orderly fashion in order to generate the cash necessary to fund extraordinarily large redemption payouts. A lockup period is the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to hold the security before having the ability to redeem. If the investment funds are eligible to be redeemed, the time to redeem such fund can take weeks or months following the notification. 

Fair Value Option    
  The following table summarizes the Company s assets and liabilities which are accounted for using the fair value option: 

Limited partnership interests 
  In the normal course of its activities, the Company invests in limited partnerships as part of its overall investment strategy. Such amounts are included in  investments accounted for using the equity method  and  investments accounted for using the fair value option.  Based on the new accounting guidance for consolidation, the Company determined that these     limited partnership interests represented variable interests in the funds because the     general partner did not have a significant interest in the fund. The Company has determined that it is not required to consolidate these investments because it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds. The   Company s maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheet and any unfunded     commitment. 
  The following table summarizes investments in limited partnership interests where the Company has a variable interest by balance sheet line item:

Net Investment Income 
  The components of net investment income were derived from the following sources:   

           (1) 
    Includes income distributions from investment funds and other items.  
     Net Realized Gains (Losses) 
  Net realized gains (losses) were as follows, excluding other than-temporary impairment provision.   

           (1) 
    See Note   8   for information on the Company s derivative instruments. 
              (2) 
    Includes the re-measurement of contingent consideration liability amounts. 

Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Investment Funds Accounted for Using the Equity Method 
  The Company recorded   $16.7 million   of equity in net income related to investment funds accounted for using the equity method in the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $2.1 million   of loss for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $32.1 million   of equity in net income related to investment funds accounted for using the equity method for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $19.9 million   of equity in net income for the   2015   period. In applying the equity method, investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on the Company s proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the market value of the underlying securities in the funds). Such investments are generally recorded on a one to three month lag based on the availability of reports from the investment funds. 
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
  The Company performs quarterly reviews of its available for sale investments in order to determine whether declines in fair value below the amortized cost basis were considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance.  
  The following table details the net impairment losses recognized in earnings by asset class: 

Table of Contents  
  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

A description of the methodology and significant inputs used to measure the amount of net impairment losses recognized in earnings in the 2016 periods is as follows: 
             
    Corporate bonds   the Company reviewed the business prospects, credit ratings, estimated loss given default factors, foreign currency impacts and information received from asset managers and rating agencies for certain corporate bonds. Impairment losses primarily resulted from reductions on non-investment grade corporate bonds in the energy sector, reflecting current market conditions; 

Equity securities   the Company utilized information received from asset managers on common stocks, including the business prospects, recent events, industry and market data and other factors. Impairment losses were primarily on equities which were in an unrealized loss position for a significant length of time; 

Asset backed securities   the Company utilized underlying data provided by asset managers, cash flow projections and additional information from credit agencies in order to determine an expected recovery value for each security. Impairment losses primarily reflected a reduction on one security following an analysis of expected cash flows. 

Other investments   the Company utilized information received from asset managers on investment funds, including the business prospects, recent events, industry and market data and other factors. Impairment losses reflected a reduction on certain funds which were in an unrealized loss position for a significant length of time; 

Mortgage backed securities   the Company utilized underlying data provided by asset managers, cash flow projections and additional information from credit agencies in order to determine an expected recovery value for each security. The analysis includes a review of cash flow projections under base case and stress case scenarios which modify the expected default expectations and loss severities and slow down prepayment assumptions. The significant inputs in the models include the expected default rates, delinquency rates and foreclosure costs. Impairment losses resulted from relatively small adjustments on a number of mortgage backed securities; 

Non-U.S. government securities   impairment losses related to foreign currency impacts on securities which were in an unrealized loss position for a significant length of time. 

The Company believes that the   $5.7 million   of OTTI included in accumulated other comprehensive income at   September 30, 2016   on the securities which were considered by the Company to be impaired was due to market and sector-related factors (  i.e.  , not credit losses). At   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not intend to sell these securities, or any other securities which were in an unrealized loss position, and determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their cost basis. 
  The following table provides a roll forward of the amount related to credit losses recognized in earnings for which a portion of an OTTI was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income: 

Restricted Assets 
  The Company is required to maintain assets on deposit, which primarily consist of fixed maturities, with various regulatory authorities to support its insurance and reinsurance operations. The Company s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain assets in trust accounts as collateral for insurance and reinsurance transactions with affiliated companies and also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties. See Note   9   for further details.

7  .    Fair Value 
  
  Accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP and provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP. It defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for the disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The level in the hierarchy within which a given fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement (Level 1 being the highest priority and Level 3 being the lowest priority). 
  The levels in the hierarchy are defined as follows: 
           Level 1: 
    Inputs to the valuation methodology are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for   identical   assets or liabilities in   active markets 
              Level 2: 
    Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
              Level 3: 
    Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
     Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for securities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such securities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. The Company reviews its securities measured at fair value and discusses the proper classification of such investments with investment advisers and others. 

The Company determines the existence of an active market based on its judgment as to whether transactions for the financial instrument occur in such market with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information. The independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets. The Company uses quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining fair values of its fixed maturity investments. To validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources, the Company's review process includes, but is not limited to: (i) quantitative analysis (e.g., comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark, with significant differences identified and investigated); (ii) a review of the average number of prices obtained in the pricing process and the range of resulting fair values; (iii) initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value; (iv) a comparison of the fair value estimates to the Company s knowledge of the current market; (v) a comparison of the pricing services' fair values to other pricing services' fair values for the same investments; and (vi) periodic back-testing, which includes randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing the executed prices to the fair value estimates from the pricing service. A price source hierarchy was maintained in order to determine which price source would be used (i.e., a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases). The hierarchy prioritizes pricing services based on availability and reliability and assigns the highest priority to index providers. Based on the above review, the Company will challenge any prices for a security or portfolio which are considered not to be representative of fair value. The Company did not adjust any of the prices obtained from the independent pricing sources at   September 30, 2016  . 
  In certain circumstances, when fair values are unavailable from these independent pricing sources, quotes are obtained directly from broker-dealers who are active in the corresponding markets. Such quotes are subject to the validation procedures noted above. Of the   $16.94 billion   of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $511.6 million  , or   3.1%  , were priced using non-binding broker-dealer quotes. Of the   $15.40 billion   of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $317.8 million  , or   2.1%  , were priced using non-binding broker-dealer quotes. 
  Fixed maturities 
  The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to estimate the fair value of its fixed maturity securities, when possible. The market approach includes obtaining prices from independent pricing services, such as index providers and pricing vendors, as well as to a lesser extent quotes from  

Table of Contents  
  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

broker-dealers. The independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Each source has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded. In general, these methods involve the use of  matrix pricing  in which the independent pricing source uses observable market inputs including, but not limited to, investment yields, credit risks and spreads, benchmarking of like securities, broker-dealer quotes, reported trades and sector groupings to determine a reasonable fair value. 
  The following describes the significant inputs generally used to determine the fair value of the Company s fixed maturity securities by asset class: 
             
    U.S. government and government agencies   valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The Company determined that all U.S. Treasuries would be classified as Level 1 securities due to observed levels of trading activity, the high number of strongly correlated pricing quotes received on U.S. Treasuries and other factors. The fair values of U.S. government agency securities are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are observable market inputs, the fair values of U.S. government agency securities are classified within Level 2. 
                
    Corporate bonds   valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for corporate bonds are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. One security is included in Level 3 due to a low level of transparency on the inputs used in the pricing process. 
                
    Mortgage-backed securities   valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all  through pricing vendors and index providers with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models (including Option Adjusted Spread) which use spreads to determine the expected average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. The pricing services also review prepayment speeds and other indicators, when  

applicable. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for mortgage-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. 
             
    Municipal bonds   valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The fair values of these securities are generally determined using spreads obtained from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market, trade prices and the new issue market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for municipal bonds are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. 
                
    Commercial mortgage-backed securities   valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models which use spreads to determine the appropriate average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. The pricing services also review prepayment speeds and other indicators, when applicable. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for commercial mortgage-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. 
                
    Non-U.S. government securities   valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The fair values of these securities are generally based on international indices or valuation models which include daily observed yield curves, cross-currency basis index spreads and country credit spreads. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for non-U.S. government securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. 
                
    Asset-backed securities   valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models (including Option Adjusted Spread) which use spreads to determine the appropriate average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. The pricing services also review prepayment speeds and other indicators, when applicable. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for asset-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are  

Table of Contents  
  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

classified within Level 2. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to a low level of transparency on the inputs used in the pricing process. 
  Equity securities 
  The Company determined that exchange-traded equity securities would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Other equity securities are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
  Other investments 
  The Company determined that exchange-traded investments in mutual funds would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Other investments also include term loan investments for which fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of term loan investments with similar characteristics, pricing models or matrix pricing. Such investments are generally classified within Level 2. The fair values for certain of the Company s other investments are determined using net asset values as advised by external fund managers. The net asset value is based on the fund manager s valuation of the underlying holdings in accordance with the fund s governing documents. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Derivative instruments 
  The Company s futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and other derivatives trade in  

the over-the-counter derivative market. The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to estimate the fair value for these derivatives based on significant observable market inputs from third party pricing vendors, non-binding broker-dealer quotes and/or recent trading activity. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for these derivative instruments are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.  
  Short-term investments 
  The Company determined that certain of its short-term investments held in highly liquid money market-type funds, Treasury bills and commercial paper would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair values of other short-term investments are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve and are classified within Level 2. 
  Contingent consideration liabilities 
  Contingent consideration liabilities (included in  other liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets) include amounts related to the acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance Company and its affiliated mortgage insurance companies and other acquisitions. Such amounts are remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recognized in  net realized gains (losses).  To determine the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, the Company estimates future payments using an income approach based on modeled inputs which include a weighted average cost of capital. The Company determined that contingent consideration liabilities would be included within Level 3.

Financial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, At Fair Value 
  The Company uses various financial instruments in the normal course of its business. The carrying values of cash, accrued investment income, receivable for securities sold, certain other assets, payable for securities purchased and certain other liabilities approximated their fair values at   September 30, 2016  , due to their respective short maturities. As these financial instruments are not actively traded, their respective fair values are classified within Level 2. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the senior notes of ACGL were carried at their cost, net of debt issuance costs, of   $296.9 million   and had a fair value of   $407.3 million   while the senior notes of Arch Capital Group (U.S.) Inc. ( Arch-U.S. ) were carried at their cost, net of debt issuance costs, of   $494.5 million   and had a fair value of   $552.4 million  . The fair values of the senior notes were obtained from a third party pricing service and are based on observable market inputs. As such, the fair value of the senior notes is classified within Level 2. 
   
  8  .    Derivative Instruments 
  
  The Company s investment strategy allows for the use of derivative instruments. The Company s derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Company utilizes exchange traded U.S. Treasury note, Eurodollar and other futures contracts and commodity futures to manage portfolio duration or replicate investment positions in its portfolios and the Company routinely utilizes foreign currency forward contracts, currency options, index futures contracts and other derivatives as part of its total return objective. In addition, certain of the Company s investments are managed in portfolios which incorporate the use of foreign currency forward contracts which are intended to provide an economic hedge against foreign currency movements.  
  In addition, the Company purchases to-be-announced mortgage backed securities ( TBAs ) as part of its investment strategy. TBAs represent commitments to purchase a future issuance of agency mortgage backed securities. For the period between purchase of a TBA and issuance of the underlying security, the Company s position is accounted for as a derivative. The Company purchases TBAs in both long and short positions to enhance investment performance and as part of its overall investment strategy.  

The following table summarizes information on the fair values and notional values of the Company s derivative instruments: 

(1) 
    Represents the absolute notional value of all outstanding contracts, consisting of long and short positions. 
              (2) 
    The fair value of asset derivatives are included in  other assets  and the fair value of liability derivatives are included in  other liabilities.  
              (3) 
    The fair value of TBAs are included in  fixed maturities available for sale, at fair value.  
     The Company did not hold any derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
  The Company s derivative instruments can be traded under master netting agreements, which establish terms that apply to all derivative transactions with a counterparty. In the event of a bankruptcy or other stipulated event of default, such agreements provide that the non-defaulting party may elect to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions, in which case all individual derivative positions (loss or gain) with a counterparty are closed out and netted and replaced with a single amount, usually referred to as the termination amount, which is expressed in a single currency. The resulting single net amount, where positive, is payable to the party  in-the-money  regardless of whether or not it is the defaulting party, unless the parties have agreed that only the non-defaulting party is entitled to receive a termination payment where the net amount is positive and is in its favor. Contractual close-out netting reduces derivatives credit exposure from gross to net exposure.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , asset derivatives and liability derivatives of   $111.2 million   and   $113.2 million  , respectively, were subject to a master netting agreement, compared to   $26.5 million   and   $11.9 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . The remaining derivatives included

in the preceding table were not subject to a master netting agreement. 
  All realized and unrealized contract gains and losses on the Company s derivative instruments are reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of income, as summarized in the following table:

ACGL and its  subsidiaries which are party to the LOC Facilities were in compliance with all covenants contained in the LOC Facilities at   September 30, 2016  . At such date,   $334.2 million   in letters of credit under the LOC Facilities were outstanding, which were secured by investments with a fair value of   $386.2 million  , and had   $100.0 million   of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Under the   $500.0 million   secured letter of credit facility, ACGL s subsidiaries had remaining capacity of   $341.4 million   (outstanding letters of credit of   $158.6 million  ) at   September 30, 2016  . See Note   16  ,  Subsequent Events.  

As of   September 30, 2016  , Watford Re had a   $100.0 million   letter of credit facility expiring on   May 19, 2017   and an   $800.0 million   secured credit facility expiring on   June 4, 2018  , that provides for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit not to exceed   $400.0 million  . Borrowings of revolving loans may be made by Watford Re at a variable rate based on LIBOR or an alternative base rate at the option of Watford Re. At   September 30, 2016  , Watford Re had   $207.8 million   in outstanding letters of credit under the two facilities and   $298.1 million   of borrowings outstanding under the secured credit facility, backed by Watford Re s investment portfolio. Watford Re was in compliance with all covenants contained in both of its credit facilities at   September 30, 2016  . The Company does not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford Re, and the Company s financial exposure to Watford Re is limited to its investment in Watford Re s common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from the reinsurance transactions. 
  Investment Commitments 
  The Company s investment commitments, which are primarily related to agreements entered into by the Company to invest in funds and separately managed accounts when called upon, were approximately   $1.34 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.11 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Acquisition of United Guaranty Corporation 
  On August 15, 2016, ACGL entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) with American International Group, Inc. ( AIG ) pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, ACGL agreed to purchase from AIG all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of United Guaranty Corporation, a North Carolina corporation ( UG Corp ), and AIG United Guaranty (Asia) Limited ( AIG UG Asia  and, together with UG Corp,  UGC ). The acquisition under the Stock Purchase Agreement is referred to herein as the  UGC Acquisition.  As consideration in the UGC Acquisition, ACGL will pay to AIG aggregate consideration of approximately   $3.43 billion   (using the ACGL closing share price as of   October 27, 2016  ), consisting of the following: (i) cash consideration of approximately   $2.20 billion   (the  Base Cash Consideration  (ii) a number of shares of ACGL s convertible non-voting common-equivalent preference shares (the  Series D Preferred Shares ) which are subject to a formula and a collar and an estimated fair value (using the ACGL closing share price as of   October 27, 2016   of   $77.03   per share) of approximately   $983.1 million  , subject to adjustment and subject to certain restrictions on transfer within the first   18 months  ; and (iii) an additional amount (or if such amount is negative   $0  ) in cash equal to   $250.0 million   less the Company Dividend Amount (as defined below), if any, less the value of Perpetual Preferred Shares (as defined below) issued to AIG, if any. The Stock Purchase Agreement entitles AIG to take dividends or other  

Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

distributions from UGC in an amount not to exceed   $250.0 million   between the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the closing date of the UGC Acquisition (the amount of any such dividends or distributions, the  Company Dividend Amount ). As an additional component of the consideration for the transaction, ACGL can require AIG to accept up to   $250.0 million   of Perpetual Preferred Shares (which will have the same terms as ACGL s   5.25%   Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series E (the  Perpetual Preferred Shares ) less the Company Dividend Amount. 
  In connection with the UGC Acquisition, the   50%   quota share reinsurance agreement between United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company and three subsidiaries of AIG relating to policy years 2014, 2015 and 2016 will be amended to terminate on a run-off basis as of 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 2017.  
  The Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including: (i) the parties  mutual agreement; (ii) by either ACGL or AIG, if the closing has not occurred on or before March 31, 2017, subject to an extension at the request of either party of up to three months for the receipt of certain approvals (such date, as may be extended, the  Outside Date  (iii) by either ACGL or AIG, in the event of the issuance of a final, non-appealable governmental order restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement or in the event that any law has been enacted, promulgated or issued by any governmental authority that restrains, enjoins or prohibits the transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement or that would render the consummation of such transaction illegal; or (iv) the non-terminating party s material uncured breach of the Stock Purchase Agreement. In the event that either ACGL or AIG terminates the Stock Purchase Agreement due to a failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on or before the Outside Date and specified ACGL conditions to closing are otherwise satisfied, ACGL will pay a termination fee of   $150.0 million   to AIG. 
  Bridge Credit Agreement 
  In connection with the UGC Acquisition, the Company entered into a bridge credit agreement with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch ( CS ), as administrative agent and initial lender (the   Bridge Credit Agreement  ). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for commitments by the lenders thereunder to provide up to   $1.375 billion   of term loans (the  Bridge Loans ) to fund a portion of the cash consideration portion required in the UGC Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.  
  Commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement (or, to the extent funded, the Bridge Loans) may be voluntarily reduced (or prepaid) by ACGL without premium or penalty, other than payment of customary breakage costs. Commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement (or, to the extent funded, Bridge Loans) will be subject to mandatory reduction (or, in the case  

of Bridge Loans, mandatory prepayment), by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurrences, equity issuances and asset sales. The commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement will expire five business days after the Outside Date if the closing of the acquisition has not occurred on or prior to such date. 
  Conditions to borrowing under the Bridge Credit Agreement include the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) in United Guaranty after December 31, 2015, the concurrent consummation of the acquisition in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement, and other conditions customary for bridge financings of this type. 
  The Bridge Loans, if funded, will mature on the date that is   364 days   after funding. Bridge Loans will bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR loans would range from   0.875%   to   1.625%   per annum and for base rate loans would range from   0.0%   to   0.625%   per annum, in each case, depending on the public debt rating of ACGL then in effect, increasing by   0.25%   (with respect to each level of public debt rating) every   90 days   after funding. In addition, customary fees will be payable under the Bridge Credit Agreement and related documents. 
  The Bridge Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require ACGL to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a maximum ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth. The Bridge Credit Agreement also includes customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. These provisions are generally consistent with those in ACGL s existing revolving credit agreement. 
  Arch-U.S. will provide a guaranty of the obligations under the Bridge Credit Agreement. ACGL has the ability under the Bridge Loan Agreement to designate one of its subsidiaries to be the borrower pursuant to the terms thereof. In such case, ACGL would guarantee the obligations of the subsidiary borrower. 
  As a result of the preferred share offering in September 2016 (see note 10), the outstanding commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement were reduced to   $938.5 million   at September 30, 2016.  
   
  10  .    Share Transactions 
  
  Preferred Share Offering 
  On September 29, 2016, ACGL completed a   $450 million   underwritten public offering of   18.0 million   depositary shares (the  Depositary Shares ), each of which represents a 1/1,000th interest in a share of its   5.25%   Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series E, have a   $0.01   par value and   $25,000   liquidation preference per share (equivalent to   $25    

Table of Contents  
  ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

liquidation preference per Depositary Share) (the  Series E Preferred Shares ). Each Depositary Share, evidenced by a depositary receipt, entitles the holder, through the depositary, to a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences of the Series E Preferred Shares represented thereby (including any dividend, liquidation, redemption and voting rights). In April 2012, the Company issued   $325 million   of Series C Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares that are on parity with the Series E Preferred Shares with respect to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of ACGL.  
  Holders of Series E Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments only when, as and if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board. Any such dividends will be payable from, and including, the date of original issue on a non-cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, at an annual rate of   5.25%  . If declared, the first dividend payment date will be January 3, 2017. Dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares are not cumulative. The Company will be restricted from paying dividends on or repurchasing its common shares unless certain dividend payments are made on the Series E Preferred Shares. 
  Except in specified circumstances relating to certain tax or corporate events, the Series E Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to September 29, 2021 (the fifth anniversary of the issue date). On and after that date, the Series E Preferred Shares will be redeemable at the Company s option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of   $25,000   per share of the Series E Preferred Shares (equivalent to   $25   per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Depositary Shares will be redeemed if and to the extent the related Series E Preferred Shares are redeemed by the Company.  
  Neither the Depositary Shares nor the Series E Preferred Shares have a stated maturity, nor will they be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption. The Series E Preferred Shares are not convertible into any other securities. The Series E Preferred Shares will not have voting rights, except under limited circumstances. 
  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of   $434.9 million   to fund a portion of the UGC Acquisition, to pay related costs and expenses and for general corporate purposes. See Note 9 for further detail on the UGC Acquisition. 

Share Repurchases    
  The board of directors of ACGL has authorized the investment in ACGL s common shares through a share repurchase program. Since the inception of the share repurchase program, ACGL has repurchased approximately   125.2 million   common shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $3.68 billion  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , ACGL repurchased   1.1 million   common shares (no repurchases in the   2016 third quarter  ) for an aggregate purchase price of   $75.3 million  . During the   2015 third quarter   and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , ACGL repurchased   0.1 million   and   5.9 million   common shares, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of   $3.5 million   and   $365.4 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $446.5 million   of share repurchases were available under the program. The timing and amount of the repurchase transactions under this program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations.

13  .    Income Taxes 
  
  The Company s income tax provision on income before income taxes resulted in   an expense   of   5.7%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   an expense   of   5.5%   for the   2015   period. The Company s effective tax rate, which is based upon the expected annual effective tax rate, may fluctuate from period to period based on the relative mix of income or loss reported by jurisdiction and the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction.  
  The Company had a net deferred tax asset of   $124.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $135.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . In addition, the Company   paid     $40.7 million   and   $35.5 million   of income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  14  .    Legal Proceedings 
  
  The Company, in common with the insurance industry in general, is subject to litigation and arbitration in the normal course of its business. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not a party to any litigation or arbitration which is expected by management to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.  
   
  15  .    Transactions with Related Parties 
  
  Kewsong Lee, a director of ACGL, is a Managing Director and Deputy Chief Investment Officer for Corporate Private Equity of The Carlyle Group ( Carlyle ). As part of its investment philosophy, the Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in alternative investment funds. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had aggregate commitments of   $770.9 million   to funds managed by Carlyle, of which   $524.5 million   was unfunded. The Company may make additional commitments to funds managed by Carlyle from time to time. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company made aggregate capital contributions to funds managed by Carlyle of   $50.1 million   and   $97.7 million  , respectively, and received aggregate cash distributions from funds managed by Carlyle of   $17.9 million   and   $30.3 million  , respectively. 
   
  16  .    Subsequent Events 
  
  On October 26, 2016, ACGL and certain of its subsidiaries amended the existing Credit Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ) (see Note 9). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a   $350.0 million   secured facility for letters of credit and   $500.0 million   unsecured facility for revolving loans and letters of credit. Obligations of each borrower under the secured facility for letters of credit are  

secured by cash and eligible securities of such borrower held in collateral accounts. ACGL has a one-time option to convert any or all outstanding revolving loans of ACGL and/or Arch-U.S. to term loans with the same terms as the revolving loans except that any prepayments may not be reborrowed. Arch-U.S. guarantees the obligations of ACGL, and ACGL guarantees the obligations of Arch-U.S.  
  Commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement will expire on October 26, 2021, and all loans then outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement must be repaid. Letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement will not have an expiration date later than October 26, 2022. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, conditions to credit extensions, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default.

ITEM 2.  
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
       The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. This should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this report and also our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ( 2015 Form 10-K ). In addition, readers should review  Risk Factors  set forth in Item 1A of Part I of our 2015 Form 10-K. Tabular amounts are in U.S. Dollars in thousands, except share amounts, unless otherwise noted. 
  Arch Capital Group Ltd. ( ACGL  and, together with its subsidiaries,  we  or  us ) is a Bermuda public limited liability company with approximately   $8.24 billion   in capital at   September 30, 2016   and, through operations in Bermuda, the United States, Europe and Canada, writes specialty lines of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, as well as mortgage insurance and reinsurance, on a worldwide basis. 
  CURRENT OUTLOOK 
  
  The broad property casualty insurance market environment continues to be competitive in our business, consistent with our view in prior quarters. In our insurance segment, we experienced a slight deterioration in rates across certain sectors, while there are signs that reinsurance terms, especially ceding commissions, have bottomed out. This has led us to continue to reduce writings in certain property casualty lines in the   2016 third quarter  . With the continued low interest rate environment, additional price increases are needed in many lines in order for us to achieve our return requirements. Our underwriting teams continue to execute a disciplined strategy by emphasizing small and medium-sized accounts over large accounts and by utilizing reinsurance purchases to reduce volatility on large account, high capacity business.  
  Our mortgage segment continues to experience favorable market conditions. Within the U.S. mortgage insurance sector, Arch Mortgage Insurance Company ( Arch MI U.S. ) continues to expand into the marketplace. Our market share continued to increase, reflecting growth in the bank channel and the impact of RateStar, our risk-based pricing program, which has met with wide acceptance from bank and credit union clients. In addition, international business and credit risk-sharing transactions continue to provide growth opportunities for our mortgage operations. 
  In addition, on August 15, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) with American International Group, Inc. ( AIG ) pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to purchase from AIG all of the issued and  

outstanding shares of capital stock of United Guaranty Corporation, a North Carolina corporation, and AIG United Guaranty (Asia) Limited (combined,  United Guaranty ). The acquisition under the Stock Purchase Agreement is referred to herein as the  UGC Acquisition.  
  The UGC Acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, (i) expiration or early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act,  which has occurred, (ii) the receipt of certain approvals of regulatory authorities and government-sponsored entities, (iii) the execution of an excess of loss agreement between subsidiaries of AIG and United Guaranty and (iv) receipt by AIG of confirmation from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System that none of us, United Guaranty or any of their respective subsidiaries will be subject to  Systemically Important Financial Institutions  rules and regulations. There is no financing condition for the UGC Acquisition. For a complete description of the UGC Acquisition, please refer to our Form 8-K filed on August 15, 2016 and other documents on file with the SEC. 
  Our objective is to achieve an average operating return on average equity of 15% or greater over the insurance cycle, which we believe to be an attractive return to our common shareholders given the risks we assume. We continue to look for opportunities to find acceptable books of business to underwrite without sacrificing underwriting discipline and continue to write a portion of our overall book in catastrophe-exposed business which has the potential to increase the volatility of our operating results. 
  Changing economic conditions could have a material impact on the frequency and severity of claims and, therefore, could negatively impact our underwriting returns. In addition, volatility in the financial markets could continue to significantly affect our investment returns, reported results and shareholders  equity. We consider the potential impact of economic trends in the estimation process for establishing unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and in determining our investment strategies. In addition, weakness of the U.S., European countries and other key economies, projected budget deficits for the U.S., European countries and other governments and the consequences associated with potential downgrades of securities of the U.S., European countries and other governments by credit rating agencies is inherently unpredictable and could have a material adverse effect on financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world. In turn, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in particular, this could have a material adverse effect on the value and liquidity of securities in our investment portfolio.

NATURAL CATASTROPHE RISK 
  
  We monitor our natural catastrophe risk globally for all perils and regions, in each case, where we believe there is significant exposure. Our models employ both proprietary and vendor-based systems and include cross-line correlations for property, marine, offshore energy, aviation, workers compensation and personal accident. Currently, we seek to limit our 1-in-250 year return period net probable maximum pre-tax loss from a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone to approximately 25% of total shareholders  equity available to Arch. We reserve the right to change this threshold at any time.  
  Based on in-force exposure estimated as of   October 1, 2016  , our modeled peak zone catastrophe exposure was a windstorm affecting the Northeastern U.S., with a net probable maximum pre-tax loss of   $488 million  , followed by windstorms affecting the Gulf of Mexico and Florida Tri-County regions with net probable maximum pre-tax losses of   $418 million   and   $405 million  , respectively. Our exposures to other perils, such as U.S. earthquake and international events, were less than the exposures arising from U.S. windstorms and hurricanes. As of   October 1, 2016  , our modeled peak zone earthquake exposure (  Los Angeles earthquake  ) represented approximately   63%   of our peak zone catastrophe exposure, and our modeled peak zone international exposure (  Japan earthquake  ) was substantially less than both our peak zone windstorm and earthquake exposures.  
  Net probable maximum pre-tax loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries, before income tax and before excess reinsurance reinstatement premiums. Loss estimates are reflective of the zone indicated and not the entire portfolio. Since hurricanes and windstorms can affect more than one zone and make multiple landfalls, our loss estimates include clash estimates from other zones. The loss estimates shown above do not represent our maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates. There can be no assurances that we will not suffer a net loss greater than 25% of total shareholders  equity available to Arch from one or more catastrophic events due to several factors, including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders  equity exposed to a single catastrophic event. Actual losses may also increase if our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable. See  Risk Factors Risk Relating to Our Industry  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Natural and Man-Made Catastrophic Events  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

FINANCIAL MEASURES 
  
  Management uses the following three key financial indicators in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for ACGL s common shareholders: 
  Book Value per Common Share 
  Book value per common share represents total common shareholders  equity available to Arch divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Management uses growth in book value per common share as a key measure of the value generated for our common shareholders each period and believes that book value per common share is the key driver of ACGL s share price over time. Book value per common share is impacted by, among other factors, our underwriting results, investment returns and share repurchase activity, which has an accretive or dilutive impact on book value per common share depending on the purchase price.  
  Book value per common share was   $53.62   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $52.04   at June 30, 2016 and   $47.68   at   September 30, 2015  . The   3.0%     increase   in the   2016 third quarter   and the   12.5%     increase   over the trailing twelve months reflected strong underwriting and investment returns. 
  Operating Return on Average Common Equity 
  Operating return on average common equity ( Operating ROAE ) represents annualized after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders divided by the average of beginning and ending common shareholders  equity available to Arch during the period. After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G, represents net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses, net of income taxes. Management uses Operating ROAE as a key measure of the return generated to common shareholders and has set an objective to achieve an average Operating ROAE of 15% or greater over the insurance cycle, which it believes to be an attractive return to common shareholders given the risks we assume. See  Comment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures.   
  Our Operating ROAE was   8.8%   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   8.6%   for the   2015 third quarter  , and   9.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   9.7%   for the   2015   period. 

Table of Contents  

Total Return on Investments 
  Total return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by Arch s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses, excludes amounts reflected in the  other  segment, and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, total return incorporates the timing of investment returns during the periods. 
  The following table summarizes our total return compared to the benchmark return against which we measured our portfolio during the periods. See  Comment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  

Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, total return was   0.91%   for the   2016 third quarter   and   4.07%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Total return for the 2016 periods reflected strong returns on equities and alternatives, dampened by the impact of lower returns on investment-grade fixed income securities compared to the 2015 periods.  
  The benchmark return index is a customized combination of indices intended to approximate a target portfolio by asset mix and average credit quality while also matching the approximate estimated duration and currency mix of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Although the estimated duration and average credit quality of this index will move as the duration and rating of its constituent securities change, generally we do not adjust the composition of the benchmark return index except to incorporate changes to the mix of liability currencies and durations noted above. The benchmark return index should not be interpreted as expressing a preference for or aversion to any particular sector or sector weight. The index is intended solely to provide, unlike many master indices that change based on the size of their constituent indices, a relatively stable basket of investable indices. At   September 30, 2016  , the benchmark return index had an average credit quality of    Aa2    by Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ), and an estimated duration of   3.43   years. 

The benchmark return index included weightings to the following indices, which are primarily from The Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BoAML ): 

COMMENT ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
  
  Throughout this filing, we present our operations in the way we believe will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use our financial information in evaluating the performance of our company. This presentation includes the use of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, which is defined as net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses, net of income taxes, and the use of annualized operating return on average common equity. The presentation of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized operating return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to net income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized return on average common equity (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures) in accordance with Regulation G is included under  Results of Operations  below.  
  We believe that net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business. Although net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses are  

Table of Contents  

an integral part of our operations, the decision to realize investment gains or losses, the recognition of the change in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the fair value option in net realized gains or losses, the recognition of net impairment losses, the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and the recognition of foreign exchange gains or losses are independent of the insurance underwriting process and result, in large part, from general economic and financial market conditions. Furthermore, certain users of our financial information believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of investment gains or losses is largely opportunistic. In addition, net impairment losses recognized in earnings on our investments represent other-than-temporary declines in expected recovery values on securities without actual realization. The use of the equity method on certain of our investments in certain funds that invest in fixed maturity securities is driven by the ownership structure of such funds (either limited partnerships or limited liability companies). In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on our proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the market value of the underlying securities in the funds). This method of accounting is different from the way we account for our other fixed maturity securities and the timing of the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method may differ from gains or losses in the future upon sale or maturity of such investments. Due to these reasons, we exclude net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses from the calculation of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders.  
  We believe that showing net income available to Arch common shareholders exclusive of the items referred to above reflects the underlying fundamentals of our business since we evaluate the performance of and manage our business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income available to Arch common shareholders, we believe that this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. We also believe that this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, allows the users of financial information to compare our performance with our industry peer group. We believe that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow us and the insurance industry as a whole generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. 
  Our segment information includes the presentation of consolidated underwriting income or loss and a subtotal of underwriting income or loss before the contribution from the  other  segment. Such measures represent the pre-tax profitability of our underwriting operations and include net premiums earned plus other underwriting income, less losses  

and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include those operating expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our individual underwriting operations. Underwriting income or loss does not incorporate items included in our corporate (non-underwriting) segment. While these measures are presented in Note   5  ,  Segment Information,  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements, they are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. The reconciliations of underwriting income or loss to income before income taxes (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis and a subtotal before the contribution from the  other  segment, in accordance with Regulation G, is shown in Note   5  ,  Segment Information  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We measure segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and, accordingly, investment income and other non-underwriting related items are not allocated to each underwriting segment. For the  other  segment, performance is measured based on net income or loss. 
    
  Along with consolidated underwriting income, we provide a subtotal of underwriting income or loss before the contribution from the  other  segment. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, Watford Re is considered a variable interest entity and we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of Watford Re. As such, we consolidate the results of Watford Re in our consolidated financial statements, although we only own approximately 11% of Watford Re s common equity. Watford Re has its own management and board of directors that is responsible for its overall profitability. In addition, we do not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford Re. Since Watford Re is an independent company, the assets of Watford Re can be used only to settle obligations of Watford Re and Watford Re is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments. Our financial exposure to Watford Re is limited to our investment in Watford Re s common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from the reinsurance transactions. We believe that presenting certain information excluding the  other  segment enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how our management analyzes performance 
    
  Our presentation of segment information includes the use of a current year loss ratio which excludes favorable or adverse development in prior year loss reserves. This ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measure to the loss ratio (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in accordance with Regulation G is shown on the individual segment pages. Management utilizes the current year loss ratio in its analysis  

Table of Contents  

of the underwriting performance of each of our underwriting segments. 
  Total return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by Arch s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses, excludes amounts reflected in the  other  segment, and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, total return incorporates the timing of investment returns during the periods. There is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure for total return. Management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders on the capital held in the business, and compares the return generated by our investment portfolio against benchmark returns which we measured our portfolio against during the periods. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  
  The following table summarizes our consolidated financial data, including a reconciliation of net income available to Arch common shareholders to after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders. Each line item reflects the impact of our approximate 11% ownership of Watford Re s common equity. 

Segment Information 
  We classify our businesses into three underwriting segments   insurance, reinsurance and mortgage   and two other operating segments   corporate (non-underwriting) and  other.  Our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments each have managers who are responsible for the overall profitability of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision makers, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer of ACGL. The chief operating decision makers do not assess performance, measure return on equity or make resource allocation decisions on a line of business basis. Management measures segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not  

Table of Contents  

manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and, accordingly, investment income is not allocated to each underwriting segment. 
  We determined our reportable segments using the management approach described in accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Intersegment business is allocated to the segment accountable for the underwriting results.  
  Insurance Segment 
  The following tables set forth our insurance segment s underwriting results: 

The insurance segment consists of our insurance underwriting units which offer specialty product lines on a worldwide basis. Product lines include:

Table of Contents  

program managers with unique expertise and niche products offering general liability, commercial automobile, inland marine and property business with minimal catastrophe exposure. 
             
    Property, energy, marine and aviation:   primary and excess general property insurance coverages, including catastrophe-exposed property coverage, for commercial clients. Coverages for marine include hull, war, specie and liability. Aviation and stand alone terrorism are also offered. 
                
    Travel, accident and health:   specialty travel and accident and related insurance products for individual, group travelers, travel agents and suppliers, as well as accident and health, which provides accident, disability and medical plan insurance coverages for employer groups, medical plan members, students and other participant groups. 
                
    Other:   includes alternative market risks (including captive insurance programs), excess workers  compensation and employer s liability insurance coverages for qualified self-insured groups, associations and trusts, and contract and commercial surety coverages, including contract bonds (payment and performance bonds) primarily for medium and large contractors and commercial surety bonds for Fortune 1,000 companies and smaller transaction business programs. 
     Premiums Written  . 
  The following table sets forth our insurance segment s net premiums written by major line of business: 

2016 Third Quarter   versus   2015 Third Quarter  . Gross premiums written by the insurance segment in the   2016 third quarter   were   0.9%     higher   than in the   2015 third quarter  , while net premiums written were   0.3%     lower   than in the   2015 third quarter  . The decrease in net premiums written reflected reductions in programs and property lines, partially offset by growth in travel and in  other  lines including alternative markets and high excess comp business. The reduction in  

program business primarily reflected the continued impact of the non-renewal of a large program in the latter part of 2015 while the lower level in property lines reflected continued weak market conditions. The growth in travel and alternative markets reflected both new business and continued expansion in existing accounts while the increase in high excess comp primarily reflected new business. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   period  . Gross premiums written by the insurance segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   2.5%     higher   than in the   2015   period, while net premiums written were   0.8%     higher   than in the   2015   period.  The increase in net premiums written reflected growth in travel, accident and health, construction and national accounts and alternative markets business, partially offset by a reduction in programs and property lines. The growth in travel, accident and health reflected both new business and continued expansion in existing accounts. The increase in construction and national accounts primarily reflected new business and audit premiums while the increase in alternative markets resulted from new accounts, exposure growth and audit premiums. The reduction in program business primarily reflected the continued impact of the non-renewal of a large program in the latter part of 2015 while the lower level of net premiums written in property lines reflected continued weak market conditions.  

Table of Contents  

Net Premiums Earned  . 
  The following tables set forth our insurance segment s net premiums earned by major line of business: 

Net premiums written are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies for all products, usually 12 months. Net premiums earned reflect changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters. Net premiums earned in the   2016 third quarter   were   0.7%     lower   than in the   2015 third quarter   and   1.3%     higher   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   than in the   2015   period.  
  Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses  . 
  The table below shows the components of the insurance segment s loss ratio: 

Current Year Loss Ratio  . 
  The insurance segment s current year loss ratio in the   2016 third quarter   was   0.2   points   lower   than in the   2015 third quarter   and the current year loss ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   0.5   points   higher   than in the   2015   period. The   2016 third quarter   loss ratio reflected   0.3   points of current year catastrophic activity, compared to   1.6   points in the   2015 third quarter  , and   1.5   points for the    nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.2   points for the   2015   period. The current year loss ratio for the 2016 periods reflected a higher level of large attritional losses than in the   2015   period.  
  Prior Period Reserve Development  . 
  2016 Third Quarter  :   The insurance segment s net favorable development of   $13.7 million  , or   2.6   points, consisted of $18.2 million of net favorable development in long-tailed lines, partially offset by $2.4 million of net adverse development in short-tailed lines and $2.0 million of net adverse development in medium-tailed lines. Net favorable development in long-tailed lines reflected net reductions in executive assurance reserves from the 2008 to 2015 accident years (  i.e.  , the year in which a loss occurred), and net reductions in casualty reserves from the 2007 and 2008 accident years. Net adverse development in short-tailed lines primarily resulted from property (including special risk other than marine) reserves from the 2015 accident year, primarily due to a small number of attritional losses. Net adverse development in medium-tailed lines primarily resulted from an increase in programs of $6.2 million stemming in part from terminated programs, partially offset by favorable development of $4.2 million in other medium-tailed lines, primarily in professional liability and surety. 
  2015 Third Quarter  : The insurance segment s net favorable development of   $9.9 million  , or   1.9   points, consisted of $12.9 million of net favorable development in medium-tailed lines and long-tailed lines partially offset by $3.0 million of net adverse development in short-tailed lines. Net favorable development in medium-tailed and long-tailed lines reflected favorable development in professional lines of $14.5 million, which included $10.8 million of favorable development in executive assurance reserves primarily from the 2007 to 2012 accident years (i.e., the year in which a loss occurred) with the remainder in professional liability and healthcare reserves. Such amounts were partially offset by $2.4 million of adverse development in programs, primarily from the 2014 accident year. Adverse development in short-tailed lines primarily resulted from travel, accident and health business in the 2014 accident year, partially offset by a reduction in property (including special risk other than marine) reserves from the 2012 to 2014 accident years. Development on the 2005 to 2014 named catastrophic events was adverse by $0.6 million in the quarter. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016  :   The insurance segment s net favorable development of   $24.8 million  , or   1.6   points, consisted of $36.2 million of net favorable  

Table of Contents  

development in long-tailed lines and $7.7 million of net favorable development in short-tailed lines, partially offset by $19.1 million of net adverse development in medium-tailed lines. Net favorable development in long-tailed lines reflected net reductions in executive assurance reserves from the 2008 to 2009 accident years and 2011 to 2013 accident years, and net reductions in casualty reserves across most accident years, partially offset by a large energy casualty claim from the 2015 accident year. Net favorable development in short-tailed lines primarily resulted from reductions in property (including special risk other than marine) reserves from the 2009 to 2014 accident years, primarily due to varying levels of reported claims activity. Such amount included $9.2 million of favorable development on the 2005 to 2015 named catastrophic events. Net adverse development in medium-tailed lines primarily resulted from an increase in programs of $28.6 million stemming in part from terminated programs, partially offset by favorable development of $9.5 million in other medium-tailed lines, primarily in professional liability and surety.   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  : The insurance segment s net favorable development of   $37.2 million  , or   2.4   points, consisted of $22.6 million of net favorable development in short-tailed lines and $14.6 million of net favorable development in medium-tailed and long-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines primarily consisted of reductions in property (including special risk other than marine) reserves from the 2011 to 2014 accident years, primarily due to varying levels of reported claims activity. Development on the 2005 to 2014 named catastrophic events was favorable by $2.3 million for the 2015 period. Net favorable development in medium-tailed and long-tailed lines reflected favorable development in marine reserves, primarily from the 2010 to 2014 accident years, and in surety reserves, primarily from the 2013 to 2014 accident years. In addition, the insurance segment s results reflected net favorable development in professional lines of $17.5 million, including favorable development in healthcare reserves, primarily from the 2005 to 2011 accident years, and in executive assurance reserves, primarily from the 2010 to 2012 accident years, partially offset by an increase in reserves on professional liability reserves, primarily in the 2011 and 2012 accident years. In addition, the insurance segment s results reflected net adverse development in programs of $13.4 million, primarily from the 2014 accident year. 
  Underwriting Expenses  . 
  2016 Third Quarter   versus   2015 Third Quarter  :   The insurance segment s underwriting expense ratio was   31.8%   in the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   31.0%   in the   2015 third quarter  . The comparison of the underwriting expense ratios and the underlying acquisition expense and other operating expense ratios reflects changes in the level of reinsurance ceded on a quota share basis and changes in the mix of business. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   period:   The insurance segment s underwriting expense ratio was   31.7%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   31.9%   for the   2015   period. The comparison of the underwriting expense ratios and the underlying acquisition expense and other operating expense ratios reflects changes in the level of reinsurance ceded on a quota share basis and changes in the mix of business. 
  Reinsurance Segment    
  The following tables set forth our reinsurance segment s underwriting results: 

Table of Contents  

The reinsurance segment consists of our reinsurance underwriting units which offer specialty product lines on a worldwide basis. Product lines include: 
             
    Casualty:   provides coverage to ceding company clients on third party liability and workers  compensation exposures from ceding company clients, primarily on a treaty basis. Exposures include, among others, executive assurance, professional liability, workers  compensation, excess and umbrella liability, excess motor and healthcare business. 
                
    Marine and aviation:   provides coverage for energy, hull, cargo, specie, liability and transit, and aviation business, including airline and general aviation risks. Business written may also include space business, which includes coverages for satellite assembly, launch and operation for commercial space programs. 
                
    Other specialty:   provides coverage to ceding company clients for proportional motor and other lines including surety, accident and health, workers  compensation catastrophe, agriculture, trade credit and political risk. 
                
    Property catastrophe:   provides protection for most catastrophic losses that are covered in the underlying policies written by reinsureds, including hurricane, earthquake, flood, tornado, hail and fire, and coverage for other perils on a case-by-case basis. Property catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage on an excess of loss basis when aggregate losses and loss adjustment expense from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the retention specified in the contract. 
                
    Property excluding property catastrophe:   provides coverage for both personal lines and commercial property exposures and principally covers buildings, structures, equipment and contents. The primary perils in this business include fire, explosion, collapse, riot, vandalism, wind, tornado, flood and earthquake. Business is assumed on both a proportional and excess of loss basis. In addition, facultative business is written which focuses on commercial property risks on an excess of loss basis. 
                
    Other.   includes life reinsurance business on both a proportional and non-proportional basis, casualty clash business and, in limited instances, non-traditional business which is intended to provide insurers with risk management solutions that complement traditional reinsurance.  

Premiums Written  . 
  The following table sets forth our reinsurance segment s net premiums written by major line of business: 

2016 Third Quarter   versus   2015 Third Quarter  . Gross premiums written by the reinsurance segment in the   2016 third quarter   were   1.5%     lower   than in the   2015 third quarter  , while net premiums written were   1.0%     lower   than in the   2015 third quarter  . The decrease in net premiums written reflected reductions in casualty and marine and aviation lines, due in part to reductions in premium estimates reflecting current market conditions. Such amounts were partially offset by growth in other specialty business, reflecting additional agriculture business and strong renewals on pro rata U.K. motor business. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   period  . Gross premiums written by the reinsurance segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   5.3%     higher   than in the   2015   period, while net premiums written were   1.1%     higher   than in the   2015   period. Premiums written reflects the 2016 second quarter loss portfolio transfer in the other specialty line which resulted in $52.1 million of gross premiums written and $40.2 million of net premiums written. Such premium was substantially earned in the period and resulted in a corresponding increase to losses and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by decreases in   

Table of Contents  

property catastrophe and marine and aviation lines, reflecting competitive market conditions and a higher level of ceded premiums.  
  Net Premiums Earned  . 
  The following tables set forth our reinsurance segment s net premiums earned by major line of business: 

Net premiums written, irrespective of the class of business, are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts. Net premiums earned for the   2016 third quarter   were   3.3%     lower   than in the   2015 third quarter   and   1.2%     lower   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   than in the   2015   period. Net premiums earned reflects the loss portfolio transfer noted above along with changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters. 
  Other Underwriting Income  . 
  Other underwriting income was   $2.2 million   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $2.8 million   for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $22.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.9 million   for the   2015   period. The 2016 period included $19.1 million related to a contract which was commuted during the 2016 second quarter. This contract had been reflected as a deposit accounting liability (i.e., a contract that, in accordance with GAAP, does not pass risk transfer) prior to the commutation.

  The reinsurance segment s current year loss ratio in the   2016 third quarter   was   1.9   points   higher   than in the   2015 third quarter  , and   5.1   points   higher   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   than in the   2015   period. The   2016 third quarter   loss ratio reflected   4.1   points of current year catastrophic activity, compared to   4.2   points in the   2015 third quarter  , and   3.9   points for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   2.8   points in the   2015   period. In addition, the loss ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflects the impact of the loss portfolio transfer noted above (net premiums earned at a high loss ratio), which increased the current year loss ratio by 2.8 points for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The 2016 ratios also reflected the impact of higher attritional losses than in the 2015 periods. 
  Prior Period Reserve Development  . 
  2016 Third Quarter  : The reinsurance segment s net favorable development of   $59.5 million  , or   23.6   points, consisted of $27.7 million from short-tailed lines and $31.8 million from long-tailed and medium-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines included $23.2 million from property catastrophe and property other than property catastrophe reserves, across most underwriting years (  i.e.  , all premiums and losses attributable to contracts having an inception or renewal date within the given twelve-month period). The net reduction of loss estimates for the reinsurance segment s short-tailed lines primarily resulted from varying levels of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated which led to decreases in certain loss ratio selections during the period. Favorable development in long-tailed lines reflected reductions in casualty reserves of $29.3 million based on varying levels of reported and paid claims activity, primarily from the 2002 to 2010 underwriting years and 2012 to 2013 underwriting years. 
  2015 Third Quarter  : The reinsurance segment s net favorable development of   $49.9 million  , or   19.2   points, consisted of $19.2 million from short-tailed lines and $30.7 million from long-tailed and medium-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines included $15.6 million from property catastrophe and property other than property catastrophe reserves, primarily from the 2012 to 2014 underwriting years. Development from the 2005 to 2014 named catastrophic

events was negligible in the 2015 third quarter. The net reduction of loss estimates for the reinsurance segment s short-tailed lines primarily resulted from varying levels of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated which led to decreases in certain loss ratio selections during the period. Favorable development in long-tailed lines reflected reductions in casualty reserves of $26.2 million based on varying levels of reported and paid claims activity, primarily from the 2003 to 2009 underwriting years. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016  : The reinsurance segment s net favorable development of   $176.7 million  , or   22.0   points, consisted of $113.1 million from short-tailed lines and $63.6 million from long-tailed and medium-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines included $92.6 million from property catastrophe and property other than property catastrophe reserves, across most underwriting years. Such amount included $3.9 million of favorable development from the 2005 to 2015 named catastrophic events. The net reduction of loss estimates for the reinsurance segment s short-tailed lines primarily resulted from varying levels of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated which led to decreases in certain loss ratio selections during the period. Favorable development in long-tailed lines reflected reductions in casualty reserves of $66.4 million based on varying levels of reported and paid claims activity, primarily from the 2002 to 2013 underwriting years. Such amounts were partially offset by net adverse development on marine reserves, primarily from the 2002 and 2015 underwriting years, partially offset by favorable development from most other underwriting years. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  : The reinsurance segment s net favorable development of   $165.8 million  , or   20.4   points, consisted of $80.0 million from short-tailed lines and $85.8 million from long-tailed and medium-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines included $61.5 million from property catastrophe and property other than property catastrophe reserves, primarily from the 2012 to 2014 underwriting years. Contained within this release was favorable development from the 2005 to 2014 named catastrophic events of $10.3 million. The net reduction of loss estimates for the reinsurance segment s short-tailed lines primarily resulted from varying levels of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated which led to decreases in certain loss ratio selections during the period. Favorable development in long-tailed lines reflected reductions in casualty reserves of $74.7 million, primarily from the 2003 to 2009 underwriting years based on varying levels of reported and paid claims activity, and a reduction of $6.8 million in marine and aviation reserves, across most underwriting years. 
  Underwriting Expenses  . 
  2016 Third Quarter   versus   2015 Third Quarter  :   The underwriting expense ratio for the reinsurance segment was   34.0%   in the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   35.6%   in the   2015 third quarter  . The acquisition expense ratio for the   2016 third quarter   was   19.9%  , compared to   21.3%   for the   2015  

third quarter  . The operating expense ratio for the   2016 third quarter   was   14.1%  , compared to   14.3%   in the   2015 third quarter  . 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   period:   The underwriting expense ratio for the reinsurance segment was   33.6%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   34.9%   for the   2015   period. The ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflected approximately 1.7 points of benefit from the loss portfolio transfer noted above (net premiums earned with no related expenses). The acquisition expense ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   20.0%  , compared to   20.9%   for the   2015   period. The operating expense ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   13.6%  , compared to   14.0%   for the   2015   period. 
  Mortgage Segment    
  The following tables set forth our mortgage segment s underwriting results: 

Table of Contents  

The mortgage segment includes the results of Arch MI U.S. and Arch Mortgage Insurance Designated Activity Company, leading providers of mortgage insurance products and services to the U.S. and European markets, respectively. Arch MI U.S. is approved as an eligible mortgage insurer by Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ), each a government sponsored enterprise, or  GSE.  The mortgage segment also includes GSE credit risk-sharing transactions and mortgage reinsurance for the U.S. and Australian markets. 
  Premiums Written  . 
  The following table sets forth our mortgage segment s net premiums written by client location and underwriting location (  i.e.  , where the business is underwritten): 

2016 Third Quarter   versus   2015 Third Quarter  . Gross premiums written by the mortgage segment in the   2016 third quarter   were   76.4%     higher   than in the   2015 third quarter  , reflecting growth in Australian mortgage reinsurance, in U.S. primary business and from GSE credit risk-sharing transactions receiving insurance accounting treatment. The lower increase in net premiums written of   20.5%   reflected a $45.4 million retrocession on Australian mortgage  

reinsurance business covering exposures written since May 2015. Roughly three fourths of the   2016 third quarter   retrocession represented catch up premiums. The persistency rate, which represents the percentage of mortgage insurance in force at the beginning of a 12-month period that remains in force at the end of such period, of the Arch MI U.S. portfolio of mortgage loans was   75.4%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   75.6%   at June 30, 2016. The persistency rates continue to reflect mortgage refinance activity and the low interest rate environment. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   period  . Net premiums written for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   65.5  %   higher   than for the   2015   period, reflecting growth in Australian mortgage reinsurance and in U.S. primary business and from GSE credit risk-sharing transactions receiving insurance accounting treatment.  
  Arch MI U.S. generated   $8.75 billion   of new insurance written ( NIW ) during the   2016 third quarter  , of which approximately 79% was from banks and other non-credit union mortgage originators. NIW represents the original principal balance of all loans that received coverage during the period.  

Table of Contents  

Net Premiums Earned  . 
  The following tables set forth our mortgage segment s net premiums earned by client location and underwriting location: 

Net premiums earned for the   2016   periods were higher than in the   2015   periods, primarily due to the growth in insurance in force for Arch MI U.S. along with a higher earned contribution from the mortgage segment s reinsurance business.  
  Other Underwriting Income  . 
  Other underwriting income, which is primarily related to GSE risk-sharing transactions receiving derivative accounting treatment, was   $4.7 million   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $3.6 million   for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $12.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.0 million   for the   2015   period (which included approximately $3.4 million of catch up income due to the timing of the insurance product and securitization transactions). 
  Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses  . 
  Unlike property and casualty business for which we estimate ultimate losses on premiums earned, losses on mortgage insurance business are only recorded at the time a borrower is delinquent on their mortgage, in accordance with mortgage insurance industry practice. Because our mortgage insurance reserving process does not take into account the impact of future losses from loans that are not in default, mortgage insurance loss reserves are not an estimate of ultimate losses. In addition to establishing loss reserves for loans in default,  

under GAAP, we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve for our mortgage insurance products if the amount of expected future losses for a particular product and maintenance costs for such product exceeds expected future premiums, existing reserves and the anticipated investment income for such product. We evaluate whether a premium deficiency exists quarterly. No such reserve was established in the   2016 third quarter  . 
  The table below shows the components of the mortgage segment s loss ratio: 

Current Year Loss Ratio  . 
  The mortgage segment s current year loss ratio was   7.2   points   lower   in the   2016 third quarter   than in the   2015 third quarter  , and   8.2   points   lower   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   than in the   2015   period. The current year loss ratio for the 2016 periods reflect higher premiums driven by growth in insurance in force, the impact of a low number of delinquent loans and a lower claim rate on such loans.  
  Prior Period Reserve Development  . 
  The mortgage segment s net favorable development was   $2.5 million  , or   3.2   points, for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $4.0 million  , or   7.3   points, for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $16.3 million  , or   7.9   points, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.7 million  , or   4.9   points, for the    2015   period. The reduction in all periods was primarily driven by continued lower than expected claim rates across certain origination years. 
  Underwriting Expenses  . 
  2016 Third Quarter   versus   2015 Third Quarter  . The underwriting expense ratio for the mortgage segment was   43.1%   in the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   57.7%   in the   2015 third quarter  , with the improvement primarily resulting from a higher level of net premiums earned in the   2016 third quarter  . The acquisition expense ratio was   10.1%   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   19.1%   for the   2015 third quarter   while the operating expense ratio was   33.0%   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   38.6%   in the   2015 third quarter  .  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   period  . The underwriting expense ratio for the mortgage segment was   48.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   58.5%   for the   2015   period, with the improvement primarily resulting from a higher level of net premiums earned in the 2016 period. The acquisition expense ratio was   12.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30,  

Table of Contents  

2016  , compared to   19.7%   for the   2015   period. The operating expense ratio was   36.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   38.8%   for the   2015   period. 
  Corporate (Non-Underwriting) Segment 
  The corporate (non-underwriting) segment results include net investment income, other income (loss), corporate expenses, interest expense, net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses included in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes and items related to our non-cumulative preferred shares. Such amounts exclude the results of the  other  segment. 
  Net Investment Income. 
  The components of net investment income were derived from the following sources: 

(1) 
    Amounts include dividends and interest distributions on investment funds and other items. 
      The pre-tax investment income yield, calculated based on amortized cost and on an annualized basis, was   1.81%   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   2.04%   for the   2015 third quarter  , and   1.95%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   2.06%   for the   2015   period. The comparability of net investment income between the periods was influenced by our share repurchase program, as well as the effects of low prevailing interest rates available in the market. Yields in the future may vary based on financial market conditions, investment allocation decisions and other factors. 
  Corporate Expenses. 
  Corporate expenses were   $18.5 million   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $10.7 million   for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $45.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $37.5 million   for the   2015   period. The  

higher level of corporate expenses in the   2016 third quarter   was primarily due to nonrecurrent costs related to the UGC Acquisition. 
  Interest Expense. 
  Interest expense was   $12.9 million   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $12.0 million   for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $38.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $28.8 million   for the   2015   period. The lower level of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily resulted from a reduction in interest expense in the 2015 second quarter on a deposit accounting liability contract. Such contract was commuted in the 2016 second quarter (see the reinsurance segment discussion above). Interest expense reflects amounts related to our outstanding senior notes, revolving credit agreement borrowings and other. 
  Net Realized Gains or Losses. 
  We recorded net realized   gains   of   $95.9 million   for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to net realized   losses   of   $53.5 million   for the   2015 third quarter  , and net realized   gains   of   $168.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to net realized   losses   of   $14.8 million   for the   2015   period. Currently, our portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain guidelines. The effect of financial market movements on the investment portfolio will directly impact net realized gains and losses as the portfolio is adjusted and rebalanced. Net realized gains or losses from the sale of fixed maturities primarily results from our decisions to reduce credit exposure, to change duration targets, to rebalance our portfolios or due to relative value determinations. Net realized gains or losses also includes realized and unrealized contract gains and losses on our derivative instruments, changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for using the fair value option along with re-measurement of contingent consideration liability amounts.  
  Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings. 
  We recorded   $3.9 million   of impairment losses for the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $5.9 million   for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $16.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $12.8 million   for the   2015   period. The impairment losses recorded for the 2016 periods primarily related to corporate bonds, equities and other investments, with smaller contributions from other sectors. See note   6  ,  Investment Information Other-Than-Temporary Impairments,  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Investment Funds Accounted for Using the Equity Method. 
  We recorded   $16.7 million   of equity in net income related to investment funds accounted for using the equity method in the   2016 third quarter  , compared to   $2.1 million   loss for the   2015 third quarter  , and   $32.1 million   of equity in net income  

Table of Contents  

for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $19.9 million   of equity in net income for the   2015   period. Investment funds accounted for using the equity method totaled   $797.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $593.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Net Foreign Exchange Gains or Losses. 
  Net foreign exchange   losses   for the   2016 third quarter   were   $4.2 million  , compared to net foreign exchange   gains   for the   2015 third quarter   of   $16.1 million  . Net foreign exchange   losses   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $3.8 million  , compared to net foreign exchange   gains   for the   2015   period of   $60.3 million  . Amounts in such periods were primarily unrealized and resulted from the effects of revaluing our net insurance liabilities required to be settled in foreign currencies at each balance sheet date.  
  Income Tax Expense. 
  Our income tax provision on income before income taxes resulted in   an expense   of   5.1%   for the   2016 third quarter   and   6.7%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   an expense   of   10.5%   for the   2015 third quarter   and   5.7%   for the 2015 period. Our effective tax rate, which is based upon the expected annual effective tax rate, may fluctuate from period to period based on the relative mix of income or loss reported by jurisdiction and the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. 
  Other Segment    
  The  other  segment includes the results of Watford Re. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, Watford Re is considered a variable interest entity and we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of Watford Re. As such, we consolidate the results of Watford Re in our consolidated financial statements, although we only own approximately 11% of  Watford Re s common equity. See note   3  ,  Variable Interest Entities and Noncontrolling Interests  and note   5  ,  Segment Information,  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for additional information on Watford Re.  
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,  
  ESTIMATES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  
  Critical accounting policies, estimates and recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our 2015 Form 10-K, updated where applicable in the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements, including note   2  ,  Recent Accounting Pronouncements.  

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  
  Financial Condition 
  Investable Assets    
  At   September 30, 2016  , total investable assets of   $17.88 billion   included   $16.04 billion   managed by Arch and   $1.84 billion   included in the  other  segment (  i.e.  , attributable to Watford Re). 
             
    Investable Assets Managed by Arch    
     The finance, investment and risk management ( FI R ) committee of our board of directors establishes our investment policies and sets the parameters for creating guidelines for our investment managers. The FI R committee reviews the implementation of the investment strategy on a regular basis. Our current approach stresses preservation of capital, market liquidity and diversification of risk. While maintaining our emphasis on preservation of capital and liquidity, we expect our portfolio to become more diversified and, as a result, we may expand into areas which are not currently part of our investment strategy. Our Chief Investment Officer administers the investment portfolio, oversees our investment managers and formulates investment strategy in conjunction with the FI R committee. 

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the fair value of the investable assets managed by Arch: 

(1) 
    In securities lending transactions, we receive collateral in excess of the fair value of the securities pledged. For purposes of this table, we have excluded the collateral received under securities lending, at fair value and included the securities pledged under securities lending, at fair value. 
              (2) 
    Includes investments carried as available for sale, at fair value and at fair value under the fair value option. 
     At   September 30, 2016  , our fixed income portfolio, which includes fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, had average credit quality ratings from Standard   Poor s Rating Services ( S P )/Moody s of    AA/Aa2    and an average yield to maturity (embedded book yield), before investment expenses, of   1.78%  . At   December 31, 2015  , our fixed income portfolio had average credit quality ratings from S P/Moody s of    AA/Aa2    and an average yield to maturity of   2.16%  . Our investment portfolio had an average effective duration of   3.31   years at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.43   years at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $11.46 billion  , or   71%  , of total investable assets managed by Arch were internally managed, compared to   $10.01 billion  , or   68%  , at   December 31, 2015  .  

The following table summarizes our fixed maturities and fixed maturities pledged under securities lending agreements ( Fixed Maturities ) by type: 

At   September 30, 2016  , below-investment grade securities comprised approximately   6%   of our Fixed Maturities, compared to   5%   at   December 31, 2015  . In accordance with our investment strategy, we invest in high yield fixed income securities which are included in  Corporate bonds.  Upon issuance, these securities are typically rated below investment grade (i.e., rating assigned by the major rating agencies of  BB+  or less). At   September 30, 2016  , corporate bonds represented   62%   of the total below investment grade securities at fair value, mortgage backed securities represented   17%   of the total and   21%   were in other classes. At   December 31, 2015  , corporate bonds represented   70%   of the total below investment grade securities at fair value, mortgage backed securities represented   13%   of the total and   17%   were in other classes. Unrealized losses include the impact of foreign exchange movements on certain securities denominated in foreign currencies and, as such, the amount of securities in an unrealized loss position fluctuates due to foreign currency movements. 

Table of Contents  

The following table provides the credit quality distribution of our Fixed Maturities. For individual fixed maturities, S P ratings are used. In the absence of an S P rating, ratings from Moody s are used, followed by ratings from Fitch Ratings.

    Includes U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage backed securities and agency commercial mortgage backed securities. 
     The following table provides information on the severity of the unrealized loss position as a percentage of amortized cost for all Fixed Maturities which were in an unrealized loss position: 

The following table provides information on the severity of the unrealized loss position as a percentage of amortized cost for non-investment grade Fixed Maturities which were in an unrealized loss position: 

We determine estimated recovery values for our Fixed Maturities following a review of the business prospects, credit ratings, estimated loss given default factors and information received from asset managers and rating agencies for each security. For structured securities, we utilize underlying data, where available, for each security provided by asset managers and additional information from credit agencies in order to determine an expected recovery value for each security. The analysis provided by the asset managers includes expected cash flow projections under base case and stress case scenarios which modify expected default expectations and loss severities and slow down prepayment assumptions.  
  The following table summarizes our top ten exposures to fixed income corporate issuers by fair value at   September 30, 2016  , excluding guaranteed amounts and covered bonds:

    Average credit ratings as assigned by S P and Moody s, respectively. 
     Our portfolio includes investments, such as mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk. At   September 30, 2016  , our investments in residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ) amounted to approximately   $577.1 million  , or   3.6%   of total investable  

Table of Contents  

assets managed by Arch, compared to   $812.6 million  , or   5.5%  , at   December 31, 2015  .  As with other fixed income investments, the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment. Changes in interest rates can expose us to changes in the prepayment rate on these investments. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and RMBS are prepaid more quickly, requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates. Conversely, in periods of rising rates, mortgage prepayments generally fall, preventing us from taking full advantage of the higher level of rates. However, economic conditions may curtail prepayment activity if refinancing becomes more difficult, thus limiting prepayments on RMBS.  
  The residential mortgage market in the U.S has experienced a variety of difficulties in certain underwriting periods and is only recently recovering from a period of severe home price depreciation. It is uncertain whether this recovery will continue. A decline or an extended flattening in residential property values may result in additional increases in delinquencies and losses on residential mortgage loans generally, especially with respect to any residential mortgage loans where the aggregate loan amounts (including any subordinate loans) are close to or greater than the related property values. These developments may have a significant adverse effect on the prices of loans and securities, including those in our investment portfolio. The situation continues to have wide ranging consequences, including downward pressure on economic growth and the potential for increased insurance and reinsurance exposures, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations.  
    
  Our portfolio also includes commercial mortgage backed securities ( CMBS ). At   September 30, 2016  , CMBS constituted approximately   $618.2 million  , or   3.9%   of total investable assets managed by Arch, compared to   $764.2 million  , or   5.2%  , at   December 31, 2015  . The commercial real estate market may experience price deterioration, which could lead to delinquencies and losses on commercial real estate mortgages. 

The following table provides information on our non-agency RMBS and non-agency CMBS at   September 30, 2016   by issuance year, excluding amounts guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Non-agency RMBS and non-agency CMBS were   0.5%   and   3.4%   of total investable assets managed by Arch, respectively. 

(1) 
    Loans defeased with government/agency obligations were not material to the collateral underlying our CMBS holdings.

    Including rate reduction bonds, commodities, home equity, U.K. securitized and other. 
      At   September 30, 2016  , our fixed income portfolio included   $40.3 million   par value in sub-prime securities with a fair value of   $30.9 million   and average credit quality ratings from S P/Moody s of    CCC/Caa3  .  At   December 31, 2015  , our fixed income portfolio included   $45.5 million   par value in sub-prime securities with a fair value of   $35.9 million   and average credit quality ratings from S P/Moody s of    CCC/Caa3  .  Such amounts were primarily in the home equity sector of our ABS, with the balance in other ABS, RMBS and CMBS sectors. We define sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low FICO scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. 

The following table provides information on the fair value of our Eurozone investments at   September 30, 2016  :

unrealized losses on equity securities were on holdings which have been in a continual unrealized loss position for less than 12 months at   September 30, 2016  . We believe that a reasonable period of time exists to allow for recovery of the cost basis of our equity securities that are in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table summarizes our other investments: 

(1) 
    Includes fund investments with strategies in mortgage servicing rights, transportation and infrastructure assets and other. 
     Certain of our other investments are in investment funds for which we have the option to redeem at agreed upon values as described in each investment fund s subscription agreement. Depending on the terms of the various subscription agreements, investments in investment funds may be redeemed daily, monthly, quarterly or on other terms. Two common redemption restrictions which may impact our ability to redeem these investment funds are gates and lockups. A gate is a suspension of redemptions which may be implemented by the general partner or investment manager of the fund in order to defer, in whole or in part, the redemption request in the event the aggregate amount of redemption requests exceeds a predetermined percentage of the investment fund s net assets which may otherwise hinder the general partner or investment manager s ability to liquidate holdings in an orderly fashion in order to generate the cash necessary to fund extraordinarily large redemption payouts. A lockup period is the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to hold the security before having the ability to redeem. If our investment is eligible to be redeemed, the time to redeem such investment can take weeks or months following the notification. 
  Certain of our investment managers may use leverage to achieve a higher rate of return on their assets under management, primarily those included in  other investments available for sale, at fair value,   investments accounted for using the fair value option  and  investments accounted for using the equity method  on our balance sheet. While  

leverage presents opportunities for increasing the total return of such investments, it may increase losses as well. Accordingly, any event that adversely affects the value of the underlying holdings would be magnified to the extent leverage is used and our potential losses would be magnified. In addition, the structures used to generate leverage may lead to such investments being required to meet covenants based on market valuations and asset coverage. Market valuation declines could force the sale of investments into a depressed market, which may result in significant additional losses. Alternatively, the levered investments may attempt to delever by raising additional equity or potentially changing the terms of the established financing arrangements. We may choose to participate in the additional funding of such investments. 
  Our investment strategy allows for the use of derivative instruments. We utilize various derivative instruments such as futures contracts to enhance investment performance, replicate investment positions or manage market exposures and duration risk that would be allowed under our investment guidelines if implemented in other ways. See note   8  ,  Derivative Instruments,  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures concerning derivatives. 
  Accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP and provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP. See note   7  ,  Fair Value,  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   segregated by level in the fair value hierarchy. 
             
    Investable Assets in the  Other  Segment 
     Investable assets in the  other  segment are managed by Watford Re. The board of directors of Watford Re establishes their investment policies and guidelines. Watford Re s investments are accounted for using the fair value option with changes in the carrying value of such investments recorded in net realized gains or losses.

Premiums Receivable and Reinsurance Recoverables 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   85.7%   of premiums receivable of   $1.18 billion   represented amounts not yet due, while amounts in excess of 90 days overdue were   4.8%   of the total. At   December 31, 2015  ,   80.8%   of premiums receivable of   $983.4 million   represented amounts not yet due, while amounts in excess of 90 days overdue were   5.3%   of the total. Our reserves for doubtful accounts were approximately   $19.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   73.6%   and   77.9%   of reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses (not including prepaid reinsurance premiums) of   $2.08 billion   and   $1.87 billion  , respectively, were due from carriers which had an A.M. Best rating of  A-  or better while   26.4%   and   22.1%  , respectively, were from companies not rated. For items not rated, over 90% of such amount was collateralized through reinsurance trusts or letters of credit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The largest reinsurance recoverables from any one carrier was approximately   2.8%   and   3.4%  , respectively, of total shareholders  equity available to Arch. 
  Approximately   7.4%   of the   $26.5 million   of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable at   September 30, 2016   were more than 90 days overdue, compared to   3.9%   of the   $38.5 million   of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable at   December 31, 2015  . No collection issues were indicated on the amount in excess of 90 days overdue at   September 30, 2016  .  

The effects of reinsurance on written and earned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ) with unaffiliated reinsurers were as follows: 

Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses    
  We establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses ( Loss Reserves ) which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred. Estimating Loss Reserves is inherently difficult, which is exacerbated by the fact that we have relatively limited historical experience upon which to base such estimates. We utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of Loss Reserves. Actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  We have not included Watford Re in the following section as we do not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford Re, and our financial exposure to Watford Re is limited to our investment in Watford Re s common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from reinsurance transactions. 
  ACGL is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries. Generally, ACGL depends on its available cash resources, liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any dividends or liquidation amounts with respect to the non-cumulative preferred shares and common shares. ACGL s readily available cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, excluding amounts held by our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, totaled   $438.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , ACGL received dividends of   $142.0 million   from Arch Reinsurance Ltd. ( Arch Re Bermuda ), our Bermuda-based reinsurer and insurer. 
  The ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards. Under Bermuda law, Arch Re Bermuda is required to maintain statutory capital (i.e., the amount by which the value of its statutory assets exceed its statutory liabilities) equal to or in excess of its minimum solvency margin equal to the greatest of (1) $100.0 million, (2) 50% of net premiums written (being gross premiums written less any premiums ceded by Arch Re Bermuda, but Arch Re Bermuda may not deduct more than 25% of gross premiums when computing net premiums written), (3) 15% of net aggregated losses and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves and (4) 25% of its enhanced capital requirement ( ECR ) as reported at the end of the relevant year. Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is not in  

compliance with its ECR, minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. In addition, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet) unless it files, at least seven days before payment of such dividends, with the Bermuda Monetary Authority ( BMA ) an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins. In addition, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited, without prior approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital, as set out in its previous year s statutory financial statements. As a Class 4 insurer, Arch Re Bermuda is required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus pertaining to its general business at a level equal to or in excess of its ECR which is established by reference to either the BSCR model ( BSCR ) or an approved internal capital model. At   December 31, 2015  , as determined under Bermuda law, Arch Re Bermuda had statutory capital of   $2.45 billion   ($2.40 billion at December 31, 2014) and statutory capital and surplus of   $5.43 billion   ($5.42 billion at December 31, 2014), which amounts were in compliance with Arch Re Bermuda s ECR at such date. Such amounts include ownership interests in U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, Arch Re Bermuda can pay approximately   $1.22 billion   to ACGL during the remainder of   2016   without providing an affidavit to the BMA, as discussed above. Under BMA guidelines, the value of the assets of our insurance group (i.e., the group of companies that conducts exclusively, or mainly, insurance business) must exceed the amount of the group s liabilities by the aggregate minimum margin of solvency of each qualifying member of the group (the  Group MSM ). A member is a qualifying member of the insurance group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. We were in compliance with the Group MSM at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Our U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The ability of our regulated insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards. These regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends or other distributions, such as loans or cash advances, available to shareholders without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. Dividends or distributions, if any, made by Arch Re U.S. would result in an increase in available capital at Arch Capital Group (U.S.) Inc. ( Arch-U.S. ), a subsidiary of ACGL. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Arch-U.S. received dividends of $25 million from Arch Re U.S. Arch Re U.S. can declare a maximum of approximately $95 million of dividends during the remainder of   2016   subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Insurance ( Commissioner ). In addition, with respect to dividends in excess of the $95 million (extraordinary dividend), no payment can be made until (1) 30 days after the Commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such  

Table of Contents  

payment; or (2) the Commissioner shall have approved the payment within the 30-day period. Delaware insurance laws also require that the statutory surplus of Arch Re U.S. following any dividend or distribution be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. 
  In April 2015, the GSEs published comprehensive, revised requirements, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements or  PMIERs.  The PMIERs became effective   December 31, 2015   and apply to Arch MI U.S., which is a GSE-approved mortgage insurer. They do not apply to Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, which insures mortgages that are not intended to be sold to the GSEs, and it is therefore not approved by either GSE as an eligible mortgage insurer. In addition to extensive requirements relating to the operation of our mortgage insurance business, the PMIERs include revised financial requirements for mortgage insurers. No later than March 1, 2016, mortgage insurers were required to certify to the GSEs that they meet all of the requirements of the PMIERs or identify specific requirements that they do not meet. If a mortgage insurer is unable to meet the financial requirements of the PMIERs, it was required to submit by March 31, 2016 a transition plan to the GSEs for their review and approval. Mortgage insurers that have not met the financial requirements of the PMIERs by June 30, 2017 will be subject to remediation actions by the GSEs.  
  The amount of assets required to satisfy the revised financial requirements of the PMIERs at any point in time will be affected by many factors, including macro-economic conditions, the size and composition of Arch MI U.S. s mortgage insurance portfolio at the point in time, and the amount of risk ceded to reinsurers that may be deducted by Arch MI U.S. in its calculation of  minimum required assets.  Arch MI U.S. satisfied the PMIERs  financial requirements as of   September 30, 2016  . Under the PMIERs, Arch MI U.S. is deemed to be a  newly-approved insurer.  As a result of this status, until January 2017, Arch MI U.S. is subject to additional PMIER requirements, including that Arch MI U.S. is prohibited from paying dividends to affiliates or making any investment, contribution or loan to any affiliate. 
  In addition to meeting applicable regulatory standards, the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to intermediate parent companies owned by Arch Re Bermuda is also constrained by our dependence on the financial strength ratings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries from independent rating agencies. The ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. We believe that ACGL has sufficient cash resources and available dividend capacity to service its indebtedness and other current outstanding obligations. 
  Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain assets on deposit, which primarily consist of fixed maturities, with various regulatory authorities to support their  

operations. The assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities to third parties. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain assets in trust accounts as collateral for insurance and reinsurance transactions with affiliated companies and also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , such amounts approximated   $5.65 billion   and   $5.20 billion  , respectively, excluding amounts related to the  other  segment. 
  Our non-U.S. operations account for a significant percentage of our net premiums written. In general, the business written by our non-U.S. operations, which is heavily weighted towards reinsurance business, has been more profitable than the business written in our U.S. operations, which is weighted more towards insurance business. In general, our reinsurance segment has operated at a higher margin than our insurance segment, which is due to prevailing market conditions and the mix and type of business written. Historically, the most profitable line of business has been catastrophe-exposed property reinsurance, which is written primarily in our non-U.S. operations. Additionally, a significant component of our pre-tax income is generated through our investment performance. We hold a substantial amount of our investable assets in our non-U.S. operations and, accordingly, a large portion of our investment income is produced in our non-U.S. operations. In addition, ACGL, through its subsidiaries, provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates, through certain reinsurance arrangements beneficial to the ratings of such subsidiaries. Our U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance groups enter into separate reinsurance arrangements with Arch Re Bermuda covering individual lines of business. For the 2015 calendar year, the U.S. groups ceded business to Arch Re Bermuda at an aggregate net cession rate (  i.e.  , net of third party reinsurance) of approximately 53%, compared to 53% for 2014. All of the above factors have resulted in the non-U.S. group providing a higher contribution to our overall pre-tax income in the current period than the percentage of net premiums written would indicate. 
  Except as described in the above paragraph, or where express reinsurance, guarantee or other financial support contractual arrangements are in place, each of ACGL s subsidiaries or affiliates is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments (and no other ACGL subsidiary or affiliate is so responsible). Any reinsurance arrangements, guarantees or other financial support contractual arrangements that are in place are solely for the benefit of the ACGL subsidiary or affiliate involved and third parties (creditors or insureds of such entity) are not express beneficiaries of such arrangements.

The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, excluding amounts related to the  other  segment (  i.e.  , Watford Re). See Note   3  ,  Variable Interest Entities,  for cash flows related to Watford Re. 

Cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was higher than in the   2015   period, primarily reflecting a higher level of premiums collected. The   2015   period also reflected a higher level of outflows related to the Company s mortgage operations. 
     Cash used for investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was higher than in the   2015   period. Activity for the   2016   period reflected higher net purchases of investments than in the   2015   period, reflecting the investment of operating cash flows and proceeds from our preferred share offering. Cash flows also reflect a lower level of repurchases under our share repurchase program in the   2016   period than in the 2015 period. 
     Cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was higher than in the   2015   period, primarily reflecting the issuance of preferred shares in September 2016 ($434.9 million of net proceeds) and a lower level of repurchases under our share repurchase program in the   2016   period. We repurchased   $75.3 million   of our common shares in the   2016   period, compared to   $365.4 million   in the   2015   period.  
  Our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time losses are paid. The period of time from the occurrence of a claim through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future. Sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, financing arrangements or routine sales of investments. 
  As part of our investment strategy, we seek to establish a level of cash and highly liquid short-term and intermediate-term securities which, combined with expected cash flow, is believed by us to be adequate to meet our foreseeable payment obligations. However, due to the nature of our operations, cash flows are affected by claim payments that may comprise large payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate from year to year. We believe that our liquid investments and cash flow will provide us with sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claim payment obligations. However, the timing and amounts of actual claim  

payments related to recorded Loss Reserves vary based on many factors, including large individual losses, changes in the legal environment, as well as general market conditions. The ultimate amount of the claim payments could differ materially from our estimated amounts. Certain lines of business written by us, such as excess casualty, have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. The foregoing may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns. The impact of this variability can be exacerbated by the fact that the timing of the receipt of reinsurance recoverables owed to us may be slower than anticipated by us. Therefore, the irregular timing of claim payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods and may require us to utilize other sources of liquidity to make these payments, which may include the sale of investments or utilization of existing or new credit facilities or capital market transactions. If the source of liquidity is the sale of investments, we may be forced to sell such investments at a loss, which may be material. 
  Our investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income and structured securities, investments in funds accounted for using the equity method, other alternative investments and investments in ventures such as Watford Re and others may be illiquid due to contractual provisions or investment market conditions. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, then we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or may be forced to sell or terminate them at unfavorable values. Our unfunded investment commitments totaled approximately   $1.34 billion   at   September 30, 2016   . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our investable assets were   $16.04 billion   (excluding the   $1.84 billion   of investable assets related to the  other  segment). The primary goals of our asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities, manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows, including debt service obligations. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by our fixed income portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of our insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial degree by which the fair value of the fixed income portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, provide assurance of our ability to fund the payment of claims and to service our outstanding debt without having to sell securities at distressed prices or access credit facilities. 
  Changes in general economic conditions, including new or continued sovereign debt concerns in Eurozone countries or downgrades of U.S. securities by credit rating agencies, could have a material adverse effect on financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world.

In turn, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in particular, this could have a material adverse effect on the value and liquidity of securities in our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   included   $211.8 million   of securities issued and/or guaranteed by Eurozone governments at fair value,   $3.01 billion   of obligations of the U.S. government and government agencies at fair value and   $1.89 billion   of municipal bonds at fair value.

  On August 15, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with AIG pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, ACGL agreed to purchase from AIG all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of UGC. As consideration in the UGC Acquisition, ACGL will pay to AIG aggregate consideration of approximately   $3.43 billion   (using the ACGL closing share price as of   October 27, 2016  ), consisting of the following: (i) cash consideration of approximately   $2.20 billion  ; (ii) a number of shares of ACGL s convertible non-voting common-equivalent preference shares which are subject to a formula and a collar and an estimated fair value (using the ACGL closing share price as of   October 27, 2016   of   $77.03   per share) of approximately   $983.1 million  , subject to adjustment and subject to certain restrictions on transfer within the first 18 months; and (iii) an additional amount (or if such amount is negative $0) in cash equal to   $250.0 million   less the Company Dividend Amount (as defined below), if any, less the value of Perpetual Preferred Shares (as defined below) issued to AIG, if any. The Stock Purchase Agreement entitles AIG to take dividends or other distributions from UGC in an amount not to exceed   $250.0 million   between the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the closing date of the UGC Acquisition. If such event does not occur, ACGL will pay an additional amount in cash equal to $250 million, less the value of certain depositary shares issued to AIG, if any.  
  The closing of the UGC Acquisition is targeted to occur late in the 2016 fourth quarter. The Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including: (i) the parties  mutual agreement; (ii) by either ACGL or AIG, if the closing has not occurred on or before March 31, 2017, subject to an extension at the request of either party of up to three months for the receipt of certain approvals (such date, as may be extended, the  Outside Date  (iii) by either ACGL or AIG, in the event of the issuance of a final, non-appealable governmental order restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement or in the event that any law has been enacted, promulgated or issued by any governmental authority that restrains, enjoins or prohibits the transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement or that would render the consummation of such transaction illegal; or (iv) the non-terminating party s material uncured breach of the Stock Purchase Agreement. In the event that either ACGL or  

AIG terminates the Stock Purchase Agreement due to a failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on or before the Outside Date and specified ACGL conditions to closing are otherwise satisfied, ACGL will pay a termination fee of   $150.0 million   to AIG. 
  On September 29, 2016, ACGL completed a   $450.0 million   underwritten public offering of   18.0 million   depositary shares (the  Depositary Shares ), each of which represents a 1/1,000th interest in a share of its   5.25%   Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series E, have a   $0.01   par value and   $25,000   liquidation preference per share (equivalent to   $25   liquidation preference per Depositary Share) (the  Series E Preferred Shares ). Each Depositary Share, evidenced by a depositary receipt, entitles the holder, through the depositary, to a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences of the Series E Preferred Shares represented thereby (including any dividend, liquidation, redemption and voting rights). Except in specified circumstances relating to certain tax or corporate events, the Series E Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to September 29, 2021. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of $434.9 million to fund a portion of the UGC Acquisition, to pay related costs and expenses and for general corporate purposes. 
  On October 26, 2016, ACGL and certain of its subsidiaries amended the existing Credit Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $350.0 million secured facility for letters of credit and $500.0 million unsecured facility for revolving loans and letters of credit.  Obligations of each borrower under the secured facility for letters of credit are secured by cash and eligible securities of such borrower held in collateral accounts. ACGL has a one-time option to convert any or all outstanding revolving loans of ACGL and/or Arch-U.S. to term loans with the same terms as the revolving loans except that any prepayments may not be reborrowed. Arch-U.S. guarantees the obligations of ACGL, and ACGL guarantees the obligations of Arch-U.S.  
  Commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement will expire on October 26, 2021, and all loans then outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement must be repaid. Letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement will not have an expiration date later than October 26, 2022. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, conditions to credit extensions, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. 
  In connection with the UGC Acquisition, we entered into the Bridge Credit Agreement, which provides for commitments by the lenders thereunder to provide up to   $1.375 billion   of term loans (the  Bridge Loans ) to fund a portion of the cash consideration portion required in the UGC Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The Bridge Loans, if funded, will mature on the date that is 364 days after funding. 
  The Bridge Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require ACGL to maintain a minimum consolidated  

Table of Contents  

tangible net worth and a maximum ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth. The Bridge Credit Agreement also includes customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. These provisions are generally consistent with those in ACGL s existing revolving credit agreement. 
  Arch-U.S. will provide a guaranty of the obligations under the Bridge Credit Agreement. ACGL has the ability under the Bridge Loan Agreement to designate one of its subsidiaries to be the borrower pursuant to the terms thereof. In such case, ACGL would guarantee the obligations of the subsidiary borrower. 
  Commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement (or, to the extent funded, Bridge Loans) will be subject to mandatory reduction (or, in the case of Bridge Loans, mandatory prepayment), by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurrences, equity issuances and asset sales. The outstanding commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement were   $938.5 million   at September 30, 2016, reflecting the preferred offering discussed above.  
  To provide funding for the   $2.20 billion   cash consideration portion of the UGC Acquisition, we expect to sell certain investments, use the net proceeds from the September 2016 preferred share offering and utilize the unsecured revolving loan facility under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, we anticipate that we raise additional capital before closing, further reducing the need to use the Bridge Credit Agreement. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required funds through financing and may be required to utilize the Bridge Credit Agreement.  
  Pursuant to our January 2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance Company and its affiliated mortgage insurance companies (the  CMG Entities ), we are required to make contingent consideration payments based on the closing book value of the pre-closing portfolio of the CMG Entities as re-calculated over an earn-out period and payable at the third, fifth and sixth anniversaries after closing (subject to a one time extension period of one to three years at the sellers  discretion). The maximum amount of contingent consideration payments is $136.9 million over the earn-out period (or 150% of the closing book value of the CMG Entities less amounts paid at closing). We currently expect that the maximum amount will be paid over the earn-out period and that the first payment, due in April 2017, will be approximately $70 million. To the extent that the adjusted book value of the CMG Entities drops below the cumulative amount paid by us, no additional payments would be due. 
  We expect that our liquidity needs, excluding the UGC Acquisition noted above, including our anticipated (re)insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs, for the next twelve months, at a minimum, will be met by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, as well as by our balance of cash, short-term investments, proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments, and our credit facilities. 

In addition, we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and will seek to adjust our capital base (up or down) according to the needs of our business. The future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. Our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. In particular, we require (1) sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings, as issued by several ratings agencies, at a level considered necessary by management to enable our key operating subsidiaries to compete; (2) sufficient capital to enable our underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the U.S. and other key markets; and (3) our non-U.S. operating companies are required to post letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are necessary for them to operate as they are  non-admitted  under U.S. state insurance regulations. 
  As part of our capital management program, we may seek to raise additional capital or may seek to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, cash dividends or other methods (or a combination of such methods). Any such determination will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits, financial requirements and other factors, including legal restrictions, rating agency requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. 
  The board of directors of ACGL has authorized the investment in ACGL s common shares through a share repurchase program. Since the inception of the share repurchase program through   September 30, 2016  , ACGL has repurchased   125.2 million   common shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $3.68 billion  . At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $446.5 million   of share repurchases were available under the program. Repurchases under this authorization may be effected from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of the repurchase transactions under this program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations. We will continue to monitor our share price and, depending upon results of operations, market conditions and the development of the economy, as well as other factors, we will consider share repurchases on an opportunistic basis. 
  To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth. We can provide no assurance that, if needed, we would be able to obtain additional funds through financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Adverse developments in the financial markets, such as disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets, may result in realized and unrealized capital losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial  

Table of Contents  

position and our businesses, and may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. 
  If we are not able to obtain adequate capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, which could include, among other things, the following possible outcomes: (1) potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our operating subsidiaries, which could place those operating subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher-rated competitors; (2) reductions in the amount of business that our operating subsidiaries are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy-based tests enforced by statutory agencies; and (3) any resultant ratings downgrades could, among other things, affect our ability to write business and increase the cost of bank credit and letters of credit. In addition, under certain of the reinsurance agreements assumed by our reinsurance operations, upon the occurrence of a ratings downgrade or other specified triggering event with respect to our reinsurance operations, such as a reduction in surplus by specified amounts during specified periods, our ceding company clients may be provided with certain rights, including, among other things, the right to terminate the subject reinsurance agreement and/or to require that our reinsurance operations post additional collateral. 
  In addition to common share capital, we depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities, which can be in the form (or any combination) of debt securities, preference shares, common equity and bank credit facilities providing loans and/or letters of credit. As noted above, equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and, in any case, such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities. 
  In March 2015, ACGL and Arch-U.S. filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC. This registration statement allows for the possible future offer and sale by us of various types of securities, including unsecured debt securities, preference shares, common shares, warrants, share purchase contracts and units and depositary shares. The shelf registration statement enables us to efficiently access the public debt and/or equity capital markets in order to meet our future capital needs. The shelf registration statement also allows selling shareholders to resell common shares that they own in one or more offerings from time to time. We will not receive any proceeds from any shares offered by the selling shareholders. This report is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , total capital available to Arch of   $8.24 billion   consisted of   $791.4 million   of senior notes, representing   9.6%   of the total,   $100.0 million   of revolving  

credit agreement borrowings due in June 2019, representing   1.2%   of the total,   $775.0 million   of preferred shares, representing   9.4%   of the total, and common shareholders  equity of   $6.58 billion  , representing   79.8%   of the total. At   December 31, 2015  , total capital available to Arch of   $7.10 billion   consisted of   $791.3 million   of senior notes, representing   11.2%   of the total,   $100.0 million   of revolving credit agreement borrowings, representing   1.4%   of the total,   $325.0 million   of preferred shares, representing   4.6%   of the total, and common shareholders  equity of   $5.88 billion  , representing   82.9%   of the total.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our   2015   Form 10-K, as updated in  Liquidity and Capital Resources  to reflect our Amended Credit Agreement and the UGC Acquisition and related Bridge Loan Facility. 
  Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management 
  In accordance with the SEC s Financial Reporting Release No. 48, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016  . Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and is comprised of several components, including liquidity, basis and price risks. We have not included Watford Re in the following analyses as we do not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford Re, and our financial exposure to Watford Re is limited to our investment in Watford Re s common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from reinsurance transactions.  
  An analysis of material changes in market risk exposures at   September 30, 2016   that affect the quantitative and qualitative disclosures presented in our   2015   Form 10-K (see section captioned  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management ) were as follows:  
  Investment Market Risk 
             
    Fixed Income Securities 
     We invest in interest rate sensitive securities, primarily debt securities. We consider the effect of interest rate movements on the fair value of our fixed maturities, fixed maturities pledged under securities lending agreements, short-term investments and certain of our other investments which invest in fixed income securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation. As interest rates rise, the fair value of our interest rate sensitive securities falls, and the converse is also true. Based on historical observations, there is a low probability that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time. Accordingly, the actual  

Table of Contents  

effect of interest rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth in the following tables. 
  The following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our fixed income securities: 

In addition, we consider the effect of credit spread movements on the fair value of our fixed maturities, fixed maturities pledged under securities lending agreements, short-term investments and certain of our other investments and investment funds accounted for using the equity method which invest in fixed income securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation. As credit spreads widen, the fair value of our fixed income securities falls, and the converse is also true. 
  The following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in credit spreads in a static interest rate environment would have had on our fixed income securities: 

Another method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is Value-at-Risk ( VaR ). VaR attempts to take into account a broad cross-section of risks facing a portfolio by utilizing relevant securities volatility data skewed towards the most recent months and quarters. VaR measures the amount of a portfolio at risk for outcomes 1.65 standard deviations from the mean based on normal market conditions over a one year time horizon and is expressed as a percentage of the portfolio s initial value. In other words, 95% of the time, should the risks taken into account in the VaR model perform per their historical tendencies, the portfolio s loss in any one year period is expected to be less than or equal to the  

calculated VaR, stated as a percentage of the measured portfolio s initial value. As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio s VaR was estimated to be   3.34%  , or   $500.0 million  , compared to an estimated   3.01%  , or   $408.5 million  , at   December 31, 2015  . 
             
    Certain Other Investments and Equity Securities 
     Our investment portfolio includes certain other investments which do not invest in fixed income securities along with equity holdings. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of such investments totaled   $560.9 million   and   $630.0 million  , respectively. These investments are exposed to price risk, which is the potential loss arising from decreases in fair value. An immediate hypothetical 10% decline in the value of each position would reduce the fair value of such investments by approximately   $56.1 million   and   $63.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and would have decreased book value per common share by approximately   $0.46   and   $0.51  , respectively. An immediate hypothetical 10% increase in the value of each position would increase the fair value of such investments by approximately   $56.1 million   and   $63.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and would have increased book value per common share by approximately   $0.46   and   $0.51  , respectively. 
             
    Investment-Related Derivatives 
     At   September 30, 2016  , the notional value of all derivative instruments (excluding to-be-announced mortgage backed securities which are included in the fixed income securities analysis above and foreign currency forward contracts which are included in the foreign currency exchange risk analysis below) was   $2.29 billion  , compared to   $2.81 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at   September 30, 2016   depreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in a reduction in net income of approximately   $22.9 million  , and a decrease in book value per common share of approximately   $0.19   per share, compared to   $28.1 million   and   $0.23   per share, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at   December 31, 2015  . If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at   September 30, 2016   appreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in an increase in net income of approximately   $22.9 million  , and an increase in book value per common share of approximately   $0.19   per share, compared to   $28.1 million   and   $0.23   per share, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at   December 31, 2015  . See note   8  ,  Derivative Instruments,  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures concerning derivatives.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  Foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Through our subsidiaries and branches located in various foreign countries, we conduct our insurance and reinsurance operations in a variety of local currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We generally hold investments in foreign currencies which are intended to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities. We may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts and currency options as part of our investment strategy. See note   8  ,  Derivative Instruments,  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  The following table provides a summary of our net foreign currency exchange exposures, as well as foreign currency derivatives in place to manage these exposures: 

(1) 
    Represents capital contributions held in the foreign currencies of our operating units. 
              (2) 
    Represents the net notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. 

Although the Company generally attempts to match the currency of its projected liabilities with investments in the same currencies, from time to time the Company may elect to over or underweight one or more currencies, which could increase the Company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and increase the volatility of the Company s shareholders  equity. Historical observations indicate a low probability that all foreign currency exchange rates would shift against the U.S. Dollar in the same direction and at the same time and, accordingly, the actual effect of foreign currency rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth above. For further discussion on foreign exchange activity, please refer to   Results of Operations.  
  Other Financial Information 
  The consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   have been reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the registrant's independent public accountants, whose report is included as an exhibit to this filing. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP states that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that unaudited financial information. Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for their report on the unaudited financial information because that report is not a "report" or a "part" of the registration statement prepared or certified by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
  Reference is made to the information appearing above under the subheading  Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management  under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to applicable Exchange Act  

Table of Contents  

Rules as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of and during the period covered by this report with respect to information being recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and with respect to timely communication to them and other members of management responsible for preparing periodic reports of all material information required to be disclosed in this report as it relates to ACGL and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  We continue to enhance our operating procedures and internal controls to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As a result of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
  We, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation and arbitration in the normal course of our business. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not a party to any litigation or arbitration which is expected by management to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and liquidity. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  
  Our business is subject to a number of risks, including those identified in Item 1A. of Part I of our 2015 Form 10-K, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity and that could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period. The risks described in our 2015 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. 
  Risks Relating to Our Company 
  Recent developments relating to the United Kingdom s referendum vote in favor of leaving the European Union could adversely affect us  . 
  On June 23, 2016, a referendum was held in the U.K. in which it was decided that the U.K. would leave the EU ( Brexit ). As a result of this vote, negotiations are expected to commence to determine the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal from the EU, including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the EU. The effects of Brexit have been, and are expected to continue to be, far reaching. The perceptions as to the impact of Brexit may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in Europe and globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain and will depend on any agreements the U.K. may make to retain access to EU markets. Lastly, as a result of the Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the EU. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain. 
  The proposed UGC Acquisition, as well as any future acquisitions, growth of our operations through the addition of new lines of insurance or reinsurance business through our existing subsidiaries or through the formation of new subsidiaries, expansion into new geographic regions and/or joint ventures or partnerships may expose us to risks. 
  We may in the future make acquisitions either of other companies or selected blocks of business, expand our business lines or enter into joint ventures. The proposed UGC Acquisition, as well as any future acquisitions, may expose us to challenges and risks, including: integrating financial and operational reporting systems and establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls; funding increased capital needs, overhead expenses or cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated sales and revenues are not realized or are delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties; obtaining management personnel required for expanded operations; obtaining necessary regulatory permissions; the value of assets acquired may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates and liabilities assumed may be greater than expected; the assets and liabilities we may acquire may be subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation; and financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification, reinsurance and other obligations to us. 
  Our failure to manage successfully these operational challenges and risks may impact our results of operations. In addition, if the reserves established by us, as they relate to any acquired book of business, prove to be inadequate, then subject to whatever recourse we may have against the seller or reinsurers, we may be responsible for adverse development in such reserves. 
  We may fail to realize the growth prospects and other benefits anticipated as a result of the UGC Acquisition. 
  The success of the UGC Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from acquiring United Guaranty. We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects. Integrating United Guaranty will require significant efforts and expenditures. Our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures and the cost of integration may exceed our expectations.  

Table of Contents  

We may also be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, improve or sustain the acquired operations or take writeoffs or impairment charges and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to United Guaranty. We might experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business, and we might not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities. It is possible that, following the closing of the UGC Acquisition, we may determine to reduce certain types of businesses that United Guaranty currently writes, which may result in lower revenues for the combined Arch MI U.S. and United Guaranty businesses following the UGC Acquisition. If any of these factors limit our ability to integrate United Guaranty successfully or on a timely basis, the expectations of future results of operations following the UGC Acquisition might not be met. 
  In addition, Arch MI U.S. and United Guaranty have operated and, until the completion of the UGC Acquisition, will continue to operate separately. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the UGC Acquisition and could harm our financial performance. 
  We will incur significant transaction and acquisition related integration costs in connection with the UGC Acquisition. 
  We are currently developing a plan to integrate United Guaranty after the completion of the UGC Acquisition. Although we anticipate achieving synergies in connection with the UGC Acquisition, we also expect to incur costs to implement such cost savings measures. We cannot identify the timing, nature and amount of all such charges as of the date of this filing. The significant transaction costs and acquisition-related integration costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of United Guaranty, will offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. We have identified some, but not all, of the actions necessary to achieve our anticipated cost and operational savings. Accordingly, the cost and operational savings may not be achievable in our anticipated amount or time frame or at all. Investors should not place undue reliance on the anticipated benefits of the UGC Acquisition in making their investment decision. 
  We will be subject to business uncertainties while the UGC Acquisition is pending that could adversely affect our current and anticipated business. 
  Uncertainty about the effect of the UGC Acquisition on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. Although we intend to take actions to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our and their ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the UGC Acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter. These uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee retention could be reduced while the UGC Acquisition is pending, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If, despite our retention efforts, key employees depart because of concerns relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of the integration process or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be harmed. 
  If we are unable to continue to implement our U.S. mortgage insurance growth strategy through the UGC Acquisition or otherwise, our financial results could be adversely affected. 
  On January 30, 2014, our U.S.-based subsidiaries completed the acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance Company (renamed Arch MI U.S.). Prior to the acquisition, CMG Mortgage Insurance Company had been a GSE-approved mortgage insurance company limited to only credit union customers. Our growth strategy, which we are now in the third year of implementing, is to broaden Arch MI U.S. s customer base to national and regional banks and other mortgage lenders, while maintaining and increasing Arch MI U.S. s share of the mortgage insurance credit union market. The failure to consummate the UGC Acquisition may adversely affect our ability to implement our growth strategy in the mortgage insurance industry. The ultimate success of our strategy will depend upon, among other factors, our ability to: continue to maintain and develop business relationships with national and regional banks and other mortgage lenders, particularly the large lenders that originate a significant majority of low down payment mortgages in the U.S., and obtain their approvals as an authorized mortgage insurance provider; continue to develop and implement necessary e commerce connectivity with new customers  mortgage origination systems; maintain and expand business relationships with existing credit union customers; and retain and attract a capable workforce at Arch MI U.S. necessary to implement our U.S. mortgage insurance strategy. 
  Because of these factors, economic conditions and competitive dynamics, the extent to which we will be successful implementing our U.S. mortgage insurance strategy is uncertain. If we are unable to continue to attract new, and retain existing, customers and process business efficiently and reliably, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We cannot assure you that the proposed UGC Acquisition will be completed. Failure to close the UGC Acquisition could adversely affect us. 
  There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the UGC Acquisition. For example, the UGC Acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed in the time frame, on the terms or in the manner currently anticipated. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the UGC Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the UGC Acquisition. Our ability to consummate the UGC Acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In the event that the UGC Acquisition does not occur because of an inability to obtain required regulatory approvals, under certain circumstances we will be required under the Stock Purchase Agreement to pay AIG a termination fee equal to $150 million. 
  The UGC Acquisition is subject to receipt of consent or approval from governmental authorities that could delay or prevent the completion of the UGC Acquisition or that could cause the abandonment of the UGC Acquisition. 
  To complete the UGC Acquisition, we need to obtain approvals or consents from, and make filings with, certain applicable governmental authorities. While we believe that we will receive all required approvals for the UGC Acquisition, there can be no assurance as to the receipt or timing of receipt of these approvals. A substantial delay in obtaining any required authorizations, approvals or consents, or the imposition of unfavorable terms, conditions or restrictions contained in such authorizations, approvals or consents, could prevent the completion of the UGC Acquisition or have an adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of the UGC Acquisition, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
  The proposed UGC Acquisition may expose us to unknown liabilities. 
  Because we have agreed to acquire all the outstanding equity interests of United Guaranty, our acquisition will generally be subject to all of United Guaranty s liabilities. If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, including contingent liabilities, our business could be materially affected. We may learn additional information about United Guaranty that adversely affects us, such as unknown liabilities, issues that could affect our ability to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws. 

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
  The following table summarizes our purchases of our common shares for the   2016 third quarter  :   

           (1) 
    Represents repurchases by ACGL of shares, from time to time, from employees in order to facilitate the payment of withholding taxes on restricted shares granted and the exercise of stock appreciation rights. We purchased these shares at their fair value, as determined by reference to the closing price of our common shares on the day the restricted shares vested or the stock appreciation rights were exercised. 
              (2) 
    Remaining amount available at   September 30, 2016   under ACGL s share repurchase authorization, under which repurchases may be effected from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2019.  

ITEM 5.  OTHER INFORMATION   
  In accordance with Section 10a(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are responsible for disclosing non-audit services to be provided by our independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which are approved by the Audit Committee of our board of directors. During the   2016 third quarter  , the Audit Committee approved engagements of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for permitted non-audit services, which consisted of tax consulting services, tax compliance services and other accounting consulting services.

Disclosure of Certain Activities Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
    
  Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or an affiliate knowingly engaged in certain activities described in that section, including certain activities related to Iran during the period covered by the report.  
  Effective January 16, 2016, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury adopted General License H which authorizes non-U.S. entities that are owned or controlled by a U.S. person to engage in certain activities with Iran so long as they comply with certain specific requirements set forth therein.   
  Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries provide global marine policies that provide coverage for vessels navigating into and out of ports worldwide. In light of European Union and U.S. modifications to Iran sanctions this year, including the issuance of General License H, and consistent with General License H, we have been notified that certain of our policyholders have begun to, or will begin to, ship cargo to and from Iran, and that such cargo may include transporting crude oil from Iran to another country. Since these policies insure multiple voyages and fleets containing multiple ships, we are unable to attribute gross revenues and net profits from such marine policies to these activities involving Iran. We intend for our non-U.S. subsidiaries to continue to provide such coverage to the extent permitted by applicable law.
