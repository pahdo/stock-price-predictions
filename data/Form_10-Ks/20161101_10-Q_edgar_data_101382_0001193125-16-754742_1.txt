    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)   
  1. Financial Statement Presentation     The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UMB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) after elimination of all intercompany transactions. In the opinion of management of the Company, all adjustments
relating to items that are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations have been made. The results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented may not be
indicative of the results of the full year. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  within this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q (the Form 10-Q) and in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 25, 2016 (the Form 10-K).  
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
 The Company is a financial holding company, which offers a wide range of banking and other financial services to its customers through its
branches and offices in Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Indiana, Utah, Minnesota, California, and Wisconsin. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also impact reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A summary of the significant accounting policies to
assist the reader in understanding the financial presentation is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Form 10-K.     Cash and
cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents include Cash and due from banks and amounts due from the Federal Reserve Bank. Cash on
hand, cash items in the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks are included in Cash and due from banks. Amounts due from the Federal Reserve Bank are interest-bearing for all periods presented and are included in the
Interest-bearing due from banks line on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.    This table provides a summary of cash and cash
equivalents as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  (in thousands) :      
   Also included in the Interest-bearing due from banks, but not considered cash and cash equivalents, are
interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions, which totaled $96.8 million and $155.9 million at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  
  Per Share Data     Basic net income per
share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted quarter-to-date net income per share includes the dilutive effect of 435,029 and 459,050 shares issuable upon the exercise of
options granted by the Company and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Diluted year-to-date net income per share includes the dilutive effect of 369,781 and 460,581 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options
granted by the Company and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      (CONTINUED)      
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)   
   
  Options issued under employee benefits plans to purchase 394,863 shares of common stock were
outstanding at September 30, 2016, but were not included in the computation of quarter-to-date diluted EPS because the options were anti-dilutive. Options issued under employee benefits plans to purchase 628,698 shares of common stock were
outstanding at September 30, 2016, but were not included in the computation of year-to-date diluted EPS because the options were anti-dilutive. Options issued under employee benefits plans to purchase 461,905 shares of common stock were
outstanding at September 30, 2015, but were not included in the computation of quarter-to-date and year-to-date diluted EPS because the options were anti-dilutive.  
  3. New Accounting Pronouncements      Revenue Recognition
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The issuance is part of a joint effort by the FASB and the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to enhance financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and, thereby, improving the consistency of requirements,
comparability of practices and usefulness of disclosures. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective
date of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods that begin after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, which intends to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on
principal versus agent considerations within ASU No. 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation within ASU No. 2014-09.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU Nos. 2016-11 and 2016-12, which further clarify guidance and provide practical expedients related to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect
transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that these standards will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method.  
  Equity-Based Compensation  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award
Provide that a Performance Target could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  The amendment is intended to reduce diversity in practice by clarifying that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the
requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The amendments in this update were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement had no impact on the
Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.     Going Concern  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The amendment addresses management s responsibility in regularly evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a
going concern. The amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, although early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement
will not impact the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.     Derivatives and Hedging  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2014-16,  Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity.  The amendment is intended to address how current U.S. GAAP should be interpreted in
evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The amendments in this update were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement had no impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Consolidation  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  The amendment substantially
changes the way reporting entities are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the new amendment. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether
limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affect the consolidation analysis of
reporting entities that are involved with VIEs. The amendments in this update were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect
transition method. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement had no impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      (CONTINUED)      
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)   
   
   Financial Instruments  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendment is intended to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in this update are effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard requires the use of the cumulative effect transition method as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Except for certain provisions, early adoption is not permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact this will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.     Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases.  The amendment changes the accounting treatment of leases, in that lessees will recognize most leases on-balance sheet. This will increase reported assets and liabilities, as lessees will be required to
recognize a right-of-use asset along with a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis. Lessees are allowed to account for short-term leases (those with a term of twelve months or less) off-balance sheet. The amendments in this update are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact this will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.     Extinguishments of Liabilities  In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-04,  Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products.  The amendment is intended to reduce the diversity in practice related to the recognition of breakage. Breakage refers to the portion of a
prepaid stored-value product, such as a gift card, that goes unused wholly or partially for an indefinite period of time. This amendment requires that breakage be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance within ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard permits the use of either the
modified retrospective or full retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-04 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has not yet
selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. The Company will adopt ASU No. 2016-04 in conjunction with its adoption of ASU No. 2014-09.  
  Derivatives and Hedging  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting
Relationships.  The amendment is intended to clarify that the novation of a derivative contract that has been designated to be in a hedging relationship under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 815 does not, in and of itself,
represent a termination event for the derivative and does not require dedesignation of the hedging relationship. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The amendment permits the use of either a prospective or modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have no impact on the Company s Consolidated
Financial Statements.     Equity-Based Compensation  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting.  The amendment is part of the FASB s simplification initiative and is intended to simplify the accounting around share-based payment award transactions. The amendments include changing the recording of excess tax
benefits from being recognized as a part of surplus capital to being charged directly to the income statement, changing the classification of excess tax benefits within the statement of cash flows, and allowing companies to account for forfeitures
on an actual basis, as well as tax withholding changes. The amendment requires different transition methods for various components of the standard. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.    In September 2016, the Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-09 with
an effective date of January 1, 2016. As part of the adoption of this standard, the Company made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures on an actual basis and discontinue the use of an estimated forfeiture approach.
Additionally, the Company selected the retrospective transition method for the reclassification of the  Net tax benefit related to equity compensation plans  from the financing section to the operating section of the Company s
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The

impact to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income for adopting all provisions of the standard was an increase to net income of $158 thousand for the three-month period ended
March 31, 2016 and an increase to net income of $220 thousand for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $482 thousand as an increase to the opening balance of
total equity. Prior period financial statements as of and for the three-month and year-to-date periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 will be recast when presented in future filings.  
  Credit Losses  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  This update replaces the
current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a current expected credit loss model, which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience,
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This amendment broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimates. Additionally, the update amends the accounting for credit losses for
available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination. This update requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better
understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company s loan portfolio. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. The amendment requires the use of the modified retrospective approach for
adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.     Statement of Cash Flows  In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 ,   Classification of Certain Receipts and Cash Payments.  This amendment adds to and clarifies existing guidance regarding the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the
statement of cash flows with the intent of reducing diversity in practice with respect to eight types of cash flows. The amendments in this update require full retrospective adoption and are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this will have on its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.    
  4. Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses      Loan
Origination/Risk Management     The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to minimize the level
of risk within the loan portfolio. Diversification of the loan portfolio manages the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Authority levels are established for the extension of credit to ensure consistency throughout the Company.
It is necessary that policies, processes and practices implemented to control the risks of individual credit transactions and portfolio segments are sound and adhered to. The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and
validates the risk assessment on a continual basis. Management regularly evaluates the results of the loan reviews. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit
personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures.    Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding
the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Commercial loans are made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of the
borrower, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may
incorporate a personal guarantee. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts from its customers.
Commercial credit cards are generally unsecured and are underwritten with criteria similar to commercial loans including an analysis of the borrower s cash flow, available business capital, and overall credit-worthiness of the borrower.  
 Asset-based loans are offered primarily in the form of revolving lines of credit to commercial borrowers that do not generally qualify for
traditional bank financing. Asset-based loans are underwritten based primarily upon the value of the collateral pledged to secure the loan, rather than on the borrower s general financial condition. The Company utilizes pre-loan due diligence
techniques, monitoring disciplines, and loan management practices common within the asset-based lending industry to underwrite loans to these borrowers.

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)   
   
  Factoring loans provide working capital through the purchase and/or financing of accounts
receivable to borrowers in the transportation industry and to commercial borrowers that do not generally qualify for traditional bank financing.  
 Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of real
estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent
on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. The Company requires that an appraisal of the collateral be made at origination and on an as-needed basis, in conformity with
current market conditions and regulatory requirements. The underwriting standards address both owner and non-owner occupied real estate.  
 Construction loans are underwritten using feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis or absorption and lease
rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with
repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent
financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real
property, economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing.    Underwriting standards for residential real estate and home
equity loans are based on the borrower s loan-to-value percentage, collection remedies, and overall credit history.    Consumer loans
are underwritten based on the borrower s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer loans and leases and periodically reviews the distribution of FICO scores relative to historical periods to monitor credit
risk on its credit card loans. The underwriting and review practices combined with the relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Consumer loans and leases that are 90 days past due or more are
considered non-performing.    Credit risk is a potential loss resulting from nonpayment of either the primary or secondary exposure. Credit
risk is mitigated with formal risk management practices and a thorough initial credit-granting process including consistent underwriting standards and approval process. Control factors or techniques to minimize credit risk include knowing the
client, understanding total exposure, analyzing the client and debtor s financial capacity, and monitoring the client s activities. Credit risk and portions of the portfolio risk are managed through concentration considerations, average
risk ratings, and other aggregate characteristics.    The loan portfolio is comprised of loans originated by the Company and loans purchased
in connection with the Company s acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) on May 31, 2015 (the Acquisition Date). The purchased loans were recorded at estimated fair value at the Acquisition Date with no carryover of the
related allowance. The purchased loans were segregated between those considered to be performing, non-purchased credit impaired loans (Non-PCI), and those with evidence of credit deterioration, purchased credit impaired loans (PCI). Purchased loans
are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration and if it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected.  
 At the Acquisition Date, gross loans purchased from the Marquette acquisition had a fair value of $980.4 million split between Non-PCI loans
totaling $972.6 million and PCI loans totaling $7.8 million of loans. The gross contractually required principal and interest payments receivable for the Non-PCI loans and PCI loans totaled $983.9 million and $9.3 million, respectively.  
 The fair value estimates for purchased loans are based on expected prepayments and the amount and timing of discounted expected principal,
interest and other cash flows. Credit discounts representing the principal losses

expected over the life of the loan are also a component of the initial fair value. In determining the Acquisition Date fair value of PCI loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Company generally
aggregated purchased commercial, real estate, and consumer loans into pools of loans with common risk characteristics.    The difference
between the fair value of Non-PCI loans and contractual amounts due at the Acquisition Date is accreted into income over the estimated life of the loans. Contractual amounts due represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal
and interest payments.     Loans accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30   
 The excess of PCI loans  contractual amounts due over the amount of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the
non-accretable difference. The non-accretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, reflects estimated future credit losses and uncollectible contractual interest expected to be incurred
over the life of the PCI loans. The excess cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying amount of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the purchased loans
or pools using the level yield method. The accretable yield is affected by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans, changes in prepayment speed assumptions, and changes in expected principal and interest payments over the estimated
lives of the PCI loans.    Each quarter the Company evaluates the remaining contractual amounts due and estimates cash flows expected to be
collected over the life of the PCI loans. Contractual amounts due may increase or decrease for a variety of reasons, for example, when the contractual terms of the loan agreement are modified, when interest rates on variable rate loans change, or
when principal and/or interest payments are received. Cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans are estimated by incorporating several key assumptions similar to the initial estimate of fair value. These key assumptions include probability of
default, loss given default, and the amount of actual prepayments after the Acquisition Date. Prepayments affect the estimated lives of loans and could change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected. In
re-forecasting future estimated cash flows, credit loss expectations are adjusted as necessary. The adjustments are based, in part, on actual loss severities recognized for each loan type, as well as changes in the probability of default. For
periods in which estimated cash flows are not reforecasted, the prior reporting period s estimated cash flows are adjusted to reflect the actual cash received and credit events that transpired during the current reporting period.  
 Increases in expected cash flows of PCI loans subsequent to the Acquisition Date are recognized prospectively through adjustments of the yield
on the loans or pools over their remaining lives, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a provision for loan losses and an increase in the allowance.  
 The PCI loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 310-30,  Loans and Debt Securities Purchased with Deteriorated Credit
Quality . At September 30, 2016, the net recorded carrying amount of loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 was $1.0 million and the contractual amount due was $1.2 million.

  The Company sold residential real estate loans with proceeds of $61.7 million and $79.7
million in the secondary market without recourse during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  
 The Company has ceased the recognition of interest on loans with a carrying value of $79.6 million and $61.2 million at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Restructured loans totaled $54.4 million and $36.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest amounted to $2.7
million and $7.3 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There was an insignificant amount of interest recognized on impaired loans during 2016 and 2015.  
  Credit Quality Indicators     As part of the
on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to the risk grading of specified classes of loans, net charge-offs, non-performing loans,
and general economic conditions.    The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a rating to each of its commercial, commercial real
estate, and construction real estate loans. The loan rankings are summarized into the following categories: Non-watch list, Watch, Special Mention, and Substandard. Any loan not classified in one of the categories described below is considered to be
a Non-watch list loan. A description of the general characteristics of the loan ranking categories is as follows:      

Watch    This rating represents credit exposure that presents higher than average risk and warrants greater than routine attention by Company personnel due to conditions affecting the borrower, the
borrower s industry or the economic environment. These conditions have resulted in some degree of uncertainty that results in higher than average credit risk.    

Special Mention    This rating reflects a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment
prospects for the asset or the borrower s credit position at some future date. The rating is not adversely classified and does not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.    

Substandard    This rating represents an asset inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a
well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loans in this category are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential,
while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. This category may include loans where the collection of full principal is doubtful or remote.    
 All other classes of loans are generally evaluated and monitored based on payment activity. Non-performing loans include restructured loans on
non-accrual and all other non-accrual loans.

    Allowance for Loan Losses   
 The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents
management s judgment of inherent probable losses within the Company s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Accordingly, the
methodology is based on historical loss trends. The Company s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses
reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of, and trends related to, non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, criticized loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.  
 The level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss
experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and estimated losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific loans; however, the entire
allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available at the time, the adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors
beyond the Company s control, including, among other things, the performance of the Company s loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and changes in the regulatory environment.  
 The Company s allowance for loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances based on historical
loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company.  
 The allowances established for probable losses on specific loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of impaired loans. Loans are
classified based on an internal risk grading process that evaluates the obligor s ability to repay, the underlying collateral, if any, and the economic environment and industry in which the

borrower operates. When a loan is considered impaired, the loan is analyzed to determine the need, if any, to specifically allocate a portion of the allowance for loan losses to the loan.
Specific valuation allowances are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk ranking of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry.  
 General valuation allowances are calculated based on the historical loss experience of specific types of loans including an evaluation of the
time span and volume of the actual charge-off. The Company calculates historical loss ratios for pools of similar loans with similar characteristics based on the proportion of actual charge-offs experienced to the total population of loans in the
pool. The historical loss ratios are updated based on actual charge-off experience. A valuation allowance is established for each pool of similar loans based upon the product of the historical loss ratio, time span to charge-off, and the total
dollar amount of the loans in the pool. The Company s pools of similar loans include similarly risk-graded groups of commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial credit card, home equity loans, consumer real estate loans and
consumer and other loans. The Company also considers a loan migration analysis for criticized loans. This analysis includes an assessment of the probability that a loan will move to a loss position based on its risk rating. The consumer credit card
pool is evaluated based on delinquencies and credit scores. In addition, a portion of the allowance is determined by a review of qualitative factors by management.  
 Generally, the unsecured portion of a commercial or commercial real estate loan is charged off when, after analyzing the borrower s
financial condition, it is determined that the borrower is incapable of servicing the debt, little or no prospect for near term improvement exists, and no realistic and significant strengthening action is pending. For collateral dependent
commercial or commercial real estate loans, an analysis is completed regarding the Company s collateral position to determine if the amounts due from the borrower are in excess of the calculated current fair value of the
collateral. Specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for any collateral deficiency. If a collateral deficiency is ultimately deemed to be uncollectible, the amount is charged off. Revolving commercial loans (such
as commercial credit cards) which are past due 90 cumulative days are classified as a loss and charged off.    Generally, a consumer loan,
or a portion thereof, is charged off in accordance with regulatory guidelines which provide that such loans be charged off when the Company becomes aware of the loss, such as from a triggering event that may include, but is not limited to, new
information about a borrower s intent and ability to repay the loan, bankruptcy, fraud, or death. However, the charge-off timeframe should not exceed the specified delinquency time frames, which state that closed-end retail loans (such as
real estate mortgages, home equity loans and consumer installment loans) that become past due 120 cumulative days and open-end retail loans (such as home equity lines of credit and consumer credit cards) that become past due
180 cumulative days are classified as a loss and charged off.

   Troubled Debt Restructurings   
 A loan modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) when a concession has been granted to a debtor experiencing financial
difficulties. The Company s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the debtor short-term cash relief to allow them to improve
their financial condition. The Company s restructured loans are individually evaluated for impairment and evaluated as part of the allowance for loan loss as described above in the Allowance for Loan Losses section of this note.  
 Purchased loans restructured after acquisition are not considered or reported as troubled debt restructurings if the loans evidenced credit
deterioration as of the Acquisition Date and are accounted for in pools. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, no purchased loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings after the Acquisition Date.  
 The Company had $148 thousand and $217 thousand in commitments to lend to borrowers with loan modifications classified as TDRs as of
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company monitors loan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default. Determination of payment default involves analyzing the
economic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows during the loan term. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company had one commercial real estate loan classified as a TDR
with a payment default totaling $178 thousand. A specific valuation allowance for the full amount of this loan had previously been established within the Company s allowance for loan losses, and this loan was charged off against the allowance
for loan losses during that period.    This table provides a summary of loans restructured by class during the three and nine months ended

  The following table presents contractual maturity information for securities available for
sale at September 30, 2016  (in thousands):       
   Securities may be disposed of before contractual maturities due to sales by the Company or because borrowers
may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.    For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, proceeds from the sales of securities available for sale were $951.3 million compared to $782.8 million for the same period in 2015. Securities transactions resulted in gross realized gains of $8.5 million and $8.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gross realized losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1 thousand and $48 thousand, respectively.  
 Securities available for sale with a market value of $5.1 billion at September 30, 2016 and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2015 were
pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements. Of this amount, securities with a market value of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2016 and $1.6 billion
at December 31, 2015 were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of those dates.    The following

The unrealized losses in the Company s investments in U.S. treasury obligations, U.S. government
agencies, Government Sponsored Entity (GSE) mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, and corporates were caused by changes in interest rates. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more

   7. Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase   
 The Company utilizes repurchase agreements to facilitate the needs of customers and to facilitate secured short-term funding needs. Repurchase
agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Company monitors collateral levels on a continuous basis and may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying
securities. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with the Company s safekeeping agents.    The

    8. Business Segment Reporting   
 The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable segments (collectively, the Business
Segments): Bank, Institutional Investment Management, and Asset Servicing. Senior executive officers regularly evaluate business segment financial results produced by the Company s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate
resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. Previously, the Company had the following four Business Segments: Bank, Institutional Investment Management, Asset Servicing, and Payment Solutions. In the first
quarter of 2016, the Company merged the Payments Solutions segment into the Bank segment to better reflect how the core businesses, products and services are being evaluated by management currently. The Company s Payment Solutions
leadership structure and financial performance assessments are now included in the Bank segment, and accordingly, the reportable segments were realigned to reflect these changes. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on
methodologies in effect at September 30, 2016. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this filing to conform to the current organizational structure. 
 The following summaries provide information about the activities of each segment:  
 The  Bank  provides a full range of banking services to commercial, retail, government and correspondent bank customers through the
Company s branches, call center, internet banking, and ATM network. Services include traditional commercial and consumer banking, treasury management, leasing, foreign exchange, consumer and commercial credit and debit card, prepaid debit card
solutions, healthcare services, institutional cash management, merchant bankcard, wealth management, brokerage, insurance, capital markets, investment banking, corporate trust, and correspondent banking.  
  Institutional Investment Management  provides equity and fixed income investment strategies in the intermediary and institutional
markets via mutual funds, traditional separate accounts and sub-advisory relationships.     Asset Servicing  provides services to the
asset management industry, supporting a range of investment products, including mutual funds, alternative investments and managed accounts. Services include fund administration, fund accounting, investor services, transfer agency, distribution,
marketing, custody, alternative investment services, and collective and multiple-series trust services.

9. Acquisition   
 As previously disclosed, on May 31, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Marquette. Marquette was a
privately held financial services company with a portfolio of businesses that operated thirteen branches in Arizona and Texas, two national commercial specialty-lending businesses focused on asset-based lending and accounts receivable factoring, and
an asset-management firm. As a result of the acquisition, the Company increased its presence in Arizona and Texas and supplemented the Company s commercial-banking services with factoring and asset-based lending businesses. As of the close of
trading on the Acquisition Date, the beneficial owners of Marquette received 9.2295 shares of the Company s common stock for each share of Marquette common stock owned at that date (approximately 3.47 million shares total). The market
value of the shares of the Company s common stock issued at the effective time of the merger was approximately $179.7 million, based on the Company s closing stock price of $51.79 on May 29, 2015. The transaction was accounted for
using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations . Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated based on the estimated fair market values of the assets and liabilities acquired.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      (CONTINUED)      
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)   
   
  The following table summarizes the net assets acquired (at fair value) and consideration
transferred for Marquette  (in thousands, except for per share data)  :       
   In the acquisition, the Company purchased $980.4 million of loans at fair value. All non-performing loans and
select other classified loan relationships considered by management to be credit impaired are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 310-30, as previously discussed within Note 4,  Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses.   
 The Company assumed long-term debt obligations of Marquette with an aggregate balance of $103.1 million and an aggregate fair value of $65.5
million as of the Acquisition Date payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that have issued trust preferred securities. Interest rates
on trust preferred securities trusts are tied to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging
from January 2036 to September 2036.    The amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition reflects the Company s increased market
share and related synergies that are expected to result from combining the operations of UMB and Marquette. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Bank segment. In accordance with ASC 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , goodwill will not be
amortized but will be subject to at least an annual impairment test. As the Company acquired tax deductible goodwill in excess of the amount reported in the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. The fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets of $14.9 million is comprised of a core deposit intangible of $11.0 million, customer lists of $2.9 million and non-compete agreements of $1.0 million.

  The results of operations of Marquette are included in the results of operations of the
Company subsequent to the Acquisition Date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, acquisition expenses recognized in Noninterest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income totaled $4.5 million. This total included
$880 thousand of severance in Salaries and employee benefits and $1.7 million in Legal and consulting fees.     10. Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees     In the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to
meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, standby letters of credit, forward foreign
exchange contracts and spot foreign exchange contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contractual or notional
amount of those instruments reflects the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. Many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total amount of these commitments does not
necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company.    The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit is represented by the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses
the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.    The following
table summarizes the Company s off-balance sheet financial instruments.     Contract or Notional Amount   (in thousands):     
   
    11. Derivatives and Hedging Activities   
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives   
 The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its
exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and
duration of its assets and liabilities. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts,
the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or
expected cash payments principally related to certain fixed rate assets and liabilities. The Company also has interest rate derivatives that result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage
interest rate risk of the Company s assets or liabilities. The Company has entered into an offsetting position for each of these derivative instruments with a matching instrument from another financial institution in order to minimize its net
risk exposure resulting from such transactions.

   Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets   
 The Company s derivative assets and derivative liabilities are located within Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the
Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. This table provides a summary of the fair value of the Company s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  (in thousands) :  
   
    Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk   
 The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed rate assets and liabilities due to changes in the benchmark
interest rate, LIBOR. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve either making fixed rate payments to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable rate payments, or making variable rate payments to a counterparty in
exchange for the Company receiving fixed rate payments, over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had two interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $15.8
million that were designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company s fixed rate loan assets and brokered time deposits.  
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The Company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items in the same line item as the offsetting loss or gain on the related derivatives.  
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk   
 The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its variable-rate liabilities due to changes in the benchmark interest rate,
LIBOR. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional
amount. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had two interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $51.5 million that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company s variable rate subordinated
debentures issued by Marquette Capital Trusts III and IV. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and is
subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly into earnings for the gain or loss on the
derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized net losses of $643 thousand and $7.7 million, respectively,
in AOCI for the effective portion of the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not record any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI
related to derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on the Company s derivatives. The Company does not expect to reclassify any amounts from AOCI to Interest expense during the next 12
months as the Company s derivatives are effective after December 2018. As of September 30, 2016, the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 20 years.

   Non-designated Hedges   
 The remainder of the Company s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships. Derivatives not designated as hedges
are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps
are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not
meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 50 interest rate swaps with an aggregate
notional amount of $595.8 million related to this program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $76 thousand and $868 thousand of net losses, respectively, related to changes in fair value of these
swaps. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized $125 thousand and $211 thousand of net losses, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these swaps.  
  Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income   
 This table provides a summary of the amount of gain or loss recognized in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income
related to the Company s derivative assets and liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  (in thousands) :      

   This table provides a summary of the amount of gain or loss recognized in AOCI in the Consolidated Statements
of Comprehensive Income related to the Company s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  (in thousands) :

   Credit-risk-related Contingent Features   
 The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its
indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest, related to
these agreements was $31.1 million. The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has not yet reached its minimum collateral posting threshold under these agreements. If the Company had
breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2016, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.  
  12. Fair Value Measurements     The
following table presents information about the Company s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine
such fair value.    Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
that the Company has the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of
the hierarchy. In such cases, the fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

   Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis   
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a recurring
basis:     Trading Securities  Fair values for trading securities (including financial futures), are based on quoted market prices
where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities.  
  Securities Available for Sale  Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is
not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these
prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Additionally, throughout the year if securities are sold, comparisons are made between the pricing services prices and the market prices at which the securities were sold. Variances
are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices
provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value
hierarchy is appropriate.     Company-owned Life Insurance  Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance
policies.     Bank-owned Life Insurance  Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.  
  Derivatives  Fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows
from each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The
Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative
contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.  
  Deferred Compensation  Fair values are based on quoted market prices.  
  Contingent Consideration  The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are derived from a discounted cash flow model of future
contingent payments. The valuation of these liabilities are estimated by a collaborative effort of the Company s mergers and acquisitions group, business unit management, and the corporate accounting group. These future contingent payments are
calculated based on estimates of future income and expense from each acquisition. These estimated cash flows are projected by the business unit management and reviewed by the mergers and acquisitions group. To obtain a current valuation of these
projected cash flows, an expected present value technique is utilized to calculate a discount rate. The cash flow projections and discount rates are reviewed quarterly and updated as market conditions necessitate. Potential valuation adjustments are
made as future income and expense projections for each acquisition are made which affect the calculation of the related contingent consideration payment. These adjustments are recorded through noninterest expense.

  Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015  (in thousands):        
    Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring
basis:     Impaired loans  While the overall loan portfolio is not carried at fair value, adjustments are recorded on certain loans to
reflect write-downs that are based on the external appraised value of the underlying collateral. The external appraisals are generally based on recent sales of comparable properties which are then adjusted for the unique characteristics of the
property being valued. In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is placed on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists within the Company s
property management group and the Company s credit department. The valuation of the impaired loans is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3.  
  Other real estate owned  Other real estate owned consists of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure. This
collateral is comprised of commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto, recreational and marine vehicles. Other real estate owned is recorded as held for sale initially at the lower of the loan balance
or fair value of the collateral. The initial valuation of the foreclosed property is obtained through an appraisal process similar to the process described in the impaired loans paragraph above. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are reviewed
quarterly and updated periodically, and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. Fair value measurements may be based upon appraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing methods and those
measurements are classified as Level 3.

   Goodwill  Valuation of goodwill to determine impairment is performed annually, or more
frequently if there is an event or circumstance that would indicate impairment may have occurred. The process involves calculations to determine the fair value of each reporting unit on a stand-alone basis. A combination of formulas using current
market multiples, based on recent sales of financial institutions within the Company s geographic marketplace, is used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. That fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit,
including its recorded goodwill. Impairment is considered to have occurred if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The fair value of the Company s common stock relative to its computed
book value per share is also considered as part of the overall evaluation. These measurements are classified as Level 3.    Fair value
disclosures require disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis.
The estimated fair value of the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows  (in millions):

Cash and short-term investments  The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and
resell agreements are reasonable estimates of their fair values.     Securities held to maturity  Fair value of held-to-maturity
securities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates.     Other securities  Amount consists of FRB
and FHLB stock held by the Company, PCM equity-method investments, and other miscellaneous investments. The carrying amount of the FRB and FHLB stock equals its fair value because the shares can only be redeemed by the FRB and FHLB at their carrying
amount. The fair value of PCM marketable equity-method investments are based on quoted market prices used to estimate the value of the underlying investment. For non-marketable equity-method investments, the Company s proportionate share of the
income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag based on the valuation of the underlying investment(s).     Loans  Fair values are
estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate, consumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable interest rate categories. The
fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  
  Demand and savings deposits  The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     Time deposits  The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is
estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates that are currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.  
  Other borrowings  The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable
estimates of their fair value because of the short-term nature of their maturities.     Long-term debt  Rates currently available to
the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt.

   Other off-balance sheet instruments  The fair value of loan commitments and letters of

these instruments nor their fair value at year-end are significant to the Company s consolidated financial position.

applicable securities laws. You, however, should consult further disclosures (including disclosures of a forward-looking nature) that the Company may make in any subsequent Annual Report on Form
10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Current Report on Form 8-K.     Overview   
 The Company focuses on the following four core strategic objectives. Management believes these strategies will guide our efforts to achieve our
vision to deliver the unparalleled customer experience, all while maintaining a focus to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet.  
 The first strategic objective is a focus on improving operating efficiencies. During the second half of 2015, an in-depth review of the
organization was completed to identify efficiencies. The Company plans to continue to utilize the results of this review to simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back office functions and take advantage of synergies among
various platforms and distribution networks. The Company identified a total of $32.9 million in annual savings that are expected to be realized in the future as a result of the elimination of certain employee positions and business process
improvements. This total does not include the additional cost savings recognized related to the Marquette integration, or any ongoing efficiencies identified through our normal course of business. The Company continues to invest in technological
advances that will help management drive operating efficiencies in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating
efficiencies.    The second strategic objective is a focus on net interest income through loan and deposit growth. During the third quarter
of 2016, the Company continued to make progress on this strategy as illustrated by an increase in net interest income of $14.9 million, or 13.5 percent, from the same period in 2015. The Company has continued to show increased net interest income in
a historically low interest rate environment through the effects of increased volume of average earning assets and a low cost of funds in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2016 increased $1.5 billion,
or 9.1 percent from the same period in 2015. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 14.8 percent increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. Average loan balances increased $1.2 billion, or 14.0 percent compared to the same
period in 2015. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased 14 basis points compared to the same period in 2015.    The third
strategic objective is to grow the Company s fee-based businesses. As the industry continues to experience economic uncertainty, the Company has continued to emphasize its fee-based operations. By maintaining a diverse source of revenues, the
Company believes this strategy will help reduce the Company s exposure to sustained low interest rates. During the third quarter of 2016, noninterest income increased $12.9 million, or 11.8 percent, to $121.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. This change is discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and
treasury management businesses. At September 30, 2016, noninterest income represented 49.4 percent of total revenues, compared to 49.8 percent at September 30, 2015.  
 The fourth strategic objective is a focus on capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital
position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues
to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the strategies, increasing dividends over time, and properly utilizing a share repurchase program. At
September 30, 2016, the Company had $2.0 billion in total shareholders  equity. This is an increase of $123.8 million, or 6.5 percent, compared to total shareholders  equity at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the
Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.82 percent. The Company repurchased 10,750 shares of common stock at an average price of $56.59 per share during the third quarter of 2016.

   Earnings Summary   
 The following is a summary regarding the Company s earnings for the third quarter of 2016. The changes identified in the summary are
explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded consolidated net income of $41.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22.5 million for the same period a year earlier. This represents an 86.8 percent
increase over the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. Basic earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.86 per share ($0.85 per share fully-diluted) compared to $0.46 per share ($0.46 per share fully-diluted) for the third
quarter of 2015. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders  equity for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 were 0.85 and 8.25 percent, respectively, compared to 0.49 and 4.72 percent, respectively, for
the three-month period ended September 30, 2015.    The Company recorded consolidated net income of $115.9 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $86.4 million for the same period a year earlier. This represents a 34.1 percent increase over the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Basic earnings per share for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 were $2.37 per share ($2.36 per share fully-diluted) compared to $1.85 per share ($1.84 per share fully-diluted) for the same period in 2015. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders 
equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were 0.79 and 7.81 percent, respectively, compared to 0.66 and 6.53 percent for the same period in 2015.  
 Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 increased $14.9 million, or 13.5 percent, and $66.3
million, or 22.3 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, average earning assets increased by $1.5 billion, or 9.1 percent, and for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016, they increased by $2.0 billion, or 12.1 percent, compared to the same periods in 2015. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 2.87 percent and 2.84 percent for the three and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016, compared to 2.73 percent and 2.60 percent for the same periods in 2015. The Marquette acquisition added earning assets with an acquired value of $1.2 billion primarily from loan balances with an acquired value of $980.4
million at May 31, 2015. The Marquette acquisition also added interest-bearing liabilities with an acquired value of $910.8 million primarily from interest-bearing deposits of $708.7 million at May 31, 2015.  
 The provision for loan losses increased by $10.5 million to $13.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, and
increased by $14.5 million to $25.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. This increase is a result of applying the Company s methodology for computing the allowance for loan
losses. A significant driver of credit quality is nonperforming loans. The Company s nonperforming loans increased $29.7 million to $79.6 million at September 30, 2016, compared to September 30, 2015, and increased $18.5 million,
compared to December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily related to the migration of two large commercial credits to nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2016. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.88
percent as of September 30, 2016, compared to 0.86 percent at September 30, 2015. For a description of the Company s methodology for computing the allowance for loan losses, please see the summary discussion of the Allowance for Loan
Losses within the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates subsection of the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Form 10-K.  
 Noninterest income increased by $12.9 million, or 11.8 percent, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, and increased by
$5.9 million, or 1.7 percent, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income.  
 Noninterest expense decreased by $5.5 million, or 3.0 percent, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, and increased by
$23.9 million, or 4.6 percent, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense.

   Net Interest Income   
 Net interest income is a significant source of the Company s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets
exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect net interest income. As noted above, the
impacts of the Marquette acquisition are included in these results. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, average earning assets increased by $1.5 billion, or 9.1 percent, and for the nine-month period ended September 30,
2016, they increased by $2.0 billion, or 12.1 percent, compared to the same periods in 2015. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 2.87 percent and 2.84 percent for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016, compared to 2.73 percent and 2.60 percent for the same periods in 2015.

  Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of
interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread and margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 13 and 14 basis points, respectively, compared to the same period in 2015. Net interest spread
and margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 23 and 24 basis points, respectively, compared to the same period in 2015. These increases are primarily due to favorable volume and rate variances on loans. These rate
variances have led to an increase in interest income partially offset by an increase in interest expense, resulting in an increase in the Company s net interest income during 2016 as compared to results for the same periods in 2015. For the
impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income.  
  Table 1      AVERAGE BALANCES/YIELDS AND RATES  
(tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands)       The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average
earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax
equivalent basis adjustment would have been 2.86 percent for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2.71 percent for the same period in 2015. The average yield on earning assets without the tax equivalent basis adjustment would
have been 2.83 percent for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2.57 percent for the same period in 2015.

  Table 2 presents the dollar amount of change in net interest income and margin due to volume and
rate. Table 2 also reflects the effect that interest-free funds have on net interest margin. Although the average balance of interest-free funds (total earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) increased $11.4 million for the three-month
period and $194.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, the benefit from interest free funds was relatively flat, or one basis point in the three-month and nine-month periods due to
increased yields on earning assets, offset by an increase in rates of interest-bearing liabilities.     Table 2

   Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses   
 The allowance for loan losses (ALL) represents management s judgment of the losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio as of the
balance sheet date. An analysis is performed quarterly to determine the appropriate balance of the ALL. This analysis considers items such as historical loss trends, a review of individual loans, migration analysis, current economic conditions, loan
growth and characteristics, industry or segment concentration and other factors. After the balance sheet analysis is performed for the ALL, the provision for loan losses is computed as the amount required to adjust the ALL to the appropriate level.
   Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded $13.0 million and $25.0 million as provision for loan losses for the three
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.5 million and $10.5 million for the same periods in 2015, respectively. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ALL increased to 0.88 percent of total loans as of September 30,
2016, compared to 0.86 percent of total loans as of the same period in 2015.    Table 3 presents a summary of the Company s ALL for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net charge-offs were $15.7 million for the nine months ended 2016, compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2015. See  Credit Risk
Management  under  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in this report for information relating to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, restructured loans and other credit risk matters.

   Noninterest Income   
 A key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to enhance profitability and provide steady income. This income is
non-credit related and not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates.    The Company s noninterest income provides the
opportunity to offer products and services, which management believes will more closely align the customer with the Company. The Company generates noninterest income from trust and securities processing, bankcard, brokerage, health care services,
and treasury management. Management believes it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most of these products and services share common platforms and support structures.  
  Table 4      SUMMARY OF NONINTEREST INCOME  
(unaudited, dollars in thousands)         
   Fee-based, or noninterest income (summarized in Table 4), increased by $12.9 million, or 11.8 percent, during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased by $5.9 million, or 1.7 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income
and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category.    Trust and securities processing consists of fees earned on personal and
corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and investment management services, and servicing of mutual fund assets. The decrease in these fees for the three and nine-month periods compared to the same periods last
year was primarily due  
      52  

Table of Contents  

to changes in two categories of income. First, advisory fee income from the Scout Funds for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, decreased by $4.7 million, or 36.5
percent, and $19.8 million, or 44.0 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, due to declines in the underlying assets under management (AUM) for the respective periods. Additionally, the mix of AUM in the Institutional Investment
Management segment has shifted to a higher percentage of fixed income versus equity as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015. Second, fund administration and custody services fees for the three and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016, decreased by $1.0 million, or 4.3 percent, and $2.6 million, or 3.7 percent, respectively, due to a decrease in the underlying assets under administration. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily
asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both
new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels.    Trading and investment banking fees for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased $3.1 million, or 105.9 percent, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, increased $1.7 million, or 11.8 percent. The income in this category is market driven and
impacted by general increases or decreases in trading volume.    Brokerage fees for the three and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016, increased $1.8 million, or 59.3 percent, and increased $4.4 million, or 50.4 percent, respectively. These increases were driven by higher money market balances and the related 12b-1 fees.  
 During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, $3.0 million and $8.5 million in pre-tax gains were recognized on the
sales of securities available for sale, compared to $0.1 million and $8.4 million for the same periods in 2015. The investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market
conditions and the Company s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains.  
 During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, gains of $1.6 million and $2.2 million of equity earnings on
alternative investments were recognized on PCM investments, respectively, compared to losses of $5.0 million and $7.0 million for the same periods in 2015 due to changes in the underlying fund investments.  
 Other noninterest income for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, increased $3.6 million, or 113.0 percent, and $7.5
million, or 68.8 percent, respectively, primarily driven by increases of $3.9 million and $6.9 million in company-owned and bank-owned life insurance.

  SUMMARY OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE   (unaudited in thousands)          
   Noninterest expense decreased by $5.5 million, or 3.0 percent, for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and increased $23.9 million, or 4.6 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. Table 5 above summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year comparison
for each category.    Salaries and employee benefits increased by $4.6 million, or 4.4 percent, and increased $22.4 million, or 7.4 percent,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. For the nine month increase, the Marquette acquisition contributed approximately $11.5 million of this increase and is embedded in
the breakouts in the following paragraph. Non-acquisition related severances for the three and nine month comparative periods increased $0.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, and included in the commissions and bonuses line as noted
below.    Salaries and wages decreased $0.7 million, or 1.0 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and increased $9.4
million, or 5.0 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Commissions and bonuses increased $2.0 million, or 8.2 percent, and $8.0 million, or 12.1 percent, for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 driven by increased company performance. Employee benefits expense increased $3.4 million, or 26.2 percent, and $5.0 million, or 10.1 percent, for the
three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, due to an increase the fair value of the Company s deferred compensation plan.

  Processing fees expense decreased $1.5 million, or 12.0 percent, and $4.0 million, or 10.6
percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to decreased fees paid by the third-party advisor to distributors of the Scout Funds.  
 Legal and consulting expense decreased $4.2 million, or 48.5 percent, and $4.8 million, or 25.1 percent, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The decreases in both periods are primarily due to the reduction of the use of consulting services.  
 Other noninterest expense decreased $1.3 million, or 18.7 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and increased $3.6
million, or 18.8 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The decrease in the three months period is primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in off-balance sheet commitment
reserves and the increase in the nine months period is primarily due to fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities recorded in 2015.  
 Total acquisition expenses recognized in noninterest expense during the third quarter 2016 totaled $0.4 million and totaled $4.5 million for
the first nine months of 2016, compared to $4.9 million and $6.4 million for the same periods in 2015, respectively.     Income Tax Expense   
 The Company s effective tax rate was 24.3 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 27.6 percent for the same
period in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in federal tax credits and a larger portion of income earned from excludable life insurance policy gains.

  Bank net income increased by $39.7 million, or 63.5 percent, to $102.2 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Net interest income increased $61.6 million, or 21.0 percent, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven
by strong loan growth, a change in the Company s earning asset mix, and higher loan yields. Provision for loan losses increased by $14.5 million to adjust the related ALL to the appropriate level based on the inherent risk in the loan portfolio
for this segment. Noninterest income increased $25.2 million, or 12.0 percent, over the same period in 2015 primarily driven by the following increases: unrealized gains on PCM equity method investments of $9.2 million, brokerage and mutual
fund income of $4.4 million due to an increase in 12b-1 fees, bank-owned and company-owned life insurance income of $4.0 million, insurance and annuities income of $1.7 million, trust and securities processing income of $1.6 million, and healthcare
deposit service charges of $1.4 million. These increases were offset by decreases in commercial and consumer deposit service charges of $1.5 million.  
 Noninterest expense increased $23.6 million, or 5.8 percent, to $431.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily driven by increases of $18.8 million in salaries and benefits, $1.2 million in bankcard expense, $1.1 million in services and supplies, $1.1 million in amortization of intangibles,
$1.3 million in regulatory fees, and $1.0 million in furniture and equipment expense. The increase in salaries and benefits is driven by increases of $10.7 million in salary and wage expense, $5.1 million in bonus and commission expense, and $3.0
million in employee benefit expense. The increase in employee benefit expense was driven, in part, by a $0.9 million increase in the fair value of the Company s deferred compensation plan. Additionally, there was an increase in other
noninterest expense of $1.2 million, largely due to an increase of $2.4 million in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities incurred in 2015, offset by a decline in operational losses in the comparative periods.

  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Institutional Investment Management net income
decreased $12.4 million, or 80.2 percent, compared to the same period in 2015. Noninterest income decreased $17.2 million, or 23.2 percent, due to a $15.1 million decrease in advisory fees from the Scout Funds offset by an increase of $0.2
million in advisory fees from separately managed accounts, both of which are driven by changes in AUM. During the period of December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 total Scout AUM increased from $27.2 billion to $28.1 billion, while during
the period of December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015 Scout AUM decreased from $31.2 billion to $28.0 billion. Additionally, the mix of AUM has shifted between the two periods from 76.0 percent fixed income and 24.0 percent equity as of
September 30, 2015 to 82.9 percent fixed income and 17.1 percent equity as of September 30, 2016. The increase in noninterest expense of $0.2 million, or 0.4 percent, as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by increases of $5.7
million in salaries and benefits expense driven by severance and increased incentives and increases in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan, and $1.1 million in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities incurred in
2015. These increases were offset by decreases of $4.5 million in fees paid by the advisor to third-party distributors of the Scout Funds, $1.6 million in technology, service and overhead expenses as compared to the prior year, and $0.5 million
in marketing and business development expense.     Table 8   
  Asset Servicing Operating Results   (unaudited, dollars in thousands)      
   
   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Asset Servicing net income increased $2.2 million, or 26.1
percent, to $10.6 million as compared to the same period in 2015. Net interest income increased $4.6 million compared to the same period last year. Noninterest income decreased $2.1 million, or 3.1 percent, largely due to decreased fund
administration, fund transfer agency, and custody fees. As of September 30, 2016, assets under administration totaled $186.2 billion compared to $192.0 billion at September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
noninterest expense increased $0.1 million, or 0.2 percent, as compared to the same period last year, primarily due to an increase of $1.5 million in salary and benefits expense partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in technology, service
and overhead expenses.

   Balance Sheet Analysis   
 Total assets of the Company increased by $631.9 million, or 3.3 percent, as of September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015,
primarily due to an increase in loan balances of $862.7 million, or 9.1 percent, an increase in held-to-maturity (HTM) securities of $342.0 million, or 51.3 percent, offset by a decrease in available-for-sale (AFS) securities of $511.3 million, or
7.5 percent.    Total assets of the Company increased $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2016, or 6.1 percent, compared to
September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in loan balances of $1.2 billion, or 13.8 percent, and an increase in HTM securities of $420.6 million, or 71.5 percent, which were partially offset by a decrease in AFS securities of $376.1
million, or 5.6 percent.    The overall increase in total assets from September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015 to
September 30, 2016 is related to an increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase and deposits during those periods. Compared to December 31, 2015, total deposits increased by $285.5 million, or 1.9
percent, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased $203.1 million, or 11.2 percent, as of September 30, 2016. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased by
$678.5 million, or 50.5 percent, and total deposits increased $316.7 million, or 2.1 percent, from September 30, 2015.     Table 9

    Loans   
 Loans represent the Company s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes
its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that generate additional noninterest income for the Company.  
 Actual loan balances totaled $10.3 billion as of September 30, 2016, and increased $862.7 million, or 9.1 percent, compared to
December 31, 2015 and increased $1.2 billion, or 13.8 percent, compared to September 30, 2015. Compared to December 31, 2015, commercial real estate loans increased $347.8 million, or 13.1 percent, construction real estate loans
increased $266.1 million, or 63.9 percent, and commercial loans increased $232.8 million, or 5.5 percent. Compared to September 30, 2015, commercial real estate loans increased $518.7 million, or 20.8 percent, commercial loans increased $351.2
million, or 8.6 percent, and construction real estate loans increased $315.6 million, or 86.0 percent. The increase in total loans is driven by the Company s focus on generating higher-yielding earning assets by shifting assets from the
securities portfolio to the loan portfolio.    Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under  Credit Risk
Management  within  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in this report.     Investment Securities   
 The Company s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous
investments. Investment securities totaled $7.4 billion as of September 30, 2016 and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2015 and comprised 40.5 percent and 43.0 percent of the Company s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates.

  The Company s AFS securities portfolio comprised 84.7 percent of the Company s
investment securities portfolio at September 30, 2016, compared to 89.9 percent at December 31, 2015. The Company s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying
securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio increased from 44.2 months at September 30, 2015 to 45.0 months at
September 30, 2016. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is
to maximize return within the Company s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk.    Management expects
collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $5.1 billion of AFS securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits,
other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at September 30, 2016. Of this amount, securities with a market value of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2016 were pledged at the Federal
Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of that date.    The Company s HTM securities portfolio consists of private placement
bonds, which are issued primarily to refinance existing revenue bonds in the healthcare and education sectors. The HTM portfolio totaled $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2016, an increase of $342.0 million, or 51.3 percent, from
December 31, 2015. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 10.3 years at September 30, 2016, compared to 9.8 years at December 31, 2015.  
 The securities portfolio generates the Company s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an
average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.08 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1.94 percent for the same period in 2015.  
  Deposits and Borrowed Funds     Deposits
increased $285.5 million, or 1.9 percent, from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 and increased $316.7 million, or 2.1 percent, from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Total interest-bearing deposits increased $584.1
million from December 31, 2015 offset by a decrease of $298.6 million in non-interest bearing deposits. Total interest-bearing deposits increased $566.3 million from September 30, 2015 offset by a decrease of $249.6 million in
noninterest-bearing deposits.    Deposits represent the Company s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core
deposits garnered by the Company s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and mutual fund servicing segments, in order to attract and retain additional core deposits.
Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company s key strengths given its competitive product mix.  
 Long-term debt totaled $75.4 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $86.1 million as of December 31, 2015, and $83.5 million as
of September 30, 2015. As part of the Marquette acquisition, the Company assumed long-term debt obligations with an aggregate balance of $103.1 million and an aggregate fair value of $65.5 million as of May 31, 2015 payable to four
unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that had issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations had an aggregate contractual
balance of $103.1 million and had an aggregate carrying value of $66.7 million as of September 30, 2016. The interest rates on trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are tied to the three-month LIBOR rate with spreads ranging from 133
basis points to 160 basis points, which reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036.  
 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase totaled $2.0 billion at September 30, 2016, $1.8 billion at
December 31, 2015 and $1.3 billion at September 30, 2015. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar
issues at an agreed-upon price and date.

   Capital and Liquidity   
 The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access
to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on
short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory
requirements.    Total shareholders  equity was $2.0 billion at September 30, 2016, a $130.9 million increase compared to
December 31, 2015, and a $123.8 million increase compared to September 30, 2015.    The Company s Board of Directors
authorized, at its April 26, 2016 and April 28, 2015 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company s common stock during the twelve months following the meetings. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company acquired 292,624 shares and 119,690 shares of its common stock under the 2016 and 2015 repurchase plans, respectively. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than through these plans.  
 On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a $0.255 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on January 3, 2017, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2016.    Through the Company s relationship with the FHLB of Des
Moines, the Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB.
The Company s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $499.0 million as of September 30, 2016. The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances at FHLB of Des Moines as of September 30, 2016. Additionally, the Company owns $0.1 million of
FHLB of San Francisco stock, acquired as part of the Marquette acquisition. The Company paid off $15.0 million of FHLB of San Francisco advances during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and had no outstanding advances at FHLB of
San Francisco as of September 30, 2016.    Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital
standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution s assets. Effective January 1, 2015, the Company implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB in July 2013. Basel III capital rules
increase minimum requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. The rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a minimum tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6 percent. A financial institution s total capital is also required to equal at least 8 percent of risk-weighted assets. At least half of that 8 percent must consist of tier 1 core capital, and the remainder may be tier 2
supplementary capital. The Basel III regulatory capital rules include transitional periods for various components of the rules that require full compliance for the Company by January 1, 2019, including a capital conservation buffer requirement
of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets for which the transitional period began on January 1, 2016.  
      60  

Table of Contents  

  The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain
off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also
required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4 percent. The leverage ratio is tier 1 core capital to total average assets less goodwill and intangibles. The Company s capital position as of September 30, 2016 is
summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.     Table 10   
   
   The Company s per share data is summarized in the table below.  
   
    Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   
 The Company s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and
forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. Please see Note 10,  Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these
arrangements.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management
evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for loan losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies and litigation. Management bases its
estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates.  
 A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  section of the Form 10-K.

ITEM 3.  
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        Risk Management   
 Market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may
be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange prices, commodity prices, or equity prices. Financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other
than trading.    The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for
purposes other than trading. The following discussion of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion
of the Company s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.     Interest Rate Risk   
 In the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. To minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest
income and exposure levels to economic losses, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and approved by the Board. The
ALCO is responsible for approving and ensuring compliance with asset/liability management policies, including interest rate exposure. The Company s primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk is the Net Interest
Income Simulation Analysis. The Company also uses a Net Portfolio Value model to measure market value risk under various rate change scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities at specific points in time. On a limited basis, the Company uses hedges such as swaps and futures contracts to manage interest rate risk on certain loans, trading securities, trust preferred securities, and deposits. See
further information in Note 11  Derivatives and Hedging Activities  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Overall, the Company manages interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an
acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability, liquidity, interest rate risk, and credit risk.  
  Net Interest Income Modeling     The
Company s primary interest rate risk tool, the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis, measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin. This analysis incorporates all of the
Company s assets and liabilities together with assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through these simulations, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 300 basis point upward or a 100 basis point
downward gradual change (e.g. ramp) and immediate change (e.g. shock) of market interest rates over a two year period. In ramp scenarios, rates change gradually for a one year period and remain constant in year two. In shock scenarios, rates change
immediately and the change is sustained for the remainder of the two year scenario horizon. Assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management outlook and repricing strategies. Asset prepayments
and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes. The results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized and management evaluates the sensitivity of the
simulation results on a regular basis.

  Table 11 shows the net interest income percentage increase or decrease over the next twelve and
twenty-four month periods as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and a constant sized balance sheet with runoff being replaced.  
  Table 11      MARKET RISK   (unaudited)   
      
   The Company is positioned to benefit from increases in interest rates. Net interest income is projected to
increase in rising interest rate scenarios due to yields on earning assets increasing more due to changes in market rates than the cost of paying liabilities is projected to increase. The Company s ability to price deposits in a rising rate
environment consistent with our history is a key assumption in these scenarios. Due to the already low interest rate environment, the Company did not include a 100 basis point falling scenario. There is little room for projected yields on
liabilities to decrease.    Trading Account   
 The Company s subsidiary, UMB Bank, n.a. (the Bank), carries taxable governmental securities in a trading account that is maintained in
accordance with Board-approved policy and procedures. The policy limits the amount and type of securities that can be carried in the trading account and requires compliance with any limits under applicable law and regulations, and mandates the use
of a value-at-risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters. The risk associated with the carrying of trading securities is offset by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the trading
account and futures contracts marked to market daily. This account had a balance of $58.1 million as of September 30, 2016, $29.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and $23.7 million as of September 30, 2015.  
 The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than
trading. The discussion in Table 11 above of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading, because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the
Company s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.     Other Market Risk   
 The Company does have minimal foreign currency risk as a result of foreign exchange contracts. See Note 10  Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Credit Risk Management   
 Credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. The Company utilizes a
centralized credit administration function, which provides information on the Bank s risk levels, delinquencies, an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure. Loan requests are centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application
of the loan policy and standards. In addition, the Company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the Bank. This review team performs periodic examinations of the bank s loans for credit quality, documentation and loan
administration. The respective regulatory authority of the Bank also reviews loan portfolios.    A primary indicator of credit quality and
risk management is the level of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans on nonaccrual. The Company s nonperforming loans increased $29.7 million to $79.6 million at September 30, 2016,
compared to September 30, 2015, and increased $18.5 million, compared to December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by the migration of two non-energy commercial credits during the third quarter of 2016.  
 The Company had $0.3 million and $2.6 million of other real estate owned as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3.3
million of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2015. Loans past due more than 90 days totaled $2.7 million as of September 30, 2016, compared to $2.6 million at September 30, 2015 and $7.3 million as of December 31,
2015.    A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due 90 days or more and/or when management has considerable
doubt about the borrower s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted. The accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash.  
 Certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of
the respective borrowers. The Company had $54.4 million of restructured loans at September 30, 2016, $35.3 million at September 30, 2015, and $36.6 million at December 31, 2015.

   Liquidity Risk   
 Liquidity represents the Company s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability
of additional funds. The Company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds.
Ultimately, the Company believes public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of
assets, which include $6.3 billion of high-quality securities available for sale. The liquidity of the Company and the Bank is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits. Additionally, management believes
it can raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms in the future, should the need arise.    Another factor affecting liquidity is the
amount of deposits and customer repurchase agreements that have pledging requirements. All customer repurchase agreements require collateral in the form of a security. The U.S. Government, other public entities, and certain trust depositors require
the Company to pledge securities if their deposit balances are greater than the FDIC-insured deposit limitations. These pledging requirements affect liquidity risk in that the related security cannot otherwise be disposed due to the pledging
restriction. At September 30, 2016, $5.1 billion, or 81.5 percent, of the securities available-for-sale were pledged or used as collateral, compared to $5.9 billion, or 86.7 percent, at December 31, 2015. However of these amounts,
securities with a market value of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2016 and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2015 were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of those dates.  
 The Company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity. These commitments include unused commitments to extend credit,
standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit. The total amount of these commercial commitments at September 30, 2016 was $9.6 billion. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the
total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company.    The
Company s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, operating expenses, and treasury stock purchases. Management fees and dividends received from bank and non-bank subsidiaries traditionally have been
sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future. The Bank is subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the Company. For the most part, the Bank can pay dividends at least equal to its current
year s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval. The Company also uses cash to inject capital into its bank and non-bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate capital as well as fund strategic initiatives.  
 To enhance general working capital needs, the Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow
up to $50.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company s option, either 1.00 percent above LIBOR or 1.75 percent below Prime on the date of an advance. The Company will
also pay a 0.3 percent unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of credit. The Company had no advances outstanding at September 30, 2016.  
 The Company is a member bank of the FHLB. The Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding
sources through FHLB advances. Additionally, the Company has access to borrow up to $499.0 million through advances at the FHLB of Des Moines, but had no outstanding FHLB Des Moines advances as of September 30, 2016.  
  Operational Risk     Operational risk
generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by third parties. This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside
the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of internal control over financial reporting and compliance requirements, and unplanned interruptions in service.
This risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. Included in the legal and regulatory issues
with which the Company must comply are a number of imposed rules resulting from the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.

Table of Contents  

  The Company operates in many markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to
properly process a high number of transactions. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer
damage to its reputation. In order to address this risk, management maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, safeguarding of assets from misuse
or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data.    The Company maintains systems of controls that provide management
with timely and accurate information about the Company s operations. These systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the Company s financial strength, the environment in which it operates, and
considering factors such as competition and regulation. The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed on a uniform basis. In certain cases, the
Company has experienced losses from operational risk. Such losses have included the effects of operational errors that the Company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income. While there can be no assurance that the Company
will not suffer such losses in the future, management continually monitors and works to improve its internal control over financial reporting, systems and corporate-wide processes and procedures.  

ITEM 4.  
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended, requires the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to make certain certifications with respect to this Form 10-Q and to the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
The Company has a Code of Ethics that expresses the values that drive employee behavior and maintains the Company s commitment to the highest standards of ethics.  
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures     The
Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as such term is
defined in  Rule 13a-15(e)  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.     Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company completed the implementation of FIS Global s IBS Loan system. This implementation
was subject to various testing and review procedures prior to execution. The Company believes the conversion to, and implementation of, this new system further strengthened its existing internal control over financial reporting by enhancing
certain business processes. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Marquette, we continue to integrate certain business processes and systems of Marquette. Accordingly, certain changes have been made and will continue to be made
to our internal control over financial reporting until such time as this integration is complete.    Other than the changes described above,
there have been no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such control over financial reporting during the period covered by this
Form 10-Q.
