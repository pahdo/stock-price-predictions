  1. Organization and basis of presentation 
  Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, is a global oilfield products company, serving the drilling, subsea, completions, production and infrastructure sectors of the oil and natural gas industry. The Company designs, manufactures and distributes products and engages in aftermarket services, parts supply and related services that complement the Company s product offering.  
  Basis of presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
  The Company's investment in an operating entity where the Company has the ability to exert significant influence, but does not control operating and financial policies, is accounted for using the equity method. The Company's share of the net income (loss)  of this entity is recorded as "Earnings from equity investment" in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The investment in this entity is included in "Investment in unconsolidated subsidiary" in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports its share of equity earnings within operating income (loss) as the investee's operations are integral to the operations of the Company. 
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included. Operating results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or any other interim period.   
  These interim financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for complete consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   February 26, 2016  , as updated by Exhibit 99.4 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2016 (the "Annual Report"). 
   
  2. Recent accounting pronouncements 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), which are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15 Cash Flow Statement (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice, including: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The only issue currently relevant to the Company is distributions received from equity method investees, where the new guidance allows an accounting policy election between the cumulative earnings approach and the nature distribution approach. The Company will continue to use the cumulative earnings approach, therefore the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates No. 2014-09 and No. 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting. This new guidance rescinded certain SEC staff observer comments in Topic 605 related to revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process and accounting for  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents

  (Unaudited)  

shipping and handling fees and costs, in Topic 932 related to gas-balancing arrangements, and in Topic 815 related to the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid instrument issued in the form of a share. ASU 2016-11 is effective upon adoption of Topic 606 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued a series of ASUs on revenue standards, including No. 2016-08 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations, No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and No. 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. ASU No. 2016-08 amended the guidance in the new revenue standard on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU No. 2016-10 amended and clarified the guidance in the new revenue standard on identifying performance obligation and accounting for licenses of intellectual property and addressed the implementation issues.  ASU No. 2016-12 amended and updated only the narrow aspects of Topic 606.  The above standards will take effect for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the above guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This new guidance includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements: a)  All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement; b) Excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity; c) An entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur; d) The threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions; e) Cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. There are also two additional provisions for non-public entities that do not apply to the Company. The standard will take effect for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.  Under this new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of greater than twelve months. The standard will take effect for public companies with fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance.  
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern. The new standard requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt as to an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for both annual and interim reporting periods. The guidance is effective for the Company for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The new standard is to be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies are able to early adopt the pronouncement, however not before fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the adoption and the implementation approach to be used.

3  . Acquisitions and Dispositions 
  2016 Acquisition 
  In April 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the wholesale completion packers business of Team Oil Tools, Inc. The acquisition includes a wide variety of completion and service tools, including retrievable and permanent packers, bridge plugs and accessories which are sold to  oilfield service providers, packer repair companies and distributors on a global basis, and is included in the Completions segment. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have not been presented because they are not material to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  2015 Acquisition 
  Effective February 2, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of J-Mac Tool, Inc. ("J-Mac") for consideration of   $61.9 million  , including   $1.1 million   paid subsequent to September 30, 2016 in conjunction with the completion of the review of working capital. J-Mac is a Fort Worth, Texas based manufacturer of high quality hydraulic fracturing pumps, power ends, fluid ends and other pump accessories. J-Mac is included in the Completions segment. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition (in thousands):  

Revenues and net income (loss) related to the acquisitions were not significant for the current and prior periods presented in this report. Pro forma results of operations for 2015 and 2016 acquisitions have not been presented because the effects were not material to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on either an individual or aggregate basis. 
  Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale 
  In the third quarter 2016, management approved a plan to sell the land and building located in Robstown, Texas (the  Robstown assets ) in the Completions segment with a total carrying value of   $8.2 million  . The decision to sell the Robstown assets was primarily intended to achieve cost savings from the consolidation of manufacturing locations. The Robstown assets were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016, and were reported within the balance sheet line item Prepaid expenses and other current assets.  The Robstown assets are recorded at their fair value, net of estimated cost to sell, of   $6.1 million  . As a result,  a   $2.1 million   write-down was recorded during the third quarter of 2016, which is included in Loss (gain) on sale of assets and other in our Condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Robstown assets are expected to be sold in the fourth quarter of 2016.

6. Investment in unconsolidated subsidiary 
  Effective July 1, 2013, the Company jointly purchased Global Tubing, LLC ("Global Tubing") with an equal partner, with management retaining a small interest. Global Tubing is a Dayton, Texas based provider of coiled tubing strings and related services. The Company's equity investment is reported in the Completions segment and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As Global Tubing's products are complementary to the Company s well intervention and stimulation products and the investment's business is integral to the Company's operations, the earnings from the equity investment are included within operating income.  
  Condensed financial data for the equity investment in the unconsolidated subsidiary is summarized as follows (in thousands): 

7. Debt 
  Notes payable and lines of credit as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following (in thousands):

Senior Notes Due 2021 
  The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of   6.250%   per annum, payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, and mature on October 1, 2021. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company s subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility and rank junior to, among other indebtedness, the Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Credit Facility.  
  Credit Facility 
  On February 25, 2016, the Company amended its senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Facility" and such amendment, the "Amended Facility") to reduce commitment fees and provide borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes. The Amended Facility provides for a revolving credit line of up to   $200.0 million  , including up to   $25.0 million   available for letters of credit and up to   $10.0 million   in swingline loans. Availability under the Amended Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to eligible accounts receivable in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, eligible inventory in the United States, and cash on hand.  
  The Amended Facility reduced the borrowing capacity from   $600.0 million   to   $200.0 million  . Accordingly, the Company has written off $  2.6 million   of the deferred financing costs related to the Credit Facility.  
  The Credit Facility matures in November 2018. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, and   $17.3 million   of outstanding letters of credit.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the capacity to borrow an additional   $108.0 million   subject to certain limitations in the Credit Facility. Weighted average interest rates under the Credit Facility for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were approximately   2%  . 
  There have been no changes to the financial covenants disclosed in Item 8 of the Annual Report, as updated by Exhibit 99.4 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2016, and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  .  
   
  8. Income taxes 
  The Company's effective tax rate was   38.4%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   23.3%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate was   39.6%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   12.2%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The tax rates for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are higher than the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the losses incurred in the United States, which are benefited at a higher statutory tax rate, offset by earnings outside the United States in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates. The effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on the Company's relative mix of U.S. and non-U.S. earnings and losses.The Company expects to realize a net operating loss in the United States in 2016. In the third quarter 2016, the Company determined it would elect to carry the net operating loss back to recover taxes paid in earlier periods. As a result, the tax benefit of   $32.8 million   was reclassified from deferred taxes to income tax receivable.  
   
  9. Fair value measurements 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   debt outstanding under the Credit Facility, and   $17.3 million   of outstanding letters of credit. Substantially all of the debt, if any, under the Credit Facility incurs interest at a variable interest rate and, therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value. The fair value of the debt is classified as a Level 2 measurement because interest rates charged are similar to other financial instruments with similar terms and maturities. 
  The fair value of the Company s Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy and is based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value and the carrying value of the Company s Senior Notes approximated   $378.5 million   and   $402.1 million  , respectively. At   December 31, 2015  , the fair value and the carrying value of the Company s Senior Notes approximated   $334.1 million   and   $402.5 million  , respectively. 
  There were   no   outstanding financial assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that required measuring the amounts at fair value. The Company did not change its valuation techniques associated with recurring fair value measurements from prior periods and there were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

10. Business segments  
  Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segments. Completions was designated as a separate segment in recognition of its expanded operations and its significant growth potential.  The Company is reporting its results of operations in the following   three   reportable segments: Drilling   Subsea, Completions  and Production   Infrastructure, instead of the original   two   reportable segments. Management s change in the composition of the Company s reportable segments was made in order to align with activity drivers and the customers of our product group, and how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. This change will be reflected on a retrospective basis in accordance with GAAP, with prior years adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. The amounts indicated below as "Corporate" relate to costs and assets not allocated to the reportable operating segments. Summary financial data by segment follows (in thousands): 

A summary of consolidated assets by reportable segment is as follows (in thousands): 

Corporate assets include, among other items, prepaid assets, cash and deferred financing costs.

11. Earnings per share 
  The calculation of basic and diluted earnings (losses) per share for each period presented was as follows (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The diluted earnings per share calculation excludes all stock options for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , because there is a net loss for each respective period. The diluted earnings per share calculation excludes approximately   2.0 million   stock options for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , and approximately   1.8 million   stock options for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because they were anti-dilutive as the option exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common stock.  
   
  12  . Commitments and contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company is, and in the future could be, involved in various pending or threatened legal actions that may or may not be covered by insurance. Management has reviewed such pending judicial and legal proceedings, the reasonably anticipated costs and expenses in connection with such proceedings, and the availability and limits of insurance coverage. Reserves have been established that are believed to be appropriate in light of the outcomes that are considered to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. The reserves accrued at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are immaterial.  
   
  13. Stockholders' equity 
  Share-based compensation  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   818,620   options and   1,716,239   shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units, which includes   257,900   performance share awards with a market condition. The stock options were granted with exercise prices of   $9.39  . Of the restricted stock or restricted stock units granted,   1,338,522   vest ratably over   four years   on each anniversary of the grant date.   119,817   shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units were granted to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors, which have a   twelve   month vesting period from the grant date. The performance share awards granted may settle for between   zero   and   two   shares of the Company's common stock. The number of shares issued pursuant to the performance share awards will be determined based on the total shareholder return of the Company's common stock as compared to a group of peer companies, measured annually over a   one year  ,   two   year and   three  -year performance period.  
   
  14. Related party transactions 
  The Company has sold and purchased equipment and services to and from various affiliates of certain directors. The dollar amounts related to these related party activities are not material to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Overview 
  We are a global oilfield products company, serving the subsea, drilling, completion, production and infrastructure sectors of the oil and natural gas industry. We design, manufacture and distribute products, and engage in aftermarket services, parts supply and related services that complement our product offering. Our product offering includes a mix of highly engineered capital products and frequently replaced items that are used in the exploration, development, production and transportation of oil and natural gas. Our capital products are directed at: drilling rig equipment for new rigs, upgrades and refurbishment projects; subsea construction and development projects; the placement of production equipment on new producing wells; pressure pumping equipment; and downstream capital projects. Our engineered systems are critical components used on drilling rigs, for completions or in the course of subsea operations, while our consumable products are used to maintain efficient and safe operations at well sites in the well construction process, within the supporting infrastructure and at processing centers and refineries. Historically, just over 60% of our revenue is derived from consumable products and activity-based equipment, while the balance is derived from capital products and a small amount from rental and other services.  
  We seek to design, manufacture and supply reliable products that create value for our diverse customer base, which includes, among others, oil and natural gas operators, land and offshore drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, subsea construction and service companies, and pipeline and refinery operators.  
  Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we realigned our segments.  Completions was designated as a separate segment in recognition of the expansion in these operations and its significant growth potential.  We are reporting our results of operations in the following reportable segments: Drilling   Subsea, Completions and Production   Infrastructure, instead of the original two reportable segments. Management s change in the composition of the Company s reportable segments was made in order to align with activity drivers and the customers of our product groups and how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. This change will be reflected on a retrospective basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, with prior years adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. The new segments are composed of the following: 
             
    Drilling   Subsea segment  . This segment designs and manufactures products and provides related services to the drilling and subsea construction and services markets.  The products and related services consist primarily of: (i) capital equipment and a broad line of expendable drilling products consumed in the drilling process; and (ii)  subsea capital equipment, specialty components and tooling, products used in subsea pipeline infrastructure, and a broad suite of complementary subsea technical services and rental items.  
                
    Completions segment.   This segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and provides related services to the well construction, completion, stimulation and intervention markets. The products and related services consist primarily of: (i) well construction casing and cementing equipment, cable protectors used in completions, composite plugs used for zonal isolation in hydraulic fracturing and wireline flow-control products; and (ii) capital and consumable products sold to the pressure pumping, hydraulic fracturing and flowback services markets, including hydraulic fracturing pumps, pump consumables and flow iron as well as coiled tubing, wireline cable, and pressure control equipment used in the well completion and intervention service markets. 
                
    Production   Infrastructure segment  . This segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and provides related equipment and services for production and infrastructure markets.  The products and related services consist primarily of: (i) engineered process systems, production equipment and related field services, as well as desalinization equipment; and (ii) a wide range of industrial valves focused on serving upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and natural gas customers. 
     Market Conditions 
  The level of demand for our products and services is directly related to activity levels and the capital and operating budgets of our customers, which in turn are influenced heavily by energy prices and the expectation as to future trends in those prices. Energy prices have historically been cyclical in nature, as exemplified by the significant decrease in  
  
   23 

oil prices beginning in the middle of 2014, and are affected by a wide range of factors. The decline in energy prices has had a material adverse impact on our earnings during 2016.  Although the extent and duration of the decline in energy prices, and the timing and pace of a recovery, are difficult to predict, we expect current market conditions to have a material adverse impact on our earnings at least through 2016 and into 2017. 
  The table below shows average crude oil and natural gas prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI), United Kingdom Brent crude oil (Brent), and Henry Hub natural gas:  

Average WTI and Brent oil prices were 4% and 9% lower, respectively, in the third quarter of 2016 than in the third quarter of 2015. Average natural gas prices were 4% higher in the third quarter of 2016 than in the prior year period. Primarily as a result of increasing supply and insufficient demand growth, crude oil prices began a significant decline in the second half of 2014 and, as of September 30, 2016, they were 56% less than the peak price in June 2014.  The precipitous decline in oil and natural gas prices since the middle of 2014 has resulted in a significant decrease in exploration and production activity and spending by our customers, causing us to experience a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.  
  Crude oil prices have risen significantly from their lows in February of this year. The recent increase in oil prices and the expectation for stabilization or further strengthening caused an increase in North American drilling and completions activity during the third quarter and an improvement in our inbound orders.  Although the price of oil has risen since the end of the second quarter, it has not recovered to a point sufficient to cause a significant increase in investment activity across the global industry. While there has been some improvement in activity in North America, international and subsea activity has not yet improved. Should the global oversupply of crude oil continue to reduce and oil prices increase further, we believe that we will begin to see an increase in our revenues.  Until then, we expect the significant adverse impact on our results of operations to continue. 

24 

The table below shows the average number of active drilling rigs, based on the weekly Baker Hughes Incorporated rig count, operating by geographic area and drilling for different purposes.  

As a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, the average U.S. rig count decreased 45% from the third quarter of 2015, while the international rig count decreased 17% from the third quarter of 2015. The U.S. rig count declined 71% from 1,811 rigs at the beginning of 2015 to 522 rigs at the end of September 2016. Sequentially the average U.S. rig count increased 14% from the second quarter of 2016, while the international rig count decreased 1% from the second quarter of 2016. A substantial portion of our revenue is impacted by the level of rig activity and the number of wells completed. While the U.S. land rig count has started to recover, it remains low compared to historical norms. 
  The current low energy price environment has caused a steep reduction in activity and spending by our customers since 2014.  Many exploration and production companies, especially those with operations in North America or offshore, curtailed operations, reduced the number of wells being drilled, or chose to defer the completion of wells that have been drilled. The low commodity prices also resulted in a substantial reduction in activity and revenue for energy service companies, resulting in both exploration and production companies and energy service companies significantly reducing their purchases of both capital and consumable equipment from the Company and other equipment manufacturers. This widespread reduction in spending had a negative impact on our financial results and new orders during 2016, and is expected to have a continuing adverse effect into 2017, depending on the timing and pace of an potential recovery in activity.

Results of operations  
  We made one acquisition in the second quarter of   2016   and one acquisition in the first quarter of 2015. For additional information about the second quarter 2016 acquisition, see Note   3   to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report.  
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended     September 30, 2015

Revenue  
  Our revenue for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   $106.7 million  , or   43.6%  , to   $138.3 million   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The changes in revenue by reportable segment consisted of the following:  
  Drilling   Subsea segment     Revenue decreased   $60.0 million  , or   54.1%  , to   $50.8 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of the low level of oil and natural gas drilling and well completions activity and reduced prices for most of our equipment. The U.S. average rig count decreased 45% compared to the prior year period resulting in decreased sales of our drilling equipment products. We also recognized lower revenue compared to the prior year period on our subsea products as investment in offshore oil and natural gas activity has continued to decline.  
  Completions segment     Revenue decreased   $22.1 million  , or   39.7%  , to   $33.5 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in revenue was attributable to decreased well completions activity, primarily in North America, leading to lower sales of our casing and cementing equipment, products sold to pressure pumping service providers and pressure control equipment. We have also lowered pricing on most of our equipment in response to industry conditions. 
  Production   Infrastructure segment     Revenue decreased   $24.8 million  , or   31.4%  , to   $54.0 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales of our surface production equipment to exploration and production operators, and to a lesser extent, lower sales of our valves to the upstream sector. The demand for our midstream and downstream valves has continued to be more resilient. We have also experienced pricing pressure in this segment from increased competition. 
  Segment operating income (loss) and segment operating margin percentage 
  Segment operating income (loss) for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , decreased   $36.1 million   to an operating loss of   $23.7 million   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The segment operating margin percentage is calculated by dividing segment operating income (loss) by revenue for the period. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the segment operating margin percentage was   (17.1)%   compared to the   5.1%   operating margin percentage for   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change in operating margin percentage for each segment is explained as follows: 
  Drilling   Subsea segment     The operating margin percentage for this segment decreased to   (22.3)%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   4.9%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The main driver for this decrease in operating margin percentage is the lower activity levels, which have been compounded by more competitive pricing and have also caused a loss of manufacturing scale efficiencies.  
  Completions segment     The operating margin percentage for this segment decreased to   (15.5)%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   9.7%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The overall decrease in operating margin percentage is due to reduced operating leverage on lower volumes and pricing pressure especially on consumable flow equipment sold to pressure pumping service companies.  Also impacting margins was lower earnings from our investment in Global Tubing, LLC.  
  Production   Infrastructure segment     The operating margin percentage for this segment decreased to   (1.3)%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   8.3%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in operating margin percentage was attributable to pricing pressure on our surface production equipment on lower activity levels, and reduced operating leverage on lower volumes. The operating margins for our valve products have been more resilient as demand for midstream and downstream valves remains steady. 
  Corporate     Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate increased by   $1.4 million  , or   28.3%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The prior year period included the reversal of year-to-date bonus accruals as operating results were lower than incentive targets. Corporate costs include, among other items, payroll related costs for general management and management of finance and administration, legal, human resources and information technology, professional fees for legal, accounting and related services, and marketing costs.  
  
   28 

Other items not included in segment operating income (loss) 
  Several items are not included in segment operating income (loss), but are included in total operating income (loss). These items include transaction expenses and gains and losses from the sale of assets and other. Transaction expenses relate to legal and other advisory costs incurred in acquiring businesses and are not considered to be part of segment operating income (loss). These costs were nominal for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . The gains and losses from sales of assets and other in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included  a loss of $2.1 million related to one of our Texas facilities expected to be sold. 
  Other income and expense  
  Other income and expense includes interest expense and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses. We incurred   $6.7 million   of interest expense during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.7 million   from the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   on lower outstanding indebtedness and lower commitment fees on the  unused portion of our revolving credit line. The foreign exchange transaction gains were   $3.2 million   and   $2.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and are primarily the result of movements in the British pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.  
  Taxes  
  Tax expense (benefit) includes current income taxes expected to be due based on taxable income (loss) to be reported during the periods in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and deferred income taxes based on changes in the tax effect of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes at the beginning and end of the respective periods. The effective tax rate, calculated by dividing total tax expense by income (loss) before income taxes, was   39.6%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   12.2%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   is higher than the comparable period in   2015   primarily due to losses incurred in the United States, which are benefited at a higher statutory tax rate, offset by earnings outside the United States in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates.  
  
   29 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended     September 30, 2015    
  We made one acquisition in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and one acquisition in the   nine months ended      September 30, 2015  . For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note   3   to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report.  

Revenue  
  Our revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   $437.1 million  , or   49.8%  , to   $440.4 million   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The changes in revenue by reportable segment consisted of the following:  
  Drilling   Subsea segment     Revenue decreased   $231.3 million  , or   57.2%  , to   $172.9 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of pricing pressure and decreased oil and natural gas drilling and well completions activity and reduced investments in offshore oil and natural gas projects globally. The U.S. average rig count decreased 54% compared to the prior year period resulting in decreased sales of our drilling equipment products. We also recognized lower revenue compared to the prior year  
  
   30 

period on our subsea products as construction of vessels requiring our workclass remote operated vehicles and associated systems and other offshore projects were delayed. 
  Completions segment     Revenue decreased   $130.1 million  , or   58.5%  , to   $92.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in revenue was attributable to pricing pressure and decreased well completions activity, primarily in North America, leading to lower sales of our casing and cementing equipment, products sold to pressure pumping service providers and pressure control equipment. 
  Production   Infrastructure segment     Revenue decreased   $75.5 million  , or   30.0%  , to   $176.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to pricing pressure and lower sales of our surface production equipment to exploration and production operators, and to a lesser extent, lower sales of our valves to the upstream sector. The demand for our midstream and downstream valves has continued to be more resilient. 
  Segment operating income (loss) and segment operating margin percentage 
  Segment operating income (loss) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , decreased   $176.3 million   to a loss of   $101.3 million   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The segment operating margin percentage is calculated by dividing segment operating income (loss) by revenue for the period. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the segment operating margin percentage was   (23.0)%   compared to the   8.6%   operating margin percentage for   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change in operating margin percentage for each segment is explained as follows: 
  Drilling   Subsea segment     The operating margin percentage decreased to   (24.1)%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   8.8%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 included $10.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of inventory write-downs due to lower activity levels and reduced pricing of our products, and severance and facility closure costs incurred to further reduce our cost structure in line with current activity levels. Excluding these charges, the operating margins were (18.3)% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 10.6% for the comparable period in 2015. The main driver for this decrease in operating margin percentage is the lower activity levels, which have caused a loss of manufacturing scale efficiencies and more intense competition for fewer sales opportunities reducing our prices. We believe that adjusted operating margins excluding the costs described above are useful for investors to assess operating performance especially when comparing periods. 
  Completions segment     The operating margin percentage for this segment decreased to   (43.0)%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   16.5%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 included $20.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of inventory write-downs attributable to lower activity levels and reduced pricing of our products, and facility closure costs incurred to reduce our cost structure in line with current market activity levels. Excluding these charges, the operating margins were (20.7)% for the the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 17.7% for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in operating margin percentage is due to reduced operating leverage on lower volumes and pricing pressure especially on consumable flow equipment sold to pressure pumping service companies.  Also impacting margins was lower earnings from our investment in Global Tubing, LLC. We believe that adjusted operating margins excluding the costs described above are useful for investors to assess operating performance especially when comparing periods. 
  Production   Infrastructure segment     The operating margin percentage decreased to   0.3%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   9.5%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included $3.8 million of costs related to facility consolidation and severance. The decrease in operating margin percentage was attributable to pricing pressure on our surface production equipment on lower activity levels, and reduced operating leverage on lower volumes. The operating margins for our valve products have been more resilient as demand for midstream and downstream valves remains steady. 
  Corporate     Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate decreased by   $0.9 million  , or   4.3%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to lower personnel costs and lower professional fees. Corporate costs include, among other items, payroll related costs for general management and management of finance and administration, legal, human resources and information technology, professional fees for legal, accounting and related services, and marketing costs.

Other items not included in segment operating income (loss) 
  Several items are not included in segment operating income (loss), but are included in total operating income (loss). These items include transaction expenses, and gains and losses from the sale of assets. Transaction expenses relate to legal and other advisory costs incurred in acquiring businesses and are not considered to be part of segment operating income (loss). These costs were   $0.6 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The gains and losses from sales of assets and other in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included a gain of $1.7 million from the sale of a plant, a loss of $1.9 million related to an operation in South Africa expected to be sold, and a loss of $2.1 million related to one of our Texas facilities expected to be sold. 
  Other income and expense  
  Other income and expense includes interest expense and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses. We incurred   $20.7 million   of interest expense during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.0 million   from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   on lower outstanding indebtedness and lower commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit line. The foreign exchange transaction gains were   $14.5 million   and   $5.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 respectively, and are primarily the result of movements in the British pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we wrote off $2.6 million of deferred financing costs as a result of the amendment of our Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2016 which reduced the size of our undrawn revolving credit line. 
  Taxes  
  Tax expense (benefit) includes current income taxes expected to be due based on taxable income (loss) to be reported during the periods in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and deferred income taxes based on changes in the tax effect of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes at the beginning and end of the respective periods. The effective tax rate, calculated by dividing total tax expense by income (loss) before income taxes, was   38.4%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 23.3% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is higher than the comparable period in   2015   primarily due to losses incurred in the United States, which are benefited at a higher statutory tax rate, offset by earnings outside the United States in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates.  
   
  Liquidity and capital resources 
  Sources and uses of liquidity  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $132.5 million   and total debt of   $396.5 million  . We believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations for the foreseeable future. We intend to elect to carry back our 2016 U.S. net operating loss to recover taxes paid in earlier periods, and we expect to receive a tax refund of approximately $33 million in the third quarter 2017.  
  Our total 2016 capital expenditure budget is approximately $20.0 million, which consists of, among other items, investments in maintaining and consolidating certain manufacturing facilities, replacing end of life machinery and equipment, maintaining our rental fleet of subsea equipment, and general capital expenditures. This budget does not include expenditures for potential business acquisitions. 
  Although we do not budget for acquisitions, pursuing growth through acquisitions is a significant part of our business strategy. We expanded and diversified our product portfolio with the acquisition of one business in the second quarter of 2016 for total consideration of   $3.0 million   and one business in the first quarter of 2015 for total consideration of   $61.9 million  .   We used cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Facility to finance these acquisitions. We continue to actively review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis, and we may fund these acquisitions with cash and/or equity. Our ability to make significant additional acquisitions for cash may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which we may not be able to obtain on terms acceptable to us or at all.  
  
   32 

Our cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are presented below (in millions):  

Cash flows provided by operating activities  
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $44.2 million   and   $117.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash provided by operations decreased primarily as a result of lower earnings, offset by positive cash flow resulting from lower investments in working capital. We also have been managing timing of payments to vendors to better align with the receipts from our customers 
  Cash flows used in investing activities  
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $12.4 million   and   $87.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease was primarily due to consideration paid for an acquisition in the second quarter of 2016 of $  2.7 million   compared to   $60.8 million   of consideration paid for an acquisition in the first quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $13.4 million   as compared to   $28.0 million   for the comparable prior period as we have reduced our capital budgets to maintenance levels. 
  Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities  
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $0.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to cash used in financing activities of   $27.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   is primarily due to net repayment of debt of $26.0 million and   $4.6 million   of proceeds from stock issuances, offset by   $6.2 million   of repurchases of stocks in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Senior Notes Due 2021 
  The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.250% per annum, payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, and mature on October 1, 2021. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility and rank junior to, among other indebtedness, the Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Credit Facility.  
  Credit Facility 
  On February 25, 2016, the Company amended its senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Facility" and such amendment, the "Amended Facility") to reduce commitment fees and provide borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes. The Amended Facility provides for a revolving credit line of up to   $200.0 million  , including up to   $25.0 million   available for letters of credit and up to   $10.0 million   in swingline loans. Availability under the Amended Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to eligible accounts receivable in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, eligible inventory in the United States, and cash on hand.  
  The Amended Facility reduced our borrowing capacity from   $600.0 million   to   $200.0 million  . Accordingly, the Company has written off $  2.6 million   of the deferred financing costs related to the Credit Facility.  
  There have been no changes to the Credit Facility financial covenants disclosed in Item 7 of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by Exhibit 99.3 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants. We had   no   borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility, and we had   $17.3 million   of outstanding letters of credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the capacity to borrow an additional   $108.0 million   subject to certain limitations in the Credit Facility. If our adjusted EBITDA levels (as defined in the Amended Facility) do not increase in future quarters, our borrowing capacity under the Amended Facility could be reduced or eliminated.  
  
   33 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet instruments or financial arrangements, other than operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business. 
  Contractual obligations  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by Exhibit 99.3 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2016. 
  Critical accounting policies and estimates 
  There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and procedures during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . For a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by Exhibits 99.3 and 99.4 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2016.  
  Recent accounting pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15 Cash Flow Statement (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice, including: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  The only issue currently relevant to us is distributions received from equity method investees, where the new guidance allows an accounting policy election between the cumulative earnings approach and the nature distribution approach. We will continue to use the cumulative earnings approach, therefore the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates No. 2014-09 and No. 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting. This new guidance rescinded certain SEC staff observer comments in Topic 605 related to revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process and accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, in Topic 932 related to gas-balancing arrangements, and in Topic 815 related to the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid instrument issued in the form of a share. ASU 2016-11 is effective upon adoption of Topic 606 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued a series of ASUs on revenue standards, including No. 2016-08 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations, No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and No. 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. ASU No. 2016-08 amended the guidance in the new revenue standard on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU No. 2016-10 amended and clarified the guidance in the new revenue standard on identifying performance obligation and accounting for licenses of intellectual property and addressed the implementation issues.  ASU No. 2016-12 amended and updated only the narrow aspects of Topic 606.  The above standards will take effect for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the above guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This new guidance includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements: a)  All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement; b) Excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity; c) An entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur; d) The threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions; e) Cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes  
  
   34 

should be classified as a financing activity. There are also two additional provisions for non-public entities that do not apply to us. The standard will take effect for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.  Under this new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than twelve months. The standard will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance.  
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern. The new standard requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt as to an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for both annual and interim reporting periods. The guidance is effective for the Company for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The new standard is to be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies are able to early adopt the pronouncement, however not before fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the adoption and the implementation approach to be used.  
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
  We are currently exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency and changes in interest rates. From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce our market risk, but we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.  
  There have been no significant changes to our market risk since   December 31, 2015  . For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7(a),  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by Exhibit 99.3 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2016. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS)

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.1 
    
          FORUM ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
   2016 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  2016 EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
  This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this    Agreement   ) is made as of the [   ] day of [    ], 2016 (the    Date of Grant   ), between Forum Energy Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), and _________________ (the    Employee   ).  
  1.  Award  .  Pursuant to the Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. 2016 Stock and Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ), the Employee is hereby awarded   [              ]   units (the    RSUs   ) evidencing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company s common stock, par value $.01 per share (the    Common Stock   ), subject to certain restrictions thereon.  The Employee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan, and agrees that this award of RSUs shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions of the Plan, including future amendments thereto, if any, pursuant to the terms thereof.  Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Plan.   
    
  2.  Forfeiture Restrictions and Assignment  .  
    
  (a)  Restrictions  .  The RSUs may not be sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred, encumbered or disposed of, and except as otherwise provided in Section 3, in the event of the Employee s termination of employment for any reason whatsoever, the Employee shall, for no consideration, forfeit all unvested RSUs.  The obligation to forfeit unvested RSUs upon termination of employment as provided in the preceding sentence is herein referred to as the    Forfeiture Restrictions  .   
    
  (b)  Lapse of Forfeiture Restrictions  .  Provided that the Employee has been continuously employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates (collectively, the    Company Group   ) from the Date of Grant through the lapse date set forth in the following schedule, the Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse and the RSUs shall otherwise become vested with respect to a percentage of the RSUs determined in accordance with the following schedule: 
                   Vesting Date 
      
    Additional Percentage of Total Number of RSUs Vesting on Vesting Date 
      First Anniversary of Date of Grant 
      
    25% 
      Second Anniversary of Date of Grant 
      
    25% 
      Third Anniversary of Date of Grant 
      
    25% 
      Fourth Anniversary of Date of Grant 
      
    25% 

Except as otherwise provided in Section 3, any RSUs with respect to which the Forfeiture Restrictions do not lapse in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section 2(b) shall be forfeited to the Company for no consideration as of the date of the termination of the Employee s employment with the Company. 
  3.  Termination of Employment  .   
    
  (a)  Death or Disability  .  If the Employee dies or becomes Disabled (as defined below), to the extent not previously vested pursuant to Section 2(a) above, each quarter of the RSUs described in Section 2(a) that are unvested as of the date of the Employee s death or Disability, as applicable, shall become vested in a pro rata amount determined by a fraction with respect to each unvested quarter of the RSUs, the numerator of which shall be the number of months (not including any partial months) that have elapsed for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date of the Employee s death or Disability, as applicable, and the denominator of which shall be the number of months for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the corresponding anniversary of the date on which each such unvested quarter of the RSUs would have vested pursuant to Section 2(a).  Any remaining unvested RSUs shall  

be forfeited.  The shares of Common Stock in respect of the vested RSUs shall be issued to the Employee thirty (30) days after the Employee s     death or Disability, as applicable.  For purposes of this Section 3(a), an Employee shall become    Disabled    or have a    Disability    on the date that the Employee becomes eligible for long-term disability benefits pursuant to the Company s long-term disability plan. 
    
  (b)  Retirement  .  If the Employee s employment with the Company Group is terminated by reason of Retirement (as defined below), to the extent not previously vested pursuant to Section 2(a) above, each quarter of the RSUs described in Section 2(a) that are unvested as of the date of the Employee s Retirement shall become vested in a pro rata amount determined by a fraction with respect to each unvested quarter of the RSUs, the numerator of which shall be the number of months (not including any partial months) that have elapsed for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date of the Employee s Retirement, and the denominator of which shall be the number of months for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the corresponding anniversary of the date on which each such unvested quarter of the RSUs would have vested pursuant to Section 2(a).  The shares of Common Stock in respect of the vested RSUs shall be issued to the Employee thirty (30) days after the date of the Employee s     Retirement.  For purposes of this Section 3(b),    Retirement    shall mean termination of the Employee s service relationship with all members of the Company Group which is specifically determined by the Committee to constitute Retirement. 
    
  (c)  Change in Control  .  If a Change in Control occurs and, on or within two years after the date of consummation of such Change in Control, the Employee s employment with the Company Group is terminated involuntarily by the Company Group without Cause (as defined below) or by the Employee for Good Reason (as defined below), then any unvested RSUs held by the Employee at the time of the Employee s termination of employment shall become fully vested and exercisable and all Forfeiture Restrictions shall immediately lapse.  The shares of Common Stock in respect of the vested RSUs shall be issued to the Employee thirty (30) days after the date of the Employee s termination of employment.  For purposes of this Section 3(c),    Cause    shall mean a determination by the Company that the Employee has engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of the Employee s duties with respect to the Company or any of its Affiliates; has materially breached any provision of any written agreement or corporate policy or code of conduct established by the Company or any of its Affiliates; has willfully engaged in conduct that is materially injurious to the Company or any of its Affiliates; or has been convicted of, pleaded no contest to or received adjudicated probation or deferred adjudication in connection with a felony involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude (or a crime of similar import in a foreign jurisdiction).  For purposes of this Section 3(c),    Good Reason    shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events without the Employee s consent: (i) a material reduction in the Employee s base rate of compensation from that in effect prior to the Change in Control, (ii) a material diminution in the Employee s authority, duties or responsibilities from those in effect prior to the Change in Control or (iii) the involuntary relocation of the geographic location of the Employee s principal place of employment by more than 75 miles from the location of the Employee s principal place of employment prior to the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assertion by the Employee of a termination of employment for Good Reason shall not be effective unless: (x) the Employee provides written notice to the Company of such condition within 45 days of the initial existence of the condition; (y) the condition specified in such notice must remain uncorrected for 30 days after receipt of such notice by the Company; and (z) the date of the Employee s termination of employment must occur within 90 days after the initial existence of the condition specified in such notice. 
    
  4.  Settlement and Delivery of Stock  .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 2(b) or 3, settlement of RSUs shall be made with 15 days after the lapse of Forfeiture Restrictions.  Settlement will be made by issuance of shares of Common Stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock if counsel to the Company determines that such sale or delivery would violate any applicable law or any rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any rule or regulation of, or agreement of the Company with, any securities exchange or association upon which the Common Stock is listed or quoted.  The Company shall in no event be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the issuance of shares of Common Stock to comply with any such law, rule, regulation or agreement. 
    
  5.  Shareholder Rights  .  The Employee shall have no rights to dividends or other rights of a shareholder with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to this award of RSUs unless and until such time as the award has been settled by the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Employee.  The Employee shall have the right to receive a cash dividend equivalent payment with respect to the RSUs for the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date the shares of Common Stock are issued to the Employee in settlement of the RSUs, which shall be payable at the same time as cash dividends on Common Stock are paid to Company stockholders. 

6.  Corporate Acts  .  The existence of the RSUs shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company s capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of debt or equity securities, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or any part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding.  The prohibitions of Section 2(a) hereof shall not apply to the transfer of RSUs pursuant to a plan of reorganization of the Company, but the stock, securities or other property received in exchange therefor shall also become subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions.   
    
  7.  Withholding of Tax  . To the extent that the settlement of RSUs results in compensation income or wages to the Employee for federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes, the Company shall withhold an appropriate number of shares of Common Stock, having a Fair Market Value determined in accordance with the Plan, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligation with respect to the settled RSUs.  The issuance of shares of Common Stock described in Section 4 will be net of such shares of Common Stock that are withheld to satisfy applicable taxes pursuant to this Section 7.  In lieu of withholding of shares of Common Stock, the Committee may, in its discretion, authorize tax withholding to be satisfied by a cash payment to the Company, by withholding an appropriate amount of cash from base pay, or by such other method as the Committee determines may be appropriate to satisfy all obligations for withholding of such taxes.  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company is making no representation or warranty as to the tax consequences to the Employee as a result of the receipt of the RSUs, the lapse of any Forfeiture Restrictions or the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, or the forfeiture of any RSUs pursuant to the Forfeiture Restrictions.  
    
  8.  Employment Relationship  . For purposes of this Agreement, the Employee shall be considered to be in the employment of the Company as long as the Employee remains an employee of the Company Group. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, it is specifically provided that the Employee shall be considered to have terminated employment with the Company Group at the time of the termination of the  Affiliate  status of the entity or other organization that employs the Employee. Nothing in the adoption of the Plan, nor the award of the RSUs thereunder pursuant to this Agreement, shall confer upon the Employee the right to continued employment by the Company Group or affect in any way the right of the Company Group to terminate such employment at any time. Unless otherwise provided in a written employment agreement or by applicable law, the Employee s employment by the Company shall be on an at-will basis, and the employment relationship may be terminated at any time by either the Employee or the Company Group for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause or notice. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate, and its determination shall be final.  
    
  9.  Section 409A  .  The award of RSUs is intended to be (i) exempt from Section 409A of the Code (   Section 409A   ) including, but not limited to, by reason of compliance with the short-term deferral exemption as specified in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(4); or (ii) in compliance with Section 409A, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and construed accordingly.  If the Employee is identified by the Company as a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code on the date on which the Employee has a  separation from service  (other than due to death) within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2 or 3 hereof, any transfer of shares payable on account of a separation from service that are deferred compensation shall take place on the earlier of (i) the first business day following the expiration of six months from the Employee s separation from service or (ii) such earlier date as complies with the requirements of Section 409A.  To the extent required to comply with Section 409A, the Employee shall be considered to have terminated employment with the Company Group when the Employee incurs a  separation from service  with a member of the Company Group within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code.  The Company makes no commitment or guarantee to the Employee that any federal or state tax treatment shall apply or be available to any person eligible for benefits under this Agreement.  
    
  10.  Binding Effect; Survival  .  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors to the Company and all persons lawfully claiming under the Employee.   
    
  11.  Amendment  .  Any modification of this Agreement shall be effective only if it is in writing and signed by both the Employee and an authorized officer of the Company.  
    
  12.  Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF,   the Company has caused this Agreement to be duly executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized, and the Employee has executed this Agreement, all as of the date first above written.
