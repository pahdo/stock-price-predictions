1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meredith Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries (Meredith or the Company), after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions. Meredith does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. The Company's use of special-purpose entities is limited to Meredith Funding Corporation, whose activities are fully consolidated in Meredith's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for complete financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in Meredith's Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , filed with the SEC. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are unaudited but, in management's opinion, include all normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of   June 30, 2016  , were derived from audited financial statements, but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year. 
    
  Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new standard requires that debt issuance costs be recorded as a reduction from the face amount of the related debt rather than recorded as a deferred asset, with amortization recorded as interest expense, rather than recording as a deferred asset. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and it was retrospectively applied to the prior period, as required. Adoption changed the classification of debt issuance costs from other assets to current portion of long-term debt or long-term debt based on the classification of the related debt instrument. As a result, other assets and long-term debt each decreased by   $1.5 million   as of June 30, 2016, compared to amounts previously reported. Additionally, the format of the long-term debt disclosure was updated to include debt issuance costs separately. The adoption did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of cloud computing arrangements that include a software license. The new guidance requires capitalization of the software license fee as internal-use software if certain criteria are met, otherwise the costs are expensed as incurred. The standard was prospectively adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of the standard had no impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that made technical corrections to the   FASB Accounting Standards Codification.   These technical corrections are divided into four categories: amendments related to differences between original guidance and the codification, guidance clarification and reference corrections, minor structural changes to simplify the codification, and minor improvements that are not expected to have a significant impact on current accounting practice. The amendments were effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of the amendments had no impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

6 

Pending Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update clarifying the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The update is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. Retrospective adoption is required in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this update will have on its consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption. 

2.  Inventories 
    
  Major components of inventories are summarized below. Of total net inventory values shown,   51 percent     are under the last-in first-out (LIFO) method at     September 30, 2016  , and     54 percent     at     June 30, 2016  . 

3.  Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
    
  Intangible assets consist of the following: 

7 

Amortization expense was   $4.8 million   and   $4.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Annual amortization expense for intangible assets is expected to be as follows:   $18.0 million   in   fiscal 2017  ,   $15.0 million   in fiscal   2018  ,   $12.5 million   in fiscal   2019  ,   $11.6 million   in fiscal   2020  , and   $7.6 million   in fiscal   2021  . 
    
  Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: 

4.  Restructuring Accrual 
    
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, management committed to a performance improvement plan that included selected workforce reductions. In connection with this plan, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling   $3.4 million   for severance and related benefit costs related to the involuntary termination of employees. The plan affected approximately   45   employees. The Company also recorded   $1.1 million   in reversals of excess restructuring reserves accrued in prior fiscal years. The severance and related benefit costs and the credits for the reversal of excess restructuring reserves are recorded in the selling, general, and administrative line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
    
  Details of changes in the Company's restructuring accrual are as follows: 

8 

5.  Long-term Debt 
    
  Long-term debt consists of the following: 

In connection with the asset-backed bank facility, Meredith entered into a revolving agreement to sell all of its rights, title, and interest in the majority of its accounts receivable related to advertising and miscellaneous revenues to Meredith Funding Corporation, a special-purpose entity established to purchase accounts receivable from Meredith. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $169.1 million   of accounts receivable net of reserves was outstanding under the agreement. Meredith Funding Corporation in turn may sell receivable interests to a major national bank. In consideration of the sale, Meredith receives cash and a subordinated note, bearing interest at the prime rate,   3.50 percent   at   September 30, 2016  , from Meredith Funding Corporation. The agreement is structured as a true sale under which the creditors of Meredith Funding Corporation will be entitled to be satisfied out of the assets of Meredith Funding Corporation prior to any value being returned to Meredith or its creditors. The accounts of Meredith Funding Corporation are fully consolidated in Meredith's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The Company holds interest rate swap agreements to hedge variable interest rate risk on the   $250.0 million   floating-rate senior notes and on   $50.0 million   of the term loan. The expiration of the swaps is as follows:    $50.0 million   in August 2018,   $100.0 million   in March 2019, and   $150.0 million   in August 2019. Under the swaps the Company will pay fixed rates of interest (  1.36 percent   on the swap maturing in August 2018,   1.53 percent   on the swap maturing in March 2019, and   1.76 percent   on the swaps maturing in August 2019) and receive variable rates of interest based on the one to three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (  0.54 percent   on the swap maturing in August 2018,   0.86 percent   on the swap maturing in March 2019, and   0.84 percent   on the swaps maturing in August 2019 as of   September 30, 2016  ) on the   $300.0 million   notional amount of indebtedness. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the hedging relationships on an ongoing basis by recalculating changes in fair value of the derivatives and related hedged items independently. 
    
  Unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent the cash flow hedges are effective. The amount of the swap that offsets the effects of interest rate changes on the related debt is subsequently reclassified into interest expense. Any ineffective portions on cash flow hedges are recorded in interest expense. No material ineffectiveness existed at either   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount the Company would pay or receive to terminate the swap agreements. At   September 30, 2016  , the swaps had a fair value of   $4.9 million   liability. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the swap  
  
    9 

agreements. This exposure is managed through diversification and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. There was   no   potential loss that the Company would incur on the interest rate swaps if the counterparties were to fail to meet their obligations under the agreements at   September 30, 2016  . Given the strong creditworthiness of the counterparties, management does not expect any of them to fail to meet their obligations. Additionally, the concentration of risk with any individual counterparty is not considered significant at   September 30, 2016  . 

6.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans 
    
  The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs: 

The amortization of amounts related to unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial gain/loss was reclassified out of other comprehensive income as components of net periodic benefit costs. 

7.  Earnings per Share 
    
  The following table presents the calculations of earnings per share: 

10 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , antidilutive options excluded from the above calculations totaled   0.5 million   (with a weighted average exercise price of   $54.11  ) and   1.2 million   (with a weighted average exercise price of   $49.47  ), respectively. 

8.  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We estimated the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts we would realize upon disposition. 
    
  The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, which are described below: 

Level 1 
    Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
        
    Level 2 
    Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable  ; 
        
    Level 3 
    Assets or liabilities for which fair value is based on valuation models with significant unobservable pricing inputs and which result in the use of management estimates. 

The following table sets forth the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The fair value of broadcast rights payable was determined using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the Company's current borrowing rate with inputs included in Level 3. The fair value of total long-term debt was determined using the present value of expected future cash flows using borrowing rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities with inputs included in Level 2. 
    
  The following table sets forth the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flows derived from market observable inputs including swap curves that are included in Level 2. The fair values of contingent consideration and corporate airplanes are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents Level 3 measurements. 
  
    11 

Details of changes in the fair value of Level 3 contingent consideration and corporate airplanes are as follows:

       (2)        Consistent with the decision to sell the corporate airplanes, these assets were adjusted to fair value in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 

9.  Financial Information about Industry Segments 
    
  Meredith is a diversified media company focused primarily on the home and family marketplace. On the basis of products and services, the Company has established   two   reportable segments: national media and local media. There have been no changes in the basis of segmentation since   June 30, 2016  . There have been no material intersegment transactions. 
    
  There are   two   principal financial measures reported to the chief executive officer for use in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. Those measures are operating profit and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Operating profit for segment reporting, disclosed below, is revenues less operating costs excluding unallocated corporate expenses. Segment operating expenses include allocations of certain centrally incurred costs such as employee benefits, occupancy, information systems, accounting services, internal legal staff, and human resources administration. These costs are allocated based on actual usage or other appropriate methods, primarily number of employees. Unallocated corporate expenses are corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to the operating groups. In accordance with authoritative guidance on disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, EBITDA is not presented below.

Item 2. 
    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon management's current expectations and are subject to various uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth below under the heading  Forward Looking Statements." 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  Meredith Corporation has been committed to service journalism for nearly 115 years. Today, Meredith uses multiple distribution platforms including broadcast television, print, digital, mobile, tablets, and video to provide consumers with content they desire and to deliver the messages of its advertising and marketing partners. 
    
  Meredith operates two business segments:  local media and national media. The local media segment includes 17 owned or operated television stations reaching 11 percent of United States (U.S.) households. Meredith s portfolio is concentrated in large, fast-growing markets, with seven stations in the nation s Top 25 markets including Atlanta, Phoenix, St. Louis, and Portland and 13 in Top 50 markets. Meredith s stations produce nearly 700 hours of local news and entertainment content each week, and operate leading local digital destinations.  
    
  Our national media segment reaches 100 million unduplicated women and nearly 75 percent of American millennial women. Meredith is the leader at creating content across media platforms in key consumer interest areas such as food, home, parenthood, and health through well-known brands such as Better Homes and Gardens, Allrecipes, Parents, Shape, and EatingWell. The national media segment features robust brand licensing activities, including more than 3,000 SKUs of branded products at 4,000 Walmart stores across the U.S. Meredith Xcelerated Marketing (MXM) is a leader at developing and delivering custom content and customer relationship marketing programs for many of the world s top brands. 
    
  Both segments operate primarily in the U.S. and compete against similar media and other types of media on both a local and national basis. The national media segment accounted for   62 percent   of the Company's   $399.9 million   in revenues in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   while the local media segment contributed   38 percent  . 

LOCAL MEDIA 
    
  Local media derives the majority of its revenues   66 percent   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   from the sale of advertising, both over the air and on our stations' websites and apps. The remainder comes from television retransmission fees, station operation management fees, and other services. Political advertising revenues are cyclical in that they are significantly greater during biennial election campaigns (which take place primarily in odd-numbered fiscal years) than at other times. Local media's major expense categories are employee compensation costs and programming fees paid to the networks. 

NATIONAL MEDIA 
    
  Advertising revenues represented   51 percent   of national media's first   three months  ' revenues. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in our magazines and on our websites and apps to clients interested in promoting their brands, products, and services to consumers. Circulation revenues accounted for   28 percent   of national media's first   three months  ' revenues. Circulation revenues result from the sale of magazines to consumers  
  
    14 

through subscriptions and by single copy sales on newsstands in print form, primarily at major retailers and grocery/drug stores, and in digital form on tablets and other media devices. The remaining   21 percent   of national media's revenues came from a variety of activities which included the sale of customer relationship marketing products and services as well as brand licensing, product sales, and other related activities. National media's major expense categories are production and delivery of publications and promotional mailings and employee compensation costs. 

FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2017 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW 

Local media revenues increased   21 percent   and operating profit rose   73 percent   compared to the prior-year period reflecting higher retransmission revenues and increased cyclical political advertising. 

National media revenues declined   4 percent   compared to the prior-year period as declines in the revenues of our magazine operations of $12.6 million and our brand licensing operations of $2.0 million more than offset increased revenues in our digital operations of $4.8 million. Approximately 30 percent of the decline in magazine operation revenues was due to the closure of MORE magazine effective following the April 2016 issue. National media operating profit increased   6 percent   as improved operating results in our digital operations of $4.4 million and a lower severance and benefits accrual of $3.2 million compared to the prior-year period more than offset decreases in the operating profit of our brand licensing operations of $2.5 million, our MXM operations of $1.9 million, and our magazine operations of $1.7 million. 

Diluted earnings per share increased   213 percent   to   $0.75   from   $0.24   in the prior-year first   three months  . Prior year earnings per share was impacted by merger-related expenses incurred by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following sections provide an analysis of the results of operations for the local media and national media segments and an analysis of the consolidated results of operations for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the prior-year period. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and with our Annual Report on Form 10 K (Form 10 K) for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . 

15 

LOCAL MEDIA 
    
  Local media operating results were as follows: 

Revenues 
  Local media revenues increased   21 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  . Political advertising revenues totaled   $16.4 million   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   compared with   $2.1 million   in the prior-year   first quarter  . Fluctuations in political advertising revenues at our stations and throughout the broadcasting industry generally follow the biennial cycle of election campaigns. Political advertising displaces a certain amount of non-political advertising; therefore, the revenues are not entirely incremental. Non-political advertising revenues decreased   6 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  . Local non-political advertising revenues declined 6 percent in the   first quarter   while national non-political advertising revenues decreased 8 percent for this period. Digital advertising, a component of non-political advertising revenues, increased more than 20 percent in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   as a series of growth strategies continued to drive higher advertising rates across the station group. 
    
  Other revenues grew   49 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   primarily due to increased retransmission fees. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
  Local media operating expenses increased   5 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   primarily due to higher programming fees paid to affiliated networks. 
    
  Operating Profit 
  Local media operating profit increased   73 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   primarily due to increases in higher-margin retransmission and political advertising revenues in the quarter. 

NATIONAL MEDIA 
    
  National media operating results were as follows:

  National media advertising revenues decreased   1 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  . Digital advertising revenues grew 15 percent in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  . Magazine advertising revenues decreased 7 percent, primarily the result of mix changes, and advertising pages decreased 1 percent in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  . Among our core advertising categories, the prescription drug, food, and direct response categories showed strength while demand was weaker for the toiletries and cosmetics, household supplies, and non-prescription drug categories. 
    
  Magazine circulation revenues decreased   5 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  . Subscription revenues decreased in the high-single digits in the   first quarter  . Newsstand revenues increased in the mid-single digits in the   first quarter  . Subscription revenues declined due primarily to a reduction in the frequency of   Family Fun   magazine resulting in one less issue in the quarter, the closure of   MORE   magazine effective following the April 2016 issue, and ongoing efforts to source magazine subscribers from Meredith s own database instead of external agent sources. This direct-to-publisher strategy increases circulation profit but lowers revenues over time. The closing of   MORE   magazine and the direct-to-publisher strategy are expected to affect subscription revenues throughout fiscal 2017. 
    
  Other revenues decreased   9 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   primarily due to a decline in brand licensing revenues of $2.0 million due to the renewal of certain contracts impacting the timing of revenues. In addition, in our magazine operations, decreases of book sales of $1.6 million and of marketing and print services of $1.2 million also contributed to the decline. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
  National media operating expenses decreased   5 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   primarily due to declines in circulation expenses of $3.8 million, severance and related benefit accruals of $3.2 million, postage and other delivery costs of $2.5 million, non-payroll related editorial costs of $2.1 million, paper expenses of $2.0 million, and processing costs of $1.5 million. The closing of   MORE   magazine contributed to these declines. Paper expense also decreased due to a mid-single digit decline in average paper prices as compared to the year-ago period. These decreases more than offset an increase in accrued contingent consideration expense of $1.7 million. The increase accrued contingent consideration expense is primarily due to there being a credit balance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. 
    
  Operating Profit 
  National media operating profit increased   6 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   as growth in the operating profit of our digital operations of $4.4 million and lower severance and benefits expense of $3.2 million more than offset declines in the operating profit of our brand licensing operations of $2.5 million, MXM's operations of $1.9 million, and our magazine operations of $1.7 million. 

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES 
    
  Unallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not attributable to the operating groups. These expenses were as follows: 

Unallocated corporate costs and expenses increased   34 percent   as compared to the prior-year first quarter primarily due to increases in performance-based incentive accruals of $2.4 million and consulting costs of $0.9 million. 
  
    17 

In September 2015, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Media General, Inc. This agreement was terminated in January 2016. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company incurred   $12.7 million   in merger-related expenses. 

CONSOLIDATED 
    
  Consolidated Operating Expenses 
  Consolidated operating expenses were as follows: 

Fiscal 2017   production, distribution, and editorial costs decreased   2 percent   in the   first quarter   as compared to the prior-year period. For the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , declines in postage and other delivery costs of $2.5 million, employee compensation costs of $2.2 million, non-payroll related editorial costs of $2.1 million, paper expenses of $2.0 million, and processing costs of $1.5 million more than offset an increase in programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $4.3 million. 
    
  Selling, general, and administrative expenses were flat in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  . For the   first quarter  , increased performance based incentive accruals of $3.8 million, and the reversal, in the prior year, of previously accrued restructuring costs of $1.1 million more than offset declines in circulation expenses of $3.8 million and lower severance and related benefit accruals of $3.4 million. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense declined   8 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   primarily due to decreases in depreciation in our local media segment. 
    
  In September 2015, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Media General, Inc. This agreement was terminated in January 2016. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company incurred   $12.7 million   in merger-related expenses. 
    
  Income from Operations 
  Income from operations increased   109 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   primarily due to the lack of   $12.7 million   of merger-related expenses as compared to the prior-year quarter and higher operating profits in our local media segment of $21.3 million. 
    
  Net Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense decreased to   $4.7 million   in the   fiscal 2017     first quarter   compared with   $5.3 million   in the prior-year   first quarter  . Average long-term debt outstanding was $693.4 million in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   compared with $807.3 million in the prior-year   first quarter  . The Company's approximate weighted average interest rate was 2.8 percent in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   and 2.6 percent in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2016  . The weighted average interest rates include the effects of derivative financial instruments. 
    
  Income Taxes 
  Our effective tax rate was   39.3 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   as compared to   53.5 percent   in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  . The fiscal 2016 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily impacted by anticipated  
  
    18 

limitations on the tax deductibility of certain merger-related expenses incurred prior to the termination of the merger agreement. 
    
  Net Earnings and Earnings per Share 
  Net earnings were   $34.0 million   (  $0.75   per diluted share) in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , up   208 percent   from   $11.0 million   (  $0.24   per diluted share) in the prior-year   first quarter  . The increases in net earnings were primarily due to the higher income from operations and a lower effective tax rate as discussed above. Average basic shares outstanding decreased slightly and average diluted shares outstanding increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

OVERVIEW 
    
  Meredith's primary source of liquidity is cash generated by operating activities. Debt financing is typically used for significant acquisitions. We expect cash on hand, internally generated cash flow, and available credit from financing agreements will provide adequate funds for operating and recurring cash needs (e.g., working capital, capital   expend  itures, debt repayments, and cash dividends) into the foreseeable future. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had up to   $150.0 million   of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and up to   $20.0 million   of additional available borrowings under our asset-backed bank facility (depending on levels of accounts rece  ivable). While t  here are no guarantees that we will be able to replace current credit agreements when they expire, we expect to be able to do so. 
    
  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents increased   $7.2 million   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   compared to   $7.1 million   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2016  . 
    
  Operating Activities 
  The largest single component of operating cash inflows is cash received from advertising customers. Other sources of operating cash inflows include cash received from magazine circulation sales and other revenue generating transactions such as customer relationship marketing, retransmission consent fees, brand licensing, and product sales. Operating cash outflows include payments to vendors and employees and payments of interest and income taxes. Our most significant vendor payments are for production and delivery of publications and promotional mailings, broadcasting programming rights, employee benefit plans (including pension plans), and other services and supplies. 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities totaled   $35.4 million   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   compared with   $2.8 million   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2016  . The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increased net earnings. 

19 

Investing Activities 
  Investing cash inflows generally include proceeds from the sale of assets or a business. Investing cash outflows generally include payments for the acquisition of new businesses; investments; and additions to property, plant, and equipment. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities increased to   $2.2 million   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   from   $0.1 million   in the prior-year period. Meredith received proceeds from the sale of assets in fiscal 2016. No such sales occurred in fiscal 2017. 
    
  Financing Activities 
  Financing cash inflows generally include borrowings under debt agreements and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options issued under share-based compensation plans. Financing cash outflows generally include the repayment of long-term debt, the payment of dividends, and repurchases of Company stock. 
    
  Net cash used by financing activities totaled   $26.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with net cash provided by financing activities of   $4.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The change in cash flows from financing activities is primarily due to a net $3.8 million of debt being issued in the current-year period compared to a net $24.3 million of debt being issued in the prior-year period. In addition, the Company spent an additional $12.6 million for purchases of Company stock in the current quarter. 
    
  Long-term Debt 
  At   September 30, 2016  , long-term debt outstanding totaled   $698.8 million  . The balance consisted of   $218.8 million   under a term loan,   $100.0 million   in fixed-rate unsecured senior notes,   $250.0 million   in floating-rate unsecured senior notes,   $80.0 million   under an asset-backed bank facility, and   $50.0 million   outstanding under a revolving credit facility. 
    
  The Company holds interest rate swap agreements to hedge variable interest rate risk on the   $250.0 million   floating-rate senior notes and on   $50.0 million   of the term loan. The expiration of the swaps is as follows:    $50.0 million   in August 2018,   $100.0 million   in March 2019, and   $150.0 million   in August 2019. Under the swaps the Company will pay fixed rates of interest (  1.36   percent on the swap maturing in August 2018,   1.53 percent   on the swap maturing in March 2019, and   1.76   percent on the swaps maturing in August 2019) and receive variable rates of interest based on the one to three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (  0.54   percent on the swap maturing in August 2018,   0.86 percent   on the swap maturing in March 2019, and   0.84   percent on the swaps maturing in August 2019 as of   September 30, 2016  ) on the   $300.0 million   notional amount of indebtedness. 
    
  The revolving credit facility has a capacity of up to $200.0 million. Both the revolving credit facility and the term loan have a five-year term which expires in March 2019. The interest rate under both the revolving credit facility and the term loan is variable based on LIBOR and Meredith's debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as defined in the debt agreement) ratio. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments based on an amortization schedule as set forth in the agreement. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $218.8 million   was outstanding under the term loan and   $50.0 million   was outstanding under the revolver. Of the term loan, $25.0 million is due in the next 12 months. We expect to repay this with cash from operations and credit available under existing credit agreements. 
    
  Of the fixed-rate unsecured senior notes,   $50.0 million   is due in the next 12 months. We expect to repay these senior notes with cash from operations and credit available under existing credit agreements. The weighted average effective interest rate for the fixed-rate notes was 3.04 percent at   September 30, 2016  . The floating-rate unsecured senior notes are due in December 2022 and February 2024. The weighted average effective interest rate for $150.0 million of the floating-rate unsecured senior notes was 3.26 percent at   September 30, 2016  , after taking into account the effect of outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The weighted average effective interest rate for $100.0 million of the floating-rate unsecured senior notes was 3.03 percent at   September 30, 2016  , after taking into account the effect of the outstanding interest rate swap agreement. None of the floating-rate senior notes are due in the next 12 months. The interest rate on the asset-backed bank facility is variable based on LIBOR plus a fixed spread. As of  
  
    20 

September 30, 2016  , the asset-backed bank facility had a capacity of up to $100.0 million (depending on levels of accounts receivable). The asset-backed bank facility expires in October 2017. 
    
  All of our debt agreements include financial covenants, and failure to comply with any such covenants could result in the debt becoming payable on demand. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there had been no material changes in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Form 10 K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  Merger-Related Expenses 
  In September 2015, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Media General, Inc. This agreement was terminated in January 2016. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company incurred   $12.7 million   in merger-related expenses. 
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
  As part of our ongoing share repurchase program, we spent   $18.4 million   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   to repurchase 340,000 shares of common stock at then-current market prices. We spent   $5.7 million   to repurchase 122,000 shares in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2016  . We expect to continue repurchasing shares from time to time subject to market conditions. Shares that are deemed to be delivered to us on tender of stock in payment for the exercise price of options do not reduce the repurchase authority granted by our Board of Directors. Of the 340,000 shares of common stock purchased during the first   three months   of the current fiscal year, 230,000 were deemed to be delivered to us on tender of stock in payment for the exercise price of options. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $78.2 million   remained available under the current authorization for future repurchases. The status of the repurchase program is reviewed at each quarterly Board of Directors meeting. See Part II, Item 2 (c),   Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities  , of this Form 10 Q for detailed information on share repurchases during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Dividends 
  Dividends paid in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   totaled   $22.4 million  , or   $0.4950   per share, compared with dividend payments of   $20.7 million  , or   $0.4575   per share, in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2016  . 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
  Investment in property, plant, and equipment totaled   $2.2 million   in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   compared with prior-year first   three months  ' investment of   $1.8 million  . Current year and prior year investment spending primarily relate to assets acquired in the normal course of business. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We expect funds for future capital expenditures to come from operating activities or, if necessary, borrowings under existing credit agreements. 

OTHER MATTERS 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Meredith's critical accounting policies are summarized in our Form 10 K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's critical accounting policies had not changed from   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company has a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that are reviewed at least annually for impairment. At   September 30, 2016  , goodwill and intangible assets totaled   $1.8 billion   with   $1.0 billion   in the national media group and   $0.8 billion   in the local media group. Management is required to evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value exceeds the fair value. See Item 1A.   Risk Factors   and    
  
    21 

Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , for additional information. 
    
  ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS 
    
  There were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on applicable accounting pronouncements that were adopted in the first   three months   of   fiscal 2017   or will be effective in future periods. 
    
  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted by such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and estimates of factors affecting the Company's operations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking information. Factors that could adversely affect future results include, but are not limited to, downturns in national and/or local economies; a softening of the domestic advertising market; world, national, or local events that could disrupt broadcast television; increased consolidation among major advertisers or other events depressing the level of advertising spending; the unexpected loss or insolvency of one or more major clients; the integration of acquired businesses; changes in consumer reading, purchasing and/or television viewing patterns; increases in paper, postage, printing, syndicated programming or other costs; changes in television network affiliation agreements; technological developments affecting products or methods of distribution; changes in government regulations affecting the Company's industries; increases in interest rates; and the consequences of acquisitions and/or dispositions. Meredith's Form 10 K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , includes a more complete description of the risk factors that may affect our results. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Meredith is exposed to certain market risks as a result of our use of financial instruments, in particular the potential market value loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and does not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose the Company to significant market risk. Readers are referred to Item 7A,   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,   in the Company's Form 10 K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , for a more complete discussion of these risks. 
    
  Interest Rates 
  We generally manage our risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of a combination of variable and fixed-rate debt. At   September 30, 2016  , Meredith had   $100.0 million   outstanding in fixed-rate long-term debt. In addition, Meredith has effectively converted the   $250.0 million   floating-rate senior notes and   $50.0 million   of the term loan to fixed-rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps. Since the interest rate swaps hedge the variability of interest payments on variable-rate debt with the same terms, they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. There are no earnings or liquidity risks associated with the Company's fixed-rate debt. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt (based on discounted cash flows reflecting borrowing rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities) varies with fluctuations in interest rates. A 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have changed the fair value of the fixed-rate debt to $100.8 million from $100.6 million at   September 30, 2016  . 

22 

At   September 30, 2016  ,   $598.8 million   of our debt was variable-rate debt before consideration of the impact of the swaps. The Company is subject to earnings and liquidity risks for changes in the interest rate on the portion of this debt that is not hedged by interest rate swaps. A 10 percent increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $0.6 million. 
    
  The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount, based on discounted cash flows, the Company would pay or receive to terminate the swap agreements. We intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting. However, if hedges were not to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges could have an impact on our consolidated net earnings. 
    
  Broadcast Rights Payable 
  There has been no material change in the market risk associated with broadcast rights payable since   June 30, 2016  . 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

Meredith's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that Meredith files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to Meredith's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There have been no significant changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
