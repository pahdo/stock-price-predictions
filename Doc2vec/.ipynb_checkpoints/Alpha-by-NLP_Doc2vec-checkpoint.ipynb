    "# NLP on SEC Forms Using Doc2vec with Gensim\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we reference <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053.pdf\">Le and Mikolov 2014</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words Model\n",
    "Traditional state-of-the-art document representations are based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model\">bag-of-words model</a>, which represent input documents as a fixed-length vector. For example, borrowing from the Wikipedia article, the two documents  \n",
    "(1) `John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.`  \n",
    "(2) `John also likes to watch football games.`  \n",
    "are used to construct a length 10 list of words  \n",
    "`[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\"]`  \n",
    "so then we can represent the two documents as fixed length vectors whose elements are the frequencies of the corresponding words in our list  \n",
    "(1) `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`  \n",
    "(2) `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`  \n",
    "Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective but lose information about word order. Bag of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram\">n-grams</a> models consider word phrases of length n to capture local word order but suffer from data sparsity and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2vec Model\n",
    "Word2vec uses a shallow neural network to embed words in a high-dimensional vector space. In the resulting vector space, close word vectors have similar contextual meanings and distant word vectors have different contextual meanings. For example, `strong` and `powerful` would be closer together than `strong` and `Paris`. Word2vec models can be trained using two prediction tasks which represent the skip-gram and continuous-bag-of-words models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2vec - Skip-gram Model\n",
    "The Skip-gram <a href=\"http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/\">Word2vec</a> Model takes in pairs (word1, word2) generated by moving a window across text data and trains a 1-hidden-layer neural network based on the fake task giving us a predicted probability distribution of nearby words to a given input word. The hidden-to-output weights in the neural network become the word embeddings. So if the hidden layer has 300 neurons, this network woulld give us 300-dimensional word embeddings. We use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot\">one-hot</a> encoding for the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2vec - Continuous-bag-of-words Model\n",
    "The Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec Model is also a 1-hidden-layer neural network. This time, the fake task is to predict the center word based on context words in a window around the center word. Again, the hidden-to-output weights become the word embeddings and we use one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paragraph Vector\n",
    "Le and Mikolov 2014 introduces the <i>Paragraph Vector</i>, which outperforms representing a documents by averaging or concatenating the word vectors of a document. We determine the embedding of the paragraph in its vector space in the same way as words - by training a shallow neural network on a fake task. Paragraph Vectors consider local word order but also give us a dense vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Memory (PV-DM)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector Model analogous to the Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec Model. Paragraph Vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the fake task of inferring a center word based on context words and a context paragraph. A paragraph is a context for all words in the paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector Model analogous to the Skip-gram Word2vec Model. Paragraph Vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the fake task of predicting a probability distribution of words in a paragraph given a randomly-sampled word from the paragraph.\n",
