    "# NLP on SEC Forms Using Doc2vec with Gensim\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we reference <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053.pdf\">Le and Mikolov 2014</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words Model\n",
    "Traditional state-of-the-art document representations are based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model\">bag-of-words model</a>, which represent input documents as a fixed-length vector. For example, borrowing from the Wikipedia article, the two documents  \n",
    "(1) `John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.`  \n",
    "(2) `John also likes to watch football games.`  \n",
    "are used to construct a length 10 list of words  \n",
    "`[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\"]`  \n",
    "so then we can represent the two documents as fixed length vectors whose elements are the frequencies of the corresponding words in our list  \n",
    "(1) `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`  \n",
    "(2) `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`  \n",
    "Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective but lose information about word order. Bag of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram\">n-grams</a> models consider word phrases of length n to capture local word order but suffer from data sparsity and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2vec Model\n",
    "Word2vec uses a shallow neural network to embed words in a high-dimensional vector space. In the resulting vector space, close word vectors have similar contextual meanings and distant word vectors have different contextual meanings. For example, `strong` and `powerful` would be closer together than `strong` and `Paris`. Word2vec models can be trained using two prediction tasks which represent the skip-gram and continuous-bag-of-words models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2vec - Skip-gram Model\n",
    "The Skip-gram <a href=\"http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/\">Word2vec</a> Model takes in pairs (word1, word2) generated by moving a window across text data and trains a 1-hidden-layer neural network based on the fake task giving us a predicted probability distribution of nearby words to a given input word. The hidden-to-output weights in the neural network become the word embeddings. So if the hidden layer has 300 neurons, this network woulld give us 300-dimensional word embeddings. We use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot\">one-hot</a> encoding for the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2vec - Continuous-bag-of-words Model\n",
    "The Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec Model is also a 1-hidden-layer neural network. This time, the fake task is to predict the center word based on context words in a window around the center word. Again, the hidden-to-output weights become the word embeddings and we use one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paragraph Vector\n",
    "Le and Mikolov 2014 introduces the <i>Paragraph Vector</i>, which outperforms representing a documents by averaging or concatenating the word vectors of a document. We determine the embedding of the paragraph in its vector space in the same way as words - by training a shallow neural network on a fake task. Paragraph Vectors consider local word order but also give us a dense vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Memory (PV-DM)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector Model analogous to the Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec Model. Paragraph Vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the fake task of inferring a center word based on context words and a context paragraph. A paragraph is a context for all words in the paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector Model analogous to the Skip-gram Word2vec Model. Paragraph Vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the fake task of predicting a probability distribution of words in a paragraph given a randomly-sampled word from the paragraph.\n",

the accounts of northeast bancorp ( northeast or the company ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary , northeast bank ( the bank ) . these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ( us gaap ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to form 10-q and article 10 of regulation s-x . accordingly , they do not include all of the information and notes required by gaap for complete financial statements . in the opinion of management , the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments ( consisting principally of normal recurring accruals ) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial position , results of operations , and cash flows for the interim periods presented . these financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2016 ( fiscal 2016 ) included in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the securities and exchange commission . 2 . recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued asu 2014-09 , revenue from contracts with customers ( topic 606 ) ( asu 2014-09 ) . asu 2014-09 implements a common revenue standard that clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue . the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services . to achieve that core principle , an entity should apply the following steps : ( i ) identify the contract ( s ) with a customer , ( ii ) identify the performance obligations in the contract , ( iii ) determine the transaction price , ( iv ) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and ( v ) recognize revenue when ( or as ) the entity satisfies a performance obligation . asu 2015-14 , revenue from contracts with customers ( topic 606 ) ( asu 2014-09 ) was issued in august 2015 which defers adoption to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 , 2017 . the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements . in january 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-01 , financial instruments overall ( subtopic 825-10 ) : recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities ( asu 2016-01 ) . this guidance changes how entities account for equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting . entities will be required to measure these investments at fair value at the end of each reporting period and recognize changes in fair value in net income . a practicability exception will be available for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values , however ; the exception requires the company to adjust the carrying amount for impairment and observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer . this guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current us gaap . this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2017 , including interim periods within the fiscal year . early adoption is permitted for only one of the six amendments . the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements . in february 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-02 , leases ( topic 842 ) ( asu 2016-02 ) . the new guidance establishes the principles to report transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases . entities will be required to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases in the statement of financial position and to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about lease transactions , such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases . this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2018 , including interim periods within the fiscal year . the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements . in march 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-05 , derivatives and hedging ( topic 815 ) : effect of derivative contract novations on existing hedge accounting relationships ( asu 2016-05 ) . the new guidance clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under topic 815 does not , in and of itself , require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met . this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2016 , and interim periods within those fiscal years . the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements . in march 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-09 , compensation-stock compensation ( topic 718 ) : improvements to employee share-based payment accounting ( asu 2016-09 ) . the new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions , including the income tax consequences , classification of awards as either equity or liabilities , and classification on the statement of cash flows . entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled . this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2016 , and interim periods within those annual periods . the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements . 8 table of contents in june 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-13 , financial instruments credit losses ( topic 326 ) ( asu 2016-13 ) . this update is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date . to achieve this objective , the amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current us gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates . this asu will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2019 . early adoption is available as of the fiscal year beginning after december 15 , 2018 . the company is currently evaluating the impact of this asu on its consolidated financial statements . in august 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-15 , statement of cash flows ( topic 230 ) ( asu 2016-15 ) . this update clarifies and provides guidance on several cash receipt and cash payment classification issues , including debt prepayment and extinguishment costs , settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments , contingent consideration payments made after a business combination , proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims , proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies , including bank-owned life insurance policies , distributions received from equity method investees , beneficial interests in securitization transactions , and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle . the amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2017 , and interim periods within those fiscal years . early adoption is permitted , including adoption in an interim period . the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements . 9 table of contents 3 . securities available-for-sale the following presents a summary of the amortized cost , gross unrealized holding gains and losses , and fair value of securities available for sale . when securities are sold , the adjusted cost of the specific security sold is used to compute the gain or loss on sale . there were no securities sold during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 or 2015 . at september 30 , 2016 , no investment securities were pledged as collateral to secure outstanding borrowings . the following summarizes the company s gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position . there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses on securities during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 or 2015 . at september 30 , 2016 , the company had seven securities in a continuous loss position for greater than twelve months . at september 30 , 2016 , all of the company s available-for-sale securities were issued or guaranteed by either government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises . the decline in fair value of the company s available-for-sale securities at september 30 , 2016 is attributable to changes in interest rates . in addition to considering current trends and economic conditions that may affect the quality of individual securities within the company s investment portfolio , management of the company also considers the company s ability and intent to hold such securities to maturity or recovery of cost . at september 30 , 2016 , the company does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of its amortized cost . as such , management does not believe any of the company s available-for-sale securities are other-than-temporarily impaired at september 30 , 2016 . the investment measured at net asset value is a fund that seeks to invest in securities either issued or guaranteed by the u . s . government or its agencies . the underlying composition of such fund is primarily government agencies or other investment-grade investments . the effective duration of the investments is 4 . 67 years at september 30 , 2016 . 10 table of contents the amortized cost and fair values of available-for-sale debt securities by contractual maturity are shown below as of september 30 , 2016 . actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties . 11 table of contents 4 . loans , allowance for loan losses and credit quality loans are carried at the principal amounts outstanding , or amortized acquired fair value in the case of acquired loans , adjusted by partial charge-offs and net of deferred loan costs or fees . loan fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized into interest income over the expected term of the loan using the level-yield method . when a loan is paid off , the unamortized portion is recognized in interest income . interest income is accrued based upon the daily principal amount outstanding except for loans on nonaccrual status . loans purchased by the company are accounted for under asc 310-30 , receivables loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality ( \" asc 310-30 \" ) . at acquisition , the effective interest rate is determined based on the discount rate that equates the present value of the company's estimate of cash flows with the purchase price of the loan . prepayments are not assumed in determining a purchased loan's effective interest rate and income accretion . the application of asc 310-30 limits the yield that may be accreted on the purchased loan , or the \" accretable yield , \" to the excess of the company's estimate , at acquisition , of the expected undiscounted principal , interest , and other cash flows over the company's initial investment in the loan . the excess of contractually required payments receivable over the cash flows expected to be collected on the loan represents the purchased loan's \" nonaccretable difference . \" subsequent improvements in expected cash flows of loans with nonaccretable differences result in a prospective increase to the loan's effective yield through a reclassification of some , or all , of the nonaccretable difference to accretable yield . the effect of subsequent credit-related declines in expected cash flows of purchased loans are recorded through a specific allocation in the allowance for loan losses . loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days as to either principal or interest , or when in management's judgment the collectability of interest or principal of the loan has been significantly impaired . loans accounted for under asc 310-30 are placed on nonaccrual when it is not possible to reach a reasonable expectation of the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected on the loan . when a loan has been placed on nonaccrual status , previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest on loans . interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on a cash-basis or using the cost-recovery method when collectability is doubtful . a loan is returned to accrual status when collectability of principal is reasonably assured and the loan has performed for a reasonable period of time . in cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and the company makes certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms , the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring ( \" tdr \" ) , and therefore by definition is an impaired loan . concessionary modifications may include adjustments to interest rates , extensions of maturity , and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral . for loans accounted for under asc 310-30 , the company evaluates whether it has granted a concession by comparing the restructured debt terms to the expected cash flows at acquisition plus any additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition . as a result , if an asc 310-30 loan is modified to be consistent with , or better than , the company's expectations at acquisition , the modified loan would not qualify as a tdr . nonaccrual loans that are restructured generally remain on nonaccrual status for a minimum period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms . if the restructured loan is on accrual status prior to being modified , it is reviewed to determine if the modified loan should remain on accrual status . if the borrower's ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured , the loan is classified as a nonaccrual loan . with limited exceptions , loans classified as tdrs remain classified as such until the loan is paid off . the composition of the company s loan portfolio is as follows on the dates indicated . total loans include deferred loan origination costs of $367 thousand and fees of $58 thousand as of september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . 12 table of contents past due and nonaccrual loans the following is a summary of past due and non-accrual loans : allowance for loan losses and impaired loans the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings . for residential and consumer loans , a charge-off is recorded no later than the point at which a loan is 180 days past due if the loan balance exceeds the fair value of the collateral , less costs to sell . for commercial loans , a charge-off is recorded on a case-by-case basis when all or a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible . subsequent recoveries , if any , are credited to the allowance . the allowance for loan losses consists of general , specific , and unallocated reserves and reflects management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date . management uses a consistent and systematic process and methodology to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis . the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is segregated by portfolio segments , which include : commercial real estate , commercial and industrial , consumer , residential real estate , and purchased loans . risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows : residential real estate : all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality , loan-to-value ratio and income of the individual borrower . the overall health of the economy , particularly unemployment rates and housing prices , has a significant effect on the credit quality in this segment . for purposes of the company s allowance for loan loss calculation , home equity loans and lines of credit are included in residential real estate . commercial real estate : loans in this segment are primarily income-producing properties . for owner-occupied properties , the cash flows are derived from an operating business , and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business . the underlying cash flows generated by non-owner occupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy rates . management periodically obtains rent rolls , with which it monitors the cash flows of these loans . adverse developments in either of these areas will have an adverse effect on the credit quality of this segment . for purposes of the allowance for loan losses , this segment also includes construction loans . 13 table of contents commercial and industrial : loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by the assets of the business . repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business . weakness in national or regional economic conditions , and a corresponding weakness in consumer or business spending , will have an adverse effect on the credit quality of this segment . consumer : loans in this segment are generally secured , and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower . repayment of consumer loans is generally based on the earnings of individual borrowers , which may be adversely impacted by regional labor market conditions . purchased : loans in this segment are typically secured by commercial real estate , multi-family residential real estate , or business assets and have been acquired by the bank's loan acquisition and servicing group ( lasg ) . loans acquired by the lasg are , with limited exceptions , performing loans at the date of purchase . repayment of loans in this segment is largely dependent on cash flow from the successful operation of the property , in the case of non-owner occupied property , or operating business , in the case of owner-occupied property . loan performance may be adversely affected by factors affecting the general economy or conditions specific to the real estate market , such as geographic location or property type . loans in this segment are evaluated for impairment under asc 310-30 . the company reviews expected cash flows from purchased loans on a quarterly basis . the effect of a decline in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition of the loan is recognized through a specific allocation in the allowance for loan losses the general component of the allowance for loan losses for originated loans is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by loan segment . the company does not weight periods used in that analysis to determine the average loss rate in each portfolio segment . this historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors : levels and trends in delinquencies ; trends in the volume and nature of loans ; trends in credit terms and policies , including underwriting standards , procedures and practices , and the experience and ability of lending management and staff ; trends in portfolio concentration ; national and local economic trends and conditions ; effects of changes or trends in internal risk ratings ; and other effects resulting from trends in the valuation of underlying collateral . the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are classified as impaired . impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent . an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan . for all portfolio segments , except loans accounted for under asc 310-30 , a loan is considered impaired when , based on current information and events , it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement . loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired . management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis , taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower , including the length of the delay , the reasons for the delay , the borrower s prior payment record , and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed . for the purchased loan segment , a loan is considered impaired when , based on current information and events , it is probable that the company will be unable to realize cash flows as expected at acquisition . for loans accounted for under asc 310-30 for which cash flows can reasonably be estimated , loan impairment is measured based on the decrease in expected cash flows from those estimated at acquisition , excluding changes due to changes in interest rate indices and other non-credit related factors , discounted at the loan s effective rate assumed at acquisition . factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status , collateral value , and the probability of collecting the scheduled principal and interest payments when due . 14 table of contents the following table sets forth activity in the company s allowance for loan losses . the following table sets forth information regarding the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment and impairment methodology . 15 table of contents the following table sets forth information regarding impaired loans . loans accounted for under asc 310-30 that have performed based on cash flow and accretable yield expectations determined at date of acquisition are not considered impaired assets and have been excluded from the tables below . the following tables set forth information regarding interest income recognized on impaired loans . 16 table of contents credit quality the company utilizes a ten-point internal loan rating system for commercial real estate , construction , commercial and industrial , and certain residential loans as follows : loans rated 1 6 : loans in these categories are considered pass rated loans . loans in categories 1-5 are considered to have low to average risk . loans rated 6 are considered marginally acceptable business credits and have more than average risk . loans rated 7 : loans in this category are considered special mention . these loans show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management . loans rated 8 : loans in this category are considered substandard . loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged , if any . assets so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt . loans rated 9 : loans in this category are considered doubtful . loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in one graded 8 with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full , on the basis of currently existing facts , conditions and values , highly questionable and improbable . loans rated 10 : loans in this category are considered loss and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted . on an annual basis , or more often if needed , the company formally reviews the ratings of all loans subject to risk ratings . semi-annually , the company engages an independent third-party to review a significant portion of loans within these segments . management uses the results of these reviews as part of its annual review process . risk ratings on purchased loans , with and without evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition , are determined relative to the company s recorded investment in that loan , which may be significantly lower than the loan s unpaid principal balance . the following tables present the company s loans by risk rating . ( 1 ) certain of the company s loans made for commercial purposes , but secured by residential collateral , are rated under the company s risk-rating system . 17 table of contents troubled debt

following tables present a summary of loans accounted for under asc 310-30 that were acquired by the company during the period indicated . certain of the loans accounted for under asc 310-30 that were acquired by the company are not accounted for using the income recognition model because the company cannot reasonably estimate cash flows expected to be collected . these loans when acquired are placed on non-accrual . the carrying amounts of such loans are as follows . the following tables summarize the activity in the accretable yield for loans accounted for under asc 310-30 . the following table provides information related to the unpaid principal balance and carrying amounts of asc 310-30 loans . 19 table of contents 5 . transfers and servicing of financial assets the company sells loans in the secondary market and for certain loans , retains the servicing responsibility . consideration for the sale includes the cash received as well as the related servicing rights asset . the company receives fees for the services provided . capitalized servicing rights as of september 30 , 2016 totaled $2 . 2 million , compared to $1 . 8 million as of june 30 , 2016 , included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets . mortgage loans sold in the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 totaled $25 . 0 million , compared to $28 . 9 million in the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $12 . 5 million at september 30 , 2016 and $12 . 9 million at june 30 , 2016 . additionally , the company was servicing commercial loans participated out to various other institutions amounting to $33 . 2 million and $35 . 9 million at september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . sba loans sold during the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 totaled $7 . 4 million , compared to $5 . 5 million in the quarter september 30 , 2015 . sba loans serviced for others totaled $103 . 6 million at september 30 , 2016 and $80 . 8 million at june 30 , 2016 . mortgage and sba loans serviced for others are accounted for as sales and therefore are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets . the risks inherent in mortgage servicing assets and sba servicing assets relate primarily to changes in prepayments that result from shifts in interest rates . contractually specified servicing fees were $160 thousand and $149 thousand for the quarters ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , and were included as a component of loan related fees within non-interest income . the significant assumptions used in the valuation for mortgage servicing rights as of september 30 , 2016 included a weighted average discount rate of 5 . 5% and a weighted average prepayment speed assumption of 18 . 7% . for the sba servicing rights , the significant assumptions used in the valuation included a range of discount rates from 8 . 5% to 14 . 1% and a weighted average prepayment speed assumption of 7 . 7% 6 . earnings per share ( eps ) eps is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding ( including participating securities ) . the company s only participating securities are unvested restricted stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends . the following table shows the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the periods indicated . shares issuable relative to stock options granted have been reflected as an increase in the shares outstanding used to calculate diluted eps , after applying the treasury stock method . the number of shares outstanding for basic and diluted eps is presented as follows : for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , the following stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted eps due to the exercise price of these options exceeding the average market price of the company s common stock for the period . these options , which were not dilutive at that date , may potentially dilute eps in the future . 20 table of contents 7 . derivatives and hedging activities the company has stand-alone derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate caps that derive their value from a fee paid and are adjusted to fair value based on index and strike rate , and swap agreements that derive their value from the underlying interest rate . these transactions involve both credit and market risk . the notional amounts are amounts on which calculations , payments and the value of the derivative are based . notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures . direct credit exposure arises in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these agreements , and is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid , if any . such differences , which represent the fair value of the derivative instruments , are reflected on the company's balance sheet as derivative assets and derivative liabilities . the company controls the credit risk of its financial contracts through credit approvals , limits and monitoring procedures , and does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations . the company currently holds derivative instruments that contain credit-risk related features that are in a net liability position , which may require that collateral be assigned to dealer banks . at september 30 , 2016 , the company had posted cash collateral totaling $3 . 1 million with dealer banks related to derivative instruments in a net liability position . the company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments . the company does not net the amount recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral against the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement . risk management policies derivative instruments the company evaluates the effectiveness of entering into any derivative instrument agreement by measuring the cost of such an agreement in relation to the reduction in net income volatility within an assumed range of interest rates . interest rate risk management cash flow hedging instruments the company uses variable rate debt as a source of funds for use in the company's lending and investment activities and other general business purposes . these debt obligations expose the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates . if interest rates increase , interest expense increases . conversely , if interest rates decrease , interest expense decreases . management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments and , therefore , generally hedges a portion of its variable-rate interest payments . information pertaining to outstanding interest rate caps and swap agreements used to hedge variable rate debt is as follows . during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , no interest rate cap or swap agreements were terminated prior to maturity . changes in the fair value of interest rate caps and swaps designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate debt are reported in other comprehensive income . these amounts subsequently are reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the debt affects earnings . risk management results for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 related to the balance sheet hedging of variable rate debt indicates that the hedges were effective . 21 table of contents 8 . other comprehensive income the components of other comprehensive income ( loss ) are as follows : accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised of the following : 22 table of contents 9 . commitments and contingencies commitments the company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates . these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit , standby letters of credit , and commitments to fund investments . those instruments involve , to varying degrees , elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets . the contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the company has in particular classes of financial instruments . the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments . the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments . financial instruments with contract amounts which represent credit risk are as follows : commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract . commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee . since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon , the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements . the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis . the amount of collateral obtained , if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit , is based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party . collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable , inventory , property , plant and equipment , and income-producing commercial properties . the company has recorded an allowance for possible losses on commitments and unfunded loans totaling $56 thousand and $81 thousand recorded in other liabilities at september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . the company committed $2 . 5 million to a fund that acquires cra qualified investments in loans for the company s portfolio . the fund manager will call the funds from the company when an investment is successfully acquired . through the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , the fund has not called any funds from the company . contingencies the company and its subsidiary are parties to litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business . management believes that the liabilities , if any , arising from such litigation and claims will not be material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations . 10 . stock-based compensation a summary of restricted share activity for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 follows : a summary of the vesting schedule for the shares granted in the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 follows : 50 , 000 restricted shares are subject to performance-based vesting over a three year period ( the performance shares ) . the performance shares include an absolute metric and a sliding metric within the performance period . the absolute metric requires that the company be in compliance with the regulatory commitments made to the federal reserve bank and maine bureau of financial institutions . the sliding metric is based on reaching certain thresholds in regards to the company s return on equity ( roe ) . the performance shares shall vest in certain defined increments for such periods if the roe is at least 70% of such targeted returns . this performance will be measured on both a year-by-year basis for three years , and an average basis over the three year performance period ; and , 23 table of contents 11 . fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction ( that is , not a forced liquidation or distressed sale ) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions . the company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date , including during periods of market dislocation . in periods of market dislocation , the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments . this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from one level to another . when market assumptions are not readily available , the company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date . if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability , regardless of the valuation technique ( s ) used , the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same . asc 820 defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value . the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ( level 1 measurements ) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs ( level 3 measurements ) . the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under asc 820 are described below : level 1 inputs are quoted prices ( unadjusted ) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date . level 2 valuations based on significant observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities ; quoted prices in markets that are not active ; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data . level 3 prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable . to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market , the determination of fair value requires more judgment . accordingly , the degree of judgment exercised by the company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 . a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement . valuation technique s - there have been no changes in the valuation techniques used during the current period . transfers - there were no transfers of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the current period . assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis : available-for-sale securities - where quoted prices are available in an active market , securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy . examples of such instruments include publicly-traded common and preferred stocks . if quoted prices are not available , then fair values are estimated by using pricing models ( i . e . , matrix pricing ) and market interest rates and credit assumptions or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy . examples of such instruments include government agency and government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities , as well as certain preferred and trust preferred stocks . level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized . certain investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient . the fund seeks to invest in securities either issued or guaranteed by the u . s . government or its agencies . the company s investments can be redeemed daily at the closing net asset value per share . in accordance with asu 2015-07 , these investments have not been included in the fair value hierarchy . derivative financial instruments - the valuation of the company s interest rate swaps and caps are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of derivatives . these analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives , including the period to maturity , and use observable market-based inputs , including forward interest rate curves and implied volatilities . unobservable inputs , such as credit valuation adjustments are insignificant to the overall valuation of the company s derivative financial instruments . accordingly , the company has determined that its interest rate derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy . the fair value of derivative loan commitments and forward loan sale agreements are estimated using the anticipated market price based on pricing indications provided from syndicate banks . these commitments and agreements are categorized as level 2 . the fair value of such instruments was nominal at each date presented . 24 table of contents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis : collateral dependent impaired loans - valuations of impaired loans measured at fair value are determined by a review of collateral values . certain inputs used in appraisals are not always observable , and therefore impaired loans are generally categorized as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy . real estate owned and other repossessed collateral - the fair values of real estate owned and other repossessed collateral are estimated based upon appraised values less estimated costs to sell . certain inputs used in appraisals are not always observable , and therefore may be categorized as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy . when inputs used in appraisals are primarily observable , they are classified as level 2 . loan servicing rights the fair value of the sba and mortgage servicing rights is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income . adjustments are only recorded when the discounted cash flows derived from the valuation model are less than the carrying value of the asset . certain inputs are not observable , and therefore loan servicing rights are generally categorized as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy . fair value of other financial instruments : cash and cash equivalents - the fair value of cash , due from banks , interest bearing deposits and fhlbb overnight deposits approximates their relative book values , as these financial instruments have short maturities . fhl b b stock - the carrying value of fhlbb stock approximates fair value based on redemption provisions of the fhlbb . loans - fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics . the fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan . the estimates of maturity are based on the company s historical experience with repayments for each loan classification , modified , as required , by an estimate of the effect of current economic conditions , lending conditions and the effects of estimated prepayments . loans held for sale - the fair value of loans held-for-sale is estimated based on bid quotations received from loan dealers . accrued interest receivable - the fair value of this financial instrument approximates the book value . it is the company s policy to stop accruing interest on loans past due by more than 90 days . therefore , this financial instrument has been adjusted for estimated credit loss . deposits - the fair value of deposits with no stated maturity , such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits , savings , now accounts and money market accounts , is equal to the amount payable on demand . the fair values of time deposits are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows . the discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities . the fair value estimates do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market . if that value were considered , the fair value of the company s net assets could increase . borrowings - the fair value of the company s borrowings with the fhlbb is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next re-pricing date based on current rates available to the company for borrowings with similar maturities . the fair value of the company s short-term borrowings , capital lease obligations , wholesale repurchase agreements and other borrowings is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity based on current rates available to the company for borrowings with similar maturities . off-balance sheet credit-related instruments - fair values for off-balance-sheet , credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements , taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit standing . the fair value of such instruments was nominal at each date presented . 25 table of contents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below . ( 1 ) in accordance with asu 820-10 , certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share ( or its equivalent ) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy . the fair value amount presented in the table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value amount to the consolidated financial statements . assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized below . the table below presents quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at the dates indicated . ( 1 ) fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral . the company may also use another available source of collateral assessment to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the collateral . appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic factors and estimated liquidation expenses . the range of these possible adjustments was 6% to 71% . ( 2 ) fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model . the unobservable inputs include anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates . the range of prepayment assumptions used was 7 . 7% to 18 . 7% . for discount rates , the range was 5 . 5% to 14 . 1% . 26 table of contents the following table presents the estimated fair value of the company's financial instruments . ( 1 ) in accordance with asu 820-10 , certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share ( or its equivalent ) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy . the fair value amount presented in the table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value amount to the consolidated financial statements . 27 table of contents

shareholders ) , and the former members of fhb collectively acquired approximately 60% of the company s outstanding common stock . the company applied the acquisition method of accounting , as described in accounting standards codification ( asc ) 805 , business combinations ( asc 805 ) to the merger , which represents an acquisition by fhb of northeast , with northeast as the surviving company . 28 table of contents in connection with the transaction , as part of the regulatory approval process , the company and the bank made certain commitments to the federal reserve , the most significant of which are ( i ) to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 10% , ( ii ) to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 15% , ( iii ) to limit purchased loans to 40% of total loans , ( iv ) to fund 100% of the company s loans with core deposits ( defined as non-maturity deposits and non-brokered insured time deposits ) , and ( v ) to hold commercial real estate loans

real estate loans from the commitment to hold commercial real estate loans to within 300% of total risk-based capital . all other commitments made to the federal reserve in connection with the merger remain unchanged . the company and the bank are currently in compliance with all commitments to the federal reserve . the company s compliance ratios at september 30 , 2016 follow : ( 1 ) core deposits include all non-maturity deposits and maturity deposits less than $250 thousand ( 2 ) for purposes of calculating this ratio , commercial real estate includes all non-owner occupied

potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions . the reader is encouraged to review each of the policies included in form 10-k for the year ended june 30 , 2016 to gain a better understanding of how northeast s financial performance is measured and reported . there has been no material change in critical accounting policies during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . overview net income was $1 . 8 million , or $0 . 19 per diluted common share , for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 , compared to $1 . 9 million , or $0 . 20 per diluted common share , for the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . 29 table of contents net interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses increased by $534 thousand , or 5 . 8% , to $9 . 8 million for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 compared to the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase is primarily due to higher average balances in the total loan portfolio , offset by higher average deposit balances and the effect of the issuance of the subordinated debt . noninterest income increased by $103 thousand for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 , compared to the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 , principally due to an increase in gains realized on sale of sba loans . noninterest expense increased by $816 thousand for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 , compared to the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 , primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1 . 1 million , largely attributable to higher employee headcount , increased incentive compensation , and the benefit recognized upon the forfeiture of stock awards in the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . financial condition overview total assets decreased by $585 thousand , or 0 . 1% , to $985 . 6 million at september 30 , 2016 , compared to june 30 , 2016 . the principal components of the change in the balance sheet were as follows : the loan portfolio excluding loans held for sale has grown by $29 . 0 million , or 4 . 2% , compared to june 30 , 2016 , principally on the strength of $28 . 5 million of net growth in commercial loans purchased or originated by the lasg and net growth of $5 . 1 million in originations by the sba division . this net growth was offset by a $4 . 6 million decrease in the bank s community banking division loan portfolio . loans generated by the lasg totaled $55 . 9 million for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 . the growth in lasg loans consisted of $13 . 9 million of purchased loans , at an average price of 82 . 5% of unpaid principal balance , and $42 . 0 million of originated loans . sba loans closed during the quarter totaled $15 . 2 million , of which $13 . 3 million were fully funded in the quarter . in addition , the company sold $7 . 4 million of the guaranteed portion of sba loans in the secondary market , of which $6 . 3 million were originated in the current quarter and $1 . 1 million were originated in prior quarters . residential loan production sold in the secondary market totaled $25 . 0 million for the quarter . as noted above in the business overview section , the company made certain commitments to the board of governors of the federal reserve system in connection with the merger of fhb formation llc with and into the company in december 2010 . the company s loan purchase and commercial real estate loan availability under these conditions follow . basis for regulatory condition condition availability at september 30 , 2016 ( dollars in millions ) total loans purchased loans may not exceed 40% of total loans $ 90 . 6 regulatory capital non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may not exceed 300% of total capital $ 165 . 8 an overview of the bank s lasg portfolio follows : ( 1 ) purchased loan balances include loans held for sale of $789 thousand . ( 2 ) the total return on purchased loans represents scheduled accretion , accelerated accretion , gains on asset sales , and other noninterest income recorded during the period divided by the average invested balance , which includes loans held for sale , on an annualized basis . the total return does not include the effect of purchased loan charge-offs or recoveries in the quarter . the total return presented is a non-gaap measure . 30 table of contents assets cash , short-term investments and securities cash and short-term investments were $126 . 2 million as of september 30 , 2016 , a decrease of $24 . 9 million , or 16 . 5% , from $151 . 2 million at june 30 , 2016 . the decrease is primarily due to the increase in loans , offset by the increase in deposits in the period . available-for-sale securities totaled $94 . 6 million as of september 30 , 2016 , compared to $100 . 6 million as of june 30 , 2016 , representing a decrease of $6 . 0 million , or 6 . 0% due to the maturity of securities issued by government agencies as well as principal payments on mortgage backed securities . included in available-for-sale securities are securities issued by government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises , as well as an investment of approximately $5 . 2 million in a cra qualified fund that seeks to invest in securities either issued or guaranteed by the u . s . government or its agencies . at september 30 , 2016 , no securities were pledged for outstanding borrowings . loans the company s loan portfolio ( excluding loans held-for-sale ) by lending division follows : 31 table of contents classification of assets loans are classified as non-performing when 90 or more days past due , unless a loan is well-secured and in the process of collection . loans less than 90 days past due , for which collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful , also may be designated as non-performing . in both situations , accrual of interest ceases . the company typically maintains such loans as non-performing until the respective borrowers have demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance . in cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and the company makes certain concessionary modifications , the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring ( tdr ) . concessionary modifications may include adjustments to interest rates , extensions of maturity , or other actions intended to minimize economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral . nonaccrual loans that are restructured generally remain on nonaccrual status for a minimum period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms . if the restructured loan is on accrual status prior to being modified , it is reviewed to determine if the modified loan should remain on accrual status . if the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured , the loan is classified as a nonaccrual loan . with limited exceptions , loans classified as tdrs remain classified as such until the loan is paid off . other nonperforming assets include other real estate owned ( oreo ) and other personal property securing loans repossessed by the bank . the real estate and personal property collateral for commercial and consumer loans is written down to its estimated realizable value upon repossession . revenues and expenses are recognized in the period when received or incurred on oreo and in substance foreclosures . gains and losses on disposition are recognized in noninterest income . the following table details the company's nonperforming assets and other credit quality indicators as of september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 . management believes that , based on their carrying amounts , nonperforming assets are well secured based on the estimated fair value of underlying collateral . at september 30 , 2016 , nonperforming assets totaled $12 . 7 million , or 1 . 29% of total assets , as compared to $9 . 5 million , or 0 . 96% of total assets , at june 30 , 2016 . the increase is largely due to one loan added to oreo and the effect of loans acquired in the current quarter which were classified as non-performing upon purchase . 32 table of contents allowance for loan losses in connection with the application of the acquisition method of accounting for the merger on december 29 , 2010 , the allowance for loan losses was reduced to zero when the loan portfolio was marked to its then current fair value . since that date , the company has provided for an allowance for loan losses as new loans are originated or in the event that credit exposure in the pre-merger loan portfolio or other acquired loans exceeds the exposure estimated when initial fair values were determined . the company s allowance for loan losses was $2 . 5 million as of september 30 , 2016 , which represents an increase of $156 thousand from $2 . 4 million as of june 30 , 2016 . the increase during the period was principally due to loan growth in the quarter . the following table details ratios related to the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated . while management believes that it uses the best information available to make its determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses , there can be no assurance that the company will not have to increase its provision for loan losses in the future as a result of changing economic conditions , adverse markets for real estate or other factors . other assets the cash surrender value of the company s bank-owned life insurance ( boli ) assets increased $114 thousand , or 0 . 7% to $15 . 8 million at september 30 , 2016 , compared to $15 . 7 million at june 30 , 2016 . increases in cash surrender value are recognized in other income and are not subject to income taxes . borrowing on , or surrendering a policy , may subject the company to income tax expense on the increase in cash surrender value . for these reasons , management considers boli an illiquid asset . boli represented 11 . 5% of the company s total capital at september 30 , 2016 . intangible assets totaled $1 . 6 million and $1 . 7 million at september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . the $109 thousand decrease was the result of core deposit intangible asset amortization during the period . deposits , borrowed funds , subordinated debt , liquidity , capital , and stock repurchases deposits the company s principal source of funding is its core deposit accounts . at september 30 , 2016 , non-maturity accounts , and certificates of deposit with balances less than $250 thousand represented 99 . 9% of total deposits . total deposits increased $5 . 0 million to $805 . 4 million as of september 30 , 2016 from $800 . 4 million as of june 30 , 2016 . the increase , which funded growth in the company s loan portfolio , was centered mainly in money market accounts attracted through the bank s community banking division . the composition of total deposits at september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 is as follows : borrowed funds advances from the fhlbb were $30 . 0 million at september 30 , 2016 , as compared to $30 . 1 million at june 30 , 2016 . at september 30 , 2016 , the company had pledged certain residential real estate loans , commercial real estate loans , and fhlbb deposits free of liens or pledges to secure outstanding advances and provide additional borrowing capacity . at september 30 , 2016 , no securities were pledged for outstanding borrowings . 33 table of contents subordinated debt on june 29 , 2016 , the company entered into a subordinated note purchase agreement with certain institutional accredited investors pursuant to which the company sold and issued subordinated notes equal to $15 . 05 million in aggregate principal amount with an interest rate of 6 . 75% fixed-to-floating maturing in 2026 ( subordinated notes ) . the subordinated notes , net of issuance costs of $524 thousand , totaled $14 . 5 million at both september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . the company had junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts totaling $8 . 9 million and $8 . 8 million at september 30 , 2016 and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . liquidity the following table is a summary of unused borrowing capacity of the company at september 30 , 2016 , in addition to traditional retail deposit products ( dollars in thousands ) : brokered time deposits $ 246 , 392 subject to policy limitation of 25% of total assets federal home loan bank of boston 68 , 478 unused advance capacity subject to eligible and qualified collateral federal discount window borrower-in-custody 1 , 742 unused credit line subject to the pledge of loans other available lines 17 , 500 total unused borrowing capacity $ 334 , 112 retail deposits and other core deposit sources including deposit listing services are used by the bank to manage its overall liquidity position . while we currently do not seek wholesale funding such as fhlbb advances and brokered deposits , the ability to raise them remains an important part of our liquidity contingency planning . while we closely monitor and forecast our liquidity position , it is affected by asset growth , deposit withdrawals and meeting other contractual obligations and commitments . the accuracy of our forecast assumptions may increase or decrease our overall available liquidity . to utilize the fhlbb advance capacity , the purchase of additional capital stock in the federal home loan bank of boston may be required . at september 30 , 2016 , the company had $411 . 2 million of immediately accessible liquidity , defined as cash that the bank reasonably believes could be raised within seven days through collateralized borrowings , brokered deposits or security sales . this position represented 41 . 9% of total assets . the company also had $126 . 2 million of cash and cash equivalents at september 30 , 2016 . management believes that there are adequate funding sources to meet its liquidity needs for the foreseeable future . primary funding sources are the repayment of principal and interest on loans , the renewal of time deposits , the potential for growth in the deposit base , and the credit availability from the fhlb . management does not believe that the terms and conditions that will be present at the renewal of these funding sources will significantly impact the company s operations , due to its management of the maturities of its assets and liabilities . capital the unpaid principal balance and carrying amount of junior subordinated debentures totaled $16 . 5 million and $8 . 9 million , respectively , as of september 30 , 2016 . this debt represents qualifying tier 1 capital for the company , up to a maximum of 25% of total tier 1 capital . at september 30 , 2016 , the carrying amounts of the junior subordinated notes , net of the company s $496 thousand investment in the affiliated trusts , qualified as tier 1 capital . at september 30 , 2016 , shareholders equity was $111 . 6 million , a decrease of $5 . 0 million , or 4 . 3% from june 30 , 2016 . book value per outstanding common share was $12 . 63 at september 30 , 2016 and $12 . 51 at june 30 , 2016 . tier 1 capital to total average assets of the company was 12 . 25% as of september 30 , 2016 and 13 . 27% at june 30 , 2016 . under the capital rules , risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing tier 1 and total capital , respectively , by risk-weighted assets . assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several risk-weight categories , based primarily on relative risk . the rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4 . 5% , a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 6% , a total capital ratio of 8% and a leverage ratio of 4% . additionally , subject to a transition schedule , the capital rules require a bank holding company to establish a capital conservation buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for \" adequately capitalized \" institutions equal to 2 . 5% of total risk weighted assets , or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends , pay discretionary bonuses , and to engage in share repurchases . a bank holding company , such as the company , is considered \" well capitalized \" if the bank holding company ( i ) has a total capital ratio of at least 10% , ( ii ) has a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% , and ( iii ) is not subject to any written agreement order , capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure . in addition , the fdic has amended its prompt corrective action rules to reflect the revisions made by the revised capital rules described above . under the fdic's revised rules , which became effective january 1 , 2015 , an insured state nonmember bank is considered \" well capitalized \" if it ( i ) has a total capital ratio of 10 . 0% or greater ; ( ii ) a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 . 0% or greater ; ( iii ) a common tier 1 equity ratio of 6 . 5% or greater , ( iv ) a leverage capital ratio of 5 . 0% or greater ; and ( iv ) is not subject to any written agreement , order , capital directive , or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure . 34 table of contents the company and the banks are considered \" well capitalized \" under all regulatory definitions . the company's and the bank's regulatory capital ratios are set forth below . stock repurchases on august 22 , 2016 , the company purchased 645 , 238 shares at a price of $10 . 75 per share . on october 21 , 2016 , the board of directors voted to amend the existing stock repurchase program to authorize the company to purchase an additional 500 , 000 shares of its common stock , representing 5 . 7% of the company s outstanding common shares . under the existing program , implemented in april 2014 , the company has purchased 1 , 970 , 000 shares through october 25 , 2016 and no shares remained available for repurchase under the program on that date , prior to the 500 , 000 share increase in the repurchase plan . the amended stock repurchase program will expire on october 21 , 2018 . off-balance sheet financial instruments the company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers . these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit , unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit . these instruments involve , to varying degrees , elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheet . the contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the company s involvement in particular classes of financial instruments . see part i . item i . notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements note 9 : commitments and contingencies for further discussion . 35 table of contents results of operations general net income decreased by $116 thousand to $1 . 8 million for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 , compared to $1 . 9 million for the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . the following table details the total return on purchased loans , which includes transactional interest income of $1 . 3 million for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 . the yield on purchased loans for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 was 10 . 4% as compared to 12 . 1% in the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 , primarily due to lower transactional income in the quarter . the following table details the total return on purchased loans : ( 1 ) the total return on purchased loans represents scheduled accretion , accelerated accretion , gains on asset sales , gains on real estate owned and other noninterest income recorded during the period divided by the average invested balance , which includes loans held for sale , on an annualized basis . the total return does not include the effect of purchased loan charge-offs or recoveries in the quarter . the total return presented is a non-gaap measure . net interest income three months ended september 30 , 201 6 and 201 5 net interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses increased by $534 thousand for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 , compared to the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase is primarily due to higher average balances in the total loan portfolio , offset by higher average deposit balances and the effect of the issuance of the subordinated debt . ( 1 ) includes loans held for sale . the company s interest rate spread decreased by 41 basis points and net interest margin decreased by 39 basis points for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 compared to the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . the decrease was principally due to lower transactional interest income in the purchased portfolio , as well as the effect of the issuance of the subordinated debt in june 2016 . 36 table of contents the following sets forth the average balance sheets , interest income and interest expense , and average yields and costs for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . ( 1 ) interest income and yield are stated on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 34% tax rate . fully tax-equivalent adjustment , a non-gaap measure , totaled $18 thousand for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . ( 2 ) includes loans held for sale . ( 3 ) nonaccrual loans are included in the computation of average , but unpaid interest has not been included for purposes of determining interest income . ( 4 ) short term investments include fhlb overnight deposits and other interest-bearing deposits . ( 5 ) net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets . 37 table of contents the following table presents the extent to which changes in volume and interest rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated . information is provided in each category with respect to ( i ) changes attributable to changes in volume ( changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate ) , ( ii ) changes attributable to changes in rates ( changes in rates multiplied by prior period volume ) and ( iii ) change attributable to a combination of changes in rate and volume ( change in rates multiplied by the changes in volume ) . changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate . provision for loan losses quarterly , the company determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses that is appropriate to provide for losses inherent in the company s loan portfolios , with the provision for loan losses determined by the net change in the allowance for loan losses . for loans accounted for under asc 310-30 , a provision for loan loss is recorded when estimates of future cash flows are lower than had been previously expected . see part i . item i . notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements note 4 : loans , allowance for loan losses and credit quality for further discussion . the provision for loan losses for periods subsequent to the merger with fhb formation llc reflects the impact of adjusting loans to their then fair values , as well as the elimination of the allowance for loan losses in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting . subsequent to the merger , the provision for loan losses has been recorded based on estimates of inherent losses in newly originated loans and for incremental reserves required for pre-merger loans based on estimates of deteriorated credit quality post-merger . the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 was $193 thousand and $169 thousand , respectively . the increase in the company s loan loss provision resulted principally due to the increased volume of newly originated loans . noninterest income noninterest income increased by $103 thousand for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 , compared to the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 , principally due to an increase in gains realized on sale of sba loans of $68 thousand . noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by $816 thousand for the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 , compared to the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 , primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1 . 1 million , largely attributable to higher employee headcount , increased incentive compensation , and the benefit recognized upon the forfeiture of stock awards in the quarter ended september 30 , 2015 . income taxes the company s income tax expense was $1 . 0 million or an effective rate of 36 . 6% , for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , as compared to $1 . 1 million , or an effective rate of 37 . 1% , for the three months ended september 30 , 2015 , primarily due to state apportionment changes . 38 table of contents item 3 . quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates , and typically encompasses exposures such as sensitivity to changes in market interest rates , foreign currency exchange rates , and commodity prices . the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodity price movements . because net interest income is our primary source of revenue , interest rate risk is a significant market risk to which the company is exposed . interest-rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of future net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates . net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as by fluctuations in the level , mix and duration of the company's assets and liabilities . over and above the influence that interest rates have on net interest income , changes in rates also affect the volume of lending activity , the ability of borrowers to repay loans , the volume of loan prepayments , the flow and mix of deposits , and the market value of the company's assets and liabilities . asset/liability management the company's management has established an asset liability management committee ( \" alco \" ) , which is responsible for managing the company's interest rate risk in accordance with policies and limits approved by the board of directors . with regard to management of market risk , the alco is charged with managing the company's mix of assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with the company's liquidity , capital adequacy , growth , and profitability goals . exposure to interest rate risk is managed by northeast through periodic evaluations of the current interest rate risk inherent in its rate-sensitive assets and liabilities , coupled with determinations of the level of risk considered appropriate given the company's capital and liquidity requirements , business strategy , and performance objectives . through such management , northeast seeks to mitigate the potential volatility in its net interest income due to changes in interest rates in a manner consistent with the risk appetite established by the board of directors . the alco's primary tool for measuring , evaluating , and managing interest rate risk is income simulation analysis . income simulation analysis measures the interest rate risk inherent in the company's balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over defined time horizons . these simulations take into account the specific repricing , maturity , prepayment and call options of financial instruments that vary under different interest rate scenarios . the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the exposure to a decline in net interest income remains within established tolerance levels over the simulation horizons and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure . the company considers a variety of specified rate scenarios , including instantaneous rate shocks , against static ( or flat ) rates when measuring interest rate risk , and evaluates results over two consecutive twelve-month periods . all changes are measured in comparison to the projected net interest income that would result from an \" unchanged \" scenario , where interest rates remain stable over the measured time horizon ( s ) . while the alco reviews simulation assumptions to ensure they are reasonable , and back-tests simulation results on a periodic basis as a monitoring tool , income simulation analysis may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of the company's interest rate risk or future earnings . there are inherent shortcomings in income simulation , given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made to perform it . for example , the projected level of future market interest rates and the shape of future interest rate yield curves have a major impact on income simulation results . many assumptions concerning the repricing of financial instruments , the degree to which non-maturity deposits react to changes in market rates , and the expected prepayment rates on loans , mortgage-backed securities , and callable debt securities are also inherently uncertain . in addition , as income simulation analysis assumes that the company's balance sheet will remain static over the simulation horizon , the results do not reflect the company's expectations for future balance sheet growth , nor changes in business strategy that the company could implement in response to rate shifts to mitigate its loss exposures . as such , although the analysis described above provides an indication of the company's sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time , these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company's net interest income and will differ from actual results . measuring interest-rate risk the company can be subject to margin compression depending on the economic environment and the shape of the yield curve . under the company's current balance sheet position , the company's margin generally performs slightly better over time in a rising rate environment , while it generally decreases in a declining rate environment and when the yield curve is flattening or inverted . under a flattening yield curve scenario , margin compression occurs as the spread between the cost of funding and the yield on interest earning assets narrows . under this scenario the degree of margin compression is highly dependent on the company's ability to fund asset growth through lower cost deposits . however , if the curve is flattening , while short-term rates are rising , the adverse impact on margin may be somewhat delayed , as increases in the prime rate will initially result in the company's asset yields re-pricing more quickly than funding costs . 39 table of contents under an inverted yield curve situation , shorter-term rates exceed longer-term rates , and the impact on margin is similar but more adverse than the flat curve scenario . again , however , the extent of the impact on margin is highly dependent on the company's balance sheet mix . in a declining rate environment , margin compression will eventually occur as the yield on interest earning assets decreases more rapidly than decreases in funding costs . the primary causes would be the impact of interest rate decreases ( including decreases in the prime rate ) on adjustable rate loans and the fact that decreases in deposit rates may be limited or lag decreases in the prime rate . there have been no material changes in the results of the company's net interest income sensitivity analysis as reported in the company's 2016 annual report on form 10-k . at september 30 , 2016 , management continues to consider the company's primary interest rate risk exposure to be margin compression that may result from changes in interest rates and/or changes in the mix of the company's balance sheet components . this would include the mix of fixed versus variable rate loans and investments on the asset side , and higher cost versus lower cost deposits and overnight borrowings versus term borrowings and certificates of deposit on the liability side . item 4 . controls and procedures the company maintains controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the company files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 ( exchange act ) is recorded , processed , summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission , and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company s management , including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer ( the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer , respectively ) , as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding timely disclosure . in designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures , management recognizes that any controls and procedures , no matter how well designed and operated , can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives , and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost/benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures . the company s management , with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer , has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures ( as defined in rules 13a-15 ( e ) and 15d-15 ( e ) under the exchange act ) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form 10-q . based on this evaluation of the company s disclosure controls and procedures , the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 , 2016 . there were no changes in the company s internal controls over financial reporting ( as defined in rule 13a-15 ( f ) of the exchange act ) that occurred during the quarter ended september 30 , 2016 that have materially affected , or is reasonably likely to materially affect , the company s internal controls over financial reporting . part ii other information item 1 . legal proceedings none . item 1a . risk factors there have been

first internet bancorp notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited ( table amounts in thousands except share and per share data ) note 1 : basis of presentation the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u . s . generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec . accordingly , they do not include all of the information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition , results of operations , or cash flows in accordance with gaap . in our opinion , all adjustments ( consisting only of normal recurring adjustments ) necessary for a fair presentation have been included . the results of operations for the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year ending december 31 , 2016 or any other period . the september 30 , 2016 condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the first internet bancorp annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31 , 2015 . the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates , judgments , or assumptions that could have a material effect on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities . these estimates , judgments , and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the disclosures provided . the determination of the allowance for loan losses , valuations and impairments of investment securities , and the accounting for income tax expense are highly dependent upon management s estimates , judgments , and assumptions where changes in any of these could have a significant impact on the financial statements . the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of first internet bancorp ( the company ) , its wholly-owned subsidiary , first internet bank of indiana ( the bank ) , and the bank s wholly-owned subsidiary , jkh realty services , llc . all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation . the company is subject to claims and lawsuits that arise primarily in the ordinary course of business . it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate resolution of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position , results of operations , and cash flows of the company . certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statements to conform to the presentation of the 2016 financial statements . these reclassifications had no effect on net income . 6 note 2 : earnings per share earnings per share of common stock are based on the weighted-average number of basic shares and dilutive shares outstanding during the period . the following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average common shares for the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . note 3 : securities the following tables summarize securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . there were no securities held-to-maturity as of december 31 , 2015 . 7 the carrying value of securities at september 30 , 2016 is shown below by their contractual maturity date . actual maturities will differ because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties . there were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . gross gains of $0 . 2 million and gross losses of $0 . 0 million resulted from sales of available-for-sale securities during the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 . there were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . certain investments in debt securities are reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost . the total fair value of these investments at september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 was $166 . 9 million and $ 166 . 1 million , which was approximately 35% and 78% , respectively , of the company s available-for-sale securities portfolio . these declines resulted primarily from fluctuations in market interest rates after purchase . u . s . government-sponsored agencies , municipal securities and corporate securities the unrealized losses on the company s investments in securities issued by u . s . government-sponsored agencies , municipal organizations and corporate entities were caused by interest rate changes . the contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the investments . because the company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not likely that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases , which may be maturity , the company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at september 30 , 2016 . 8 mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities the unrealized losses on the company s investments in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities were caused by interest rate changes . the company expects to recover the amortized cost bases over the term of the securities . because the company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not likely that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases , which may be maturity , the company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at september 30 , 2016 . should any future impairment of these securities become other-than-temporary , the cost basis of the security will be reduced , with the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period in which the other-than-temporary impairment ( otti ) is identified . the following tables show the available-for-sale securities portfolio s gross unrealized losses and fair value , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . there were no held-to-maturity securities in an unrealized loss position at september 30 , 2016 , and there were no held-to-maturity securities at december 31 , 2015 . 9 there were no amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) during the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) and the affected line items in the consolidated statements of income during the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2016 were as follows : details about accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) components amounts reclassified from

provision total reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) $ $ 117 net income note 4 : loans loans that management intends to hold until maturity are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for unearned income , charge-offs , the allowance for loan losses , any unamortized deferred fees or costs on originated loans , and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans . for loans recorded at cost , interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance . loan origination fees , net of certain direct origination costs , as well as premiums and discounts , are deferred and amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the loan . categories of loans include : 10 the risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows : commercial and industrial : commercial and industrial loans sources of repayment are primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower . the cash flows of borrowers , however , may not be as expected , and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value . loans are made for working capital , equipment purchases , or other purposes . most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate a personal guarantee . owner-occupied commercial real estate : the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower , or an affiliate of the borrower , who owns the property . this portfolio segment is generally concentrated in the central indiana and greater phoenix , arizona markets and its loans often times are secured by manufacturing and service facilities , as well as office buildings . investor commercial real estate : these loans are underwritten primarily based on the cash flow expected to be generated from the property and are secondarily supported by the value of the real estate . these loans typically incorporate a personal guarantee . this portfolio segment typically involves higher loan principal amounts , and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan . investor commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets , changing industry dynamics , or the overall health of the general economy . the properties securing the company s investor commercial real estate portfolio tend to be diverse in terms of property type and are typically located in the state of indiana and markets adjacent to indiana . management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on property financial performance , collateral value , guarantor strength , and other risk grade criteria . as a general rule , the company avoids financing special use projects or properties outside of its designated market areas unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk . construction : construction loans are secured by real estate and improvements and are made to assist in the construction of new structures , which may include commercial ( retail , industrial , office , multi-family ) properties or single family residential properties offered for sale by the builder . these loans generally finance a variety of project costs , including land , site preparation , construction , closing and soft costs and interim financing needs . the cash flows of builders , while initially predictable , may fluctuate with market conditions , and the value of the collateral securing these loans may be subject to fluctuations based on general economic changes . single tenant lease financing : these loans are made to property owners of real estate subject to long term lease arrangements with single tenant operators . the real estate is typically operated by regionally , nationally or globally branded businesses . the loans are underwritten based on the financial strength of the borrower , characteristics of the real estate , cash flows generated from the lease arrangements and the financial strength of the tenant . similar to the other loan portfolio segments , management monitors and evaluates these loans based on borrower and tenant financial performance , collateral value , industry trends and other risk grade criteria . residential mortgage : with respect to residential loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner occupied , the company typically establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded . repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the financial circumstances of the borrowers , which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels . repayment can also be impacted by changes in residential property values . risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers in geographically diverse locations throughout the country . home equity : home equity loans and lines of credit are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4 family residences . the properties securing the company's home equity portfolio segment are generally geographically diverse as the company offers these products on a nationwide basis . repayment of home equity loans and lines of credit may be impacted by changes in property values on residential properties and unemployment levels , among other economic conditions and financial circumstances in the market . other consumer : these loans primarily consist of consumer loans and credit cards . consumer loans may be secured by consumer assets such as horse trailers or recreational vehicles . some consumer loans are unsecured , such as small installment loans , home improvement loans and certain lines of credit . repayment of consumer loans is primarily dependent upon the personal income of the borrowers , which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels . risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers in geographically diverse locations throughout the country . 11 allowance for loan losses methodology company policy is designed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses ( alll ) . the portfolio is segmented by loan type , and the required alll for types of performing homogeneous loans which do not have a specific reserve is determined by applying a factor based on average historical losses , adjusted for current economic factors and portfolio trends . management believes the historical loss experience methodology is appropriate in the current economic environment as it captures loss rates that are comparable to the current period being analyzed . management adds qualitative factors for observable trends , changes in internal practices , changes in delinquencies and impairments , and external factors . observable factors include changes in the composition and size of portfolios , as well as loan terms or concentration levels . the company evaluates the impact of internal changes such as management and staff experience levels or modification to loan underwriting processes . delinquency trends are scrutinized for both volume and severity of past due , nonaccrual , or classified loans as well as any changes in the value of underlying collateral . finally , the company considers the effect of other external factors such as national , regional , and local economic and business conditions , as well as competitive , legal , and regulatory requirements . loans that are considered to be impaired are evaluated to determine the need for a specific allowance by applying at least one of three methodologies : present value of future cash flows ; fair value of collateral less costs to sell ; or the loan s observable market price . all troubled debt restructurings ( tdr ) are considered impaired loans . loans evaluated for impairment are removed from other pools to prevent double-counting . accounting standards codification ( asc ) topic 310 , receivables , requires that impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rates or the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell and allows existing methods for recognizing interest income . provision for loan losses a provision for estimated losses on loans is charged to income based upon management s evaluation of the potential losses . such an evaluation , which includes a review of all loans for which full repayment may not be reasonably assured , considers , among other matters , the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral , as applicable , economic conditions , loan loss experience , and other factors that are particularly susceptible to changes that could result in a material adjustment in the near term . while management attempts to use the best information available in making its evaluations , future allowance adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations . policy for charging off loans the company s policy is to charge off a loan at any point in time when it no longer can be considered a bankable asset , meaning collectible within the parameters of policy . a secured loan is generally charged down to the estimated fair value of the collateral , less costs to sell , no later than when it is 120 days past due as to principal or interest . an unsecured loan generally is charged off no later than when it is 180 days past due as to principal or interest . a home improvement loan generally is charged off no later than when it is 90 days past due as to principal or interest . the following tables present changes in the balance of the alll during the three and nine month periods ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . 12 13 the following tables present the recorded investment in loans based on portfolio segment and impairment method as of september 30 , 2016 , and december 31 , 2015 . 14 the company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its commercial loans . in the third quarter 2016 , the company updated its risk grading matrix to improve precision within the pass risk grades . commercial loans are now graded on a scale of 1 to 10 , whereas commercial loans were previously graded on a scale of 1 to 9 . this update to the risk grading matrix did not have an impact on the alll . the following table illustrates the risk ratings utilized as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . a description of the general characteristics of the ten risk grades is as follows : pass ( grades 1-6 ) - higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below . special mention ( grade 7 ) - loans that possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness which deserve close attention . substandard ( grade 8 ) - loans that possess a defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt . loans characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected . loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged , if any . doubtful ( grade 9 ) - such loans have been placed on nonaccrual status and may be heavily dependent upon collateral possessing a value that is difficult to determine or based upon some near-term event which lacks clear certainty . these loans have all of the weaknesses of those classified as substandard ; however , based on existing conditions , these weaknesses make full collection of the principal balance highly improbable . loss ( grade 10 ) - loans that are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuing to carry them as assets is not warranted . nonaccrual loans any loan which becomes 90 days delinquent or for which the full collection of principal and interest may be in doubt will be considered for nonaccrual status . at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status , all accrued but unpaid interest will be reversed from interest income . placing the loan on nonaccrual status does not relieve the borrower of the obligation to repay interest . a loan placed on nonaccrual status may be restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest has been brought current , and the company expects full payment of the remaining contractual principal and interest . the following tables present the credit risk profile of the company s commercial and consumer loan portfolios based on rating category and payment activity as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . 15 the following tables present the company s loan portfolio delinquency analysis as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . 16 impaired loans a loan is designated as impaired , in accordance with the impairment accounting guidance , when , based on current information or events , it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due ( principal and interest ) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement . payments with delays generally not exceeding 90 days outstanding are not considered impaired . certain nonaccrual and substantially all delinquent loans more than 90 days past due may be considered to be impaired . generally , loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due and accrued interest is reversed against earnings , unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection . the accrual of interest on impaired and nonaccrual loans is discontinued when , in management s opinion , the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due . impaired loans include nonperforming loans as well as loans modified in tdrs where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties . these concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan , payment extensions , forgiveness of principal , forbearance , or other actions intended to maximize collection . asc topic 310 , receivables , requires that impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rates or the fair value of the underlying collateral , less costs to sell , and allows existing methods for recognizing interest income . the following table presents the company s impaired loans as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . the company had no impaired loans with a specific valuation allowance as of september 30 , 2016 or december 31 , 2015 . 17 the table below presents average balances and interest income recognized for impaired loans during the three and nine month periods ended september 30 ,

received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . asc topic 820 also specifies a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value . the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value : level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 observable inputs other than level 1 prices , such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities ; quoted prices in markets that are not active ; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets , as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy . securities where quoted market prices are available in an active market , securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy . level 1 securities include highly liquid mutual funds . if quoted market prices are not available , then fair values are estimated by using pricing models , quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows . level 2 securities include u . s . government-sponsored agencies , municipal securities , mortgage and asset-backed securities and certain corporate securities . matrix pricing is a mathematical technique widely used in the banking industry to value investment securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for specific investment securities but also on the investment securities relationship to other benchmark quoted investment securities . in certain cases where level 1 or level 2 inputs are not available , securities are classified within level 3 of the hierarchy . fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows . discounted cash flows are calculated based off of the anticipated future cash flows updated to incorporate loss severities . rating agency and industry research reports as well as default and deferral activity are reviewed and incorporated into the calculation . the company did not own any securities classified within level 3 of the hierarchy as of september 30 , 2016 or december 31 , 2015 . loans held-for-sale ( mandatory pricing agreements ) the fair value of loans held-for-sale is determined using quoted prices for similar assets , adjusted for specific attributes of that loan ( level 2 ) . forward contracts the fair values of forward contracts on to-be-announced securities are determined using quoted prices in active markets , or benchmarked thereto ( level 1 ) . interest rate lock commitments the fair values of interest rate lock commitments ( irlcs ) are determined using the projected sale price of individual loans based on changes in market interest rates , projected pull-through rates ( the probability that an irlc will ultimately result in an originated loan ) , the reduction in the value of the applicant s option due to the passage of time , and the remaining origination costs to be incurred based on management s estimate of market costs ( level 3 ) . 21 the following tables present the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . 22 the following tables reconcile the beginning and ending balances of recurring fair value measurements recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets using significant unobservable ( level 3 ) inputs for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 , 2016 and september 30 , 2015 . the following describes valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis , as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy . impaired loans loans for which it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest due according to contractual terms are measured for impairment . the amount of the impairment may be determined based on the fair value of the underlying collateral , less costs to sell , the estimated present value of future cash flows or the loan s observable market price . if the impaired loan is identified as collateral dependent , the fair value of the underlying collateral , less costs to sell , is used to measure impairment . this method requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor to the value . if the impaired loan is not collateral dependent , the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to measure impairment . impaired loans with a specific valuation allowance based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis are classified as level 3 assets . there were no impaired loans that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at september 30 , 2016 or december 31 , 2015 . 23 significant unobservable ( level 3 ) inputs the following tables present quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in recurring and nonrecurring level 3 fair value measurements other than goodwill . the following methods were used to estimate the fair value of all other financial instruments recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at amounts other than fair value . cash and cash equivalents for these instruments , the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value . interest-bearing time deposits the fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying value . loans held-for-sale ( best efforts pricing agreements ) the fair value of these loans approximates carrying value . loans the fair value of loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and remaining maturities . accrued interest receivable the fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying value . federal home loan bank of indianapolis stock the fair value approximates carrying value . deposits the fair value of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits , savings and money market accounts approximates carrying value . the fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit and brokered deposits are estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities . advances from federal home loan bank the fair value of fixed rate advances is estimated using rates currently available for advances with similar remaining maturities . the carrying value of variable rate advances approximates fair value . subordinated debt the fair value of the company s publicly traded subordinated debt is obtained from quoted market prices . the fair value of the company s remaining subordinated debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis , based on current borrowing rates for similar types of debt instruments . 24 accrued interest payable the fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying value . commitments the fair value of commitments to extend credit are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar maturities and interest rates . the company determined that the fair value of commitments was zero based on the contractual value of outstanding commitments at each of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . the following tables summarize the carrying value and estimated fair value of all financial assets and liabilities at september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . 25 note 10 : mortgage banking activities the company s residential real estate lending business originates mortgage loans for customers and sells a majority of the originated loans into the secondary market . the company hedges its mortgage banking pipeline by entering into forward contracts for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors and entering into interest rate lock commitments with potential borrowers to fund specific mortgage loans that will be sold into the secondary market . to facilitate the hedging of the loans , the company has elected the fair value option for loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market under mandatory pricing agreements . changes in the fair value of loans held-for-sale , interest rate lock commitments and forward contracts are recorded in the mortgage banking activities line item within noninterest income . refer to note 11 for further information on derivative financial instruments . during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , the company originated mortgage loans held-for-sale of $180 . 1 million and $108 . 4 million , respectively , and sold $195 . 7 million and $112 . 9 million of mortgage loans , respectively , into the secondary market . during the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , the company originated mortgage loans held-for-sale of $439 . 2 million and $386 . 4 million , respectively , and sold $452 . 2 million and $400 . 0 million of mortgage loans , respectively , into the secondary market . the following table provides the components of income from mortgage banking activities for the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . note 11 : derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments to help manage exposure to interest rate risk and the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income and the fair value of assets and liabilities . the company enters into forward contracts for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors and enters into irlcs with potential borrowers to fund specific mortgage loans that will be sold into the secondary market . the forward contracts are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from the company s commitment to fund the loans . each of these items are considered derivatives , but are not designated as accounting hedges , and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in noninterest income on the condensed consolidated statements of income . the fair value of derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in accrued income and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets while derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets . the following table presents the notional amount and fair value of irlcs and forward contracts utilized by the company at september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 . 26 fair values of derivative financial instruments were estimated using changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the company entered into the irlc and the balance sheet date . the following table summarizes the periodic changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . note 12 : recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards update ( update ) 2016-15 , statement of cash flows ( topic 230 ) : classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments ( august 2016 ) stakeholders indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under topic 230 , statement of cash flows , and other topics . this update addresses specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice . the amendments in this update apply to all entities , including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under topic 230 . the amendments in this update provide guidance on the following specific cash flow issues : debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs : cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows from financing activities . settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing : at the settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing , the issuer should classify the portion of the cash payment attributable to the accreted interest related to the debt discount as cash outflows from operating activities , and the portion of the cash payment attributable to the principal as cash outflows for financing activities . proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims : cash proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the related insurance coverage ( that is , the nature of the loss ) . for insurance proceeds that are received in a lump sum settlement , an entity should determine the classification on the basis of the nature of each loss included in the settlement . proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies , including bank-owned life insurance policies : cash proceeds received from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities . the cash payments for premiums on corporate-owned policies may be classified as cash outflows from investing activities , operating activities , or a combination of investing and operating activities . 27 separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle : the classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows should be determined first by applying specific guidance in gaap . in the absence of specific guidance , an entity should determine each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and cash payments on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows . an entity should then classify each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and payments on the basis of their nature in financing , investing , or operating activities . in situations in which cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated by source or use , the appropriate classification should depend on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item . for public business entities , the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2017 , including interim periods within those fiscal years . early adoption is permitted , including adoption in an interim period . if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period , any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period . an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period . the amendments in this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented . if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues , the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable . the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update on the consolidated financial statements , but it is not expected to have a significant effect . 28 item 2 . management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and

$0 . 51 per diluted share , representing an increase in net income of $0 . 8 million , or 33 . 4% . during the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 , net income was $8 . 4 million , or $1 . 65 per diluted share , compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 net income of $6 . 7 million , or $1 . 46 per diluted share , representing an increase in net income of $1 . 7 million , or 25 . 8% . the increase in net income in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to a $2 . 5 million , or 31 . 9% , increase in net interest income and a $2 . 5 million , or 106 . 3% , increase in noninterest income , partially offset by a $2 . 2 million , or 35 . 5% , increase in noninterest expense , a $1 . 8 million , or 385 . 5% , increase in provision for loan losses and a $0 . 3 million , or 23 . 8% , increase in income tax expense . 30 the increase in net income in the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 was primarily due to a $6 . 6 million , or 29 . 7% , increase in net interest income and a $3 . 2 million , or 39 . 9% , increase in noninterest income , partially offset by a $4 . 5 million , or

balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the related yields and cost of funds . the tables do not reflect any effect of income taxes . balances are based on the average of daily balances . nonaccrual loans are included in average loan balances . 1 yield on total interest-earning assets minus cost of total interest-bearing liabilities 2 net interest income divided by total average interest-earning assets ( annualized ) 31 1 yield on total interest-earning assets minus cost of total interest-bearing liabilities 2 net interest income divided by total average interest-earning assets ( annualized ) 32 rate/volume analysis the following table illustrates the impact of changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and interest rates on net interest income for the periods indicated . the change in interest not due solely to volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each . net interest income for the third quarter 2016 was $10 . 3 million , an increase of $2 . 5 million , or 31 . 9% , compared to $7 . 8 million for the third quarter 2015 . the increase in net interest income was the result of a $4 . 9 million , or 46 . 8% , increase in total interest income to $15 . 5 million for the third quarter 2016 from $10 . 5 million for the third quarter 2015 . the increase in total interest income was partially offset by a $2 . 4 million , or 90 . 3% , increase in total interest expense to $5 . 1 million for the third quarter 2016 from $2 . 7 million for the third quarter 2015 . the increase in total interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest earned on loans resulting from an increase of $327 . 5 million , or 37 . 8% , in the average balance of loans , including loans held-for-sale , as well as an increase in interest earned on securities resulting from an increase of $265 . 8 million , or 138 . 7% , in the average balance of securities for the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015 . the increase in total interest income was also due to a 12 basis point ( bp ) increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio , partially offset by a 10 bp decline in the yield earned on loans , including loans held-for-sale . the increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $530 . 6 million , or 62 . 1% , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015 , as well as a 20 bp increase in the cost of funds related to interest-bearing deposits . the increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an 18 bp increase in the cost of certificates and brokered deposits as new certificates of deposits production in 2016 was predominately in longer duration products with higher costs of funds . interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense due to a $33 . 8 million , or 24 . 2% , increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015 as well as an increase of 51 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds . the increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds was primarily due to the company s issuance of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter 2015 as well as an increase in the cost and average balance of federal home loan bank advances compared to the third quarter 2015 . net interest margin ( nim ) was 2 . 42% for the third quarter 2016 compared to 2 . 84% for the third quarter 2015 . the decline in nim for the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015 was driven primarily by an increase of 23 bps in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as well as the decline of 20 bps in the yield earned on interest-earning assets . 33 net interest income for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 was $28 . 8 million , increasing $6 . 6 million , or 29 . 7% , compared to $22 . 2 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase in net interest income was the result of a $12 . 3 million , or 41 . 1% , increase in total interest income to $42 . 1 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 from $29 . 9 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase in total interest income was partially offset by a $5 . 7 million , or 74 . 1% , increase in total interest expense to $13 . 4 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 from $7 . 7 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase in total interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest earned on loans resulting from an increase of $284 . 0 million , or 34 . 5% , in the average balance of loans , including loans held-for-sale , as well as an increase in interest earned on securities resulting from an increase of $174 . 3 million , or 100 . 7% , in the average balance of securities for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase in total interest income was also due to a 21 bps increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio , partially offset by a 7 bps decline in the yield earned on loans , including loans held-for-sale . the increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $421 . 6 million , or 51 . 8% , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 , as well as an increase in the cost of funds relating to interest-bearing deposits of 17 bps . the increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to a 17 bps increase in the cost of certificates and brokered deposits as new certificates of deposits production in the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 was predominately in longer duration products with higher costs of funds . interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense due to a $44 . 3 million , or 34 . 4% , increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 , as well as an increase of 30 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds . the increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds was primarily due to the company s issuance of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter 2015 as well as the increase in the average balance of federal home loan bank advances compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . nim was 2 . 51% for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 compared to 2 . 85% for the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the decline in nim for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 was driven primarily by an increase of 18 bps in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as well as a decline of 7 bps in the yield earned on loans , including loans held-for-sale , partially offset by an increase of 21 bps in the yield earned on the securities portfolio . noninterest income the following table presents noninterest income for the five most recent quarters and the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . during the third quarter 2016 , noninterest income was $4 . 9 million , representing an increase of $2 . 5 million , or 106 . 3% , compared to $2 . 4 million for the third quarter 2015 . the increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase of $2 . 3 million , or 112 . 0% , in mortgage banking activities resulting primarily from increases in mortgage originations and sales as well as higher gain on sale margins . during the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 , noninterest income was $11 . 2 million , representing an increase of $3 . 2 million , or 39 . 9% , compared to $8 . 0 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase of $2 . 8 million , or 38 . 9% , in mortgage banking activities resulting primarily from higher origination volumes and an improvement in gain on sale margin , as well as a $0 . 2 million increase from the gain on sale of securities . 34 noninterest expense the following table presents noninterest expense for the five most recent quarters and the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . noninterest expense for the third quarter 2016 was $8 . 4 million , compared to $6 . 2 million for the third quarter 2015 . the increase of $2 . 2 million , or 35 . 5% , compared to the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $1 . 1 million in salaries and employee benefits , an increase of $0 . 4 million in consulting and professional services , an increase of $0 . 3 million in premises and equipment and an increase of $0 . 3 million in deposit insurance premium . the increase in salaries and employee benefits resulted from personnel growth and higher incentive compensation related to increased mortgage production . the increase in consulting and professional fees was due to higher legal fees incurred in the normal course of business commensurate with the company s growth and certain consulting projects that occurred during the third quarter 2016 . the increase in premises and equipment was due to expenses associated with the company s new headquarters location . the increase in deposit insurance premium was due to the new methodology implemented by the fdic as of july 1 , 2016 , which places a heavier weighting on year-over-year asset growth used to determine the cost of fdic deposit insurance . noninterest expense for the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 was $23 . 3 million , compared to $18 . 8 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase of $4 . 5 million , or 24 . 0% , compared to the nine months ended september 30 , 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $2 . 0 million in salaries and employee benefits , an increase of $0 . 7 million in premises and equipment , an increase of $0 . 7 million in consulting and professional services , an increase of $0 . 4 million in other expenses and an increase of $0 . 3 million in deposit insurance premium . the increase in salaries and employee benefits resulted primarily from personnel growth and higher incentive compensation related to increased mortgage production . the increase in premises and equipment was partially due to certain expenses associated with the company exiting its former headquarters location , as well as the company s build out of its corporate headquarters facility and further investments in technology . the increase in consulting and professional fees was due to higher legal fees incurred in the normal course of business commensurate with the company s growth and certain consulting projects that occurred during the 2016 period . the increase in other expenses were comprised of varying expenses , none of which were individually significant . the increase in deposit insurance premium was due to the new methodology implemented by the fdic as of july 1 , 2016 , which places a heavier weighting on year-over-year asset growth used to determine the cost of fdic deposit insurance . 35 financial condition the following table presents summary balance sheet data for the last five quarters . total assets were $1 . 8 billion at september 30 , 2016 , compared to $1 . 3 billion at december 31 , 2015 , representing an increase of $554 . 3 million , or 43 . 7% . the increase in total assets was due primarily to increases of $257 . 3 million , or 120 . 4% , in securities available-for-sale , $245 . 1 million , or 25 . 7% , in loans and $42 . 7 million , or 169 . 7% , in cash and cash equivalents . loan portfolio analysis the following table provides a detailed listing of the company s loan portfolio for the last five quarters . total loans as of september 30 , 2016 were $1 . 2 billion , increasing $245 . 1 million , or 25 . 7% , compared to $953 . 9 million as of december 31 , 2015 . total commercial loans increased $211 . 0 million , or 36 . 2% , as of september 30 , 2016 , compared to december 31 , 2015 , due to increases of $197 . 6 million , or 52 . 8% , in single tenant lease financing , $10 . 5 million , or 22 . 9% , in construction , $5 . 3 million , or 5 . 1% , in commercial and industrial and $1 . 1 million , or 2 . 4% , in owner-occupied commercial real estate . these increases were partially offset by a decline of $3 . 4 million , or 21 . 2% , in investor commercial real estate . 36 total consumer loans increased $35 . 7 million , or 9 . 8% , as of september 30 , 2016 , compared to december 31 , 2015 , due primarily to an increase of $54 . 8 million , or 50 . 6% , in other consumer loans . this increase was partially offset by decreases of $13 . 7 million , or 6 . 4% , in residential mortgages and $5 . 4 million , or 12 . 5% , in home equity loans . asset quality nonperforming loans are comprised of nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days past due and accruing . nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans , other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets , which consist of repossessed assets . the following table provides a detailed listing of the company s nonperforming assets for the last five quarters . troubled debt restructurings the following table provides a summary of troubled debt restructurings for the last five quarters . 37 the increase of $1 . 0 million , or 21 . 0% , in total nonperforming assets as of september 30 , 2016 compared to december 31 , 2015 was due primarily to an increase in nonaccrual loans . total nonperforming loans increased $1 . 0 million , or 578 . 4% , to $1 . 1 million as of september 30 , 2016 compared to $0 . 2 million as of december 31 , 2015 . this increase was primarily driven by two residential mortgage loans totaling $1 . 0 million that were placed on nonaccrual status during 2016 . as a result , the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans increased to 0 . 09% as of september 30 , 2016 compared to 0 . 02% as of december 31 , 2015 . the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to 0 . 31% as of september 30 , 2016 compared to 0 . 37% as of december 31 , 2015 due to the increase in total assets outpacing the increase in total nonperforming assets . as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 , the company had one commercial property in other real estate owned with a carrying value of $4 . 5 million . this property consists of two buildings which are residential units adjacent to a university campus . improvements to the property have been made in collaboration with the university and the property continues to be occupied . as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 , the company also had residential mortgage other real estate owned of less than $0 . 1 million and $0 , respectively . allowance for loan losses the following table provides a rollforward of the allowance for loan losses for the last five quarters and the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . the allowance for loan losses was $10 . 6 million as of september 30 , 2016 , compared to $8 . 4 million as of december 31 , 2015 . the increase of $2 . 2 million , or 26 . 5% , was due primarily to the growth in commercial and other consumer loan balances . during the third quarter 2016 , the company recorded net charge-offs of $1 . 7 million , compared to net recoveries of $0 . 1 million during the third quarter 2015 . during the nine months ended september 30 , 2016 , the company recorded net charge-offs of $1 . 9 million , compared to net recoveries of $0 . 7 million during nine months ended september 30 , 2015 . the increase in net charge-offs for both the third quarter 2016 and nine months ended september 30 , 2016 was due to the company charging off the full balance of a commercial and industrial loan it placed on nonaccrual status during the second quarter 2016 . the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans remained stable at 0 . 88% as of september 30 , 2016 , compared to 0 . 88% as of december 31 , 2015 . due primarily to the increase in nonaccrual loans , the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased to 932 . 1% as of september 30 , 2016 , compared to 5 , 000 . 6% as of december 31 , 2015 . 38 investment securities the following tables present the amortized cost and approximate fair value of our investment portfolio by security type for the last five quarters . the approximate fair value of investment securities available-for-sale increased $257 . 3 million , or 120 . 4% , to $471 . 0 million as of september 30 , 2016 compared to $213 . 7 million as of december 31 , 2015 . during the nine month period ended september 30 , 2016 , the company deployed funds generated through deposit growth to purchase additional securities to further diversify the securities portfolio and enhance net interest income while supporting liquidity and interest rate risk management . the increase was due primarily to increases of $133 . 0 million in mortgage-backed securities , $76 . 0 million in municipal securities and $48 . 2 million in u . s . government-sponsored agencies . during the third quarter 2016 , the company purchased $5 . 5 million in corporate securities with the intention to hold these securities to maturity . at september 30 , 2016 , the company had purchased $2 . 2 million of securities available-for-sale that had not settled . this obligation is recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet . 39 deposits the following table presents the composition of the company s deposit base for the last five quarters . total deposits increased $537 . 5 million , or 56 . 2% , to $1 . 5 billion as of september 30 , 2016 as compared to $956 . 1 million as of december 31 , 2015 . this increase was due primarily to increases of $499 . 9 million , or 106 . 2% , in certificates of deposits , $22 . 8 million , or 6 . 7% , in money market accounts , $9 . 2 million , or 39 . 0% , in noninterest-bearing deposits , $4 . 9 million , or 21 . 3% , in regular savings accounts and $0 . 7 million , or 0 . 8% , in interest-bearing demand deposits . the increase in the balance of certificates of deposits during the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to the company s concentrated efforts to capitalize on customer demand for longer duration deposit products and to enhance liquidity and asset/liability management . recent common stock offerings in may 2016 , the company and the bank entered into a sales agency agreement with sandler o neill partners , l . p . ( the agent ) to sell shares ( the atm shares ) of the company s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25 . 0 million , from time to time , through an at-the-market equity offering program ( the atm program ) . the sales , if any , of the atm shares , may be made in sales deemed to be at-the-market offerings as defined in rule 415 under the securities act of 1933 , as amended , including sales made directly on or through the nasdaq stock market , or another market for the company s common stock , sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange or otherwise , in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices , or as otherwise agreed with the agent . subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agency agreement , upon its acceptance of written instructions from the company , the agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell on the company s behalf all of the designated atm shares . the sales agency agreement provides for the company to pay the agent a commission of up to 3 . 0% of the gross sales price per share sold through it as sales agent under the sales agency agreement . the company may also sell atm shares under the sales agency agreement to the agent , as principal for its own account , at a price per share agreed upon at the time of sale . actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the company from time to time . the company has no obligation to sell any of the atm shares under the sales agency agreement , and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the sales agency agreement . in addition , the company has agreed to indemnify the agent against certain liabilities on customary terms . the company did not sell any shares through the atm program during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . the company has sold a total of 139 , 811 atm shares through the atm program for gross proceeds of approximately $3 . 4 million . as of september 30 , 2016 , approximately $21 . 6 million remained available for sale under the atm program . in may 2016 , the company separately entered into an underwriting agreement with the agent , pursuant to which the company sold an additional 895 , 955 shares of common stock at $24 . 00 per share , resulting in gross proceeds to the company of $21 . 5 million . the net proceeds to the company from the above offerings after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses was $22 . 8 million . debt offerings in october 2015 , the company entered into a term loan in the principal amount of $10 . 0 million , evidenced by a term note due 2025 ( the 2025 note ) . the 2025 note bears a fixed interest rate of 6 . 4375% per year , payable quarterly , and is scheduled to mature on october 1 , 2025 . the 2025 note represents an unsecured subordinated obligation of the company and may be repaid , without penalty , on any interest payment date on or after october 15 , 2020 . the 2025 note is intended to qualify as tier 2 capital under regulatory guidelines . 40 in september 2016 , the company issued $25 . 0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 . 0% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2026 ( the 2026 notes ) in a public offering . the 2026 notes initially bear a fixed interest rate of 6 . 00% per year to , but excluding september 30 , 2021 , and thereafter at a floating rate equal to the then-current three-month libor rate plus 485 basis points . all interest on the 2026 notes is payable quarterly . the 2026 notes are scheduled to mature on september 30 , 2026 . the 2026 notes are unsecured subordinated obligations of the company and may be repaid , without penalty , on any interest payment date on or after september 30 , 2021 . the 2026 notes are intended to qualify as tier 2 capital under regulatory guidelines . subsequent to the end of the quarter , the 2026 notes commenced trading on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol inbkl . capital the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies . capital adequacy guidelines and , additionally for banks , prompt corrective action regulations , involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices . capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components , risk weighting and other factors . the basel iii capital rules became effective for the company and the bank on january 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions . quantitative measures established by the basel iii capital rules to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios of common equity tier 1 capital , tier 1 capital and total capital , as defined in the regulations , to risk-weighted assets , and of tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets ( leverage ratio ) . when fully phased in on january 1 , 2019 , the basel iii capital rules will require the company and the bank to maintain : 1 ) a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4 . 5% , plus a 2 . 5% capital conservation buffer ( resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 7 . 0% upon full implementation ) ; 2 ) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6 . 0% , plus the capital conservation buffer ( resulting in a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 8 . 5% upon full implementation ) ; 3 ) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8 . 0% , plus the capital conservation buffer ( resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10 . 5% upon full implementation ) ; and 4 ) a minimum leverage ratio of 4 . 0% . the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1 , 2016 at the 0 . 625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period increasing by increments of that amount on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 2 . 5% on january 1 , 2019 . the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress . failure to maintain the minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio plus the capital conservation buffer will result in potential restrictions on a banking institution s ability to pay dividends , repurchase stock and/or pay discretionary compensation to its employees . the following tables present actual and required capital ratios as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 for the company and the bank under the basel iii capital rules . the minimum required capital amounts presented include the minimum required capital levels as of september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 based on the phase-in provisions of the basel iii capital rules and the minimum required capital levels as of january 1 , 2019 when the basel iii capital rules have been fully phased-in . capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations , as amended to reflect the changes under the basel iii capital rules . 41 42 shareholders dividends the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend for the third quarter 2016 of $0 . 06 per share of common stock payable october 17 , 2016 to shareholders of record as of september 30 , 2016 . the company expects to continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis ; however , the declaration and amount of any future cash dividends will be subject to the sole discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors , including its results of operations , financial condition , capital requirements , regulatory and contractual restrictions ( including with respect to the company s outstanding subordinated debt ) , business strategy and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors . as of september 30 , 2016 , the company had $38 . 0 million principal amount of subordinated debt outstanding pursuant to the 2021 debenture , the 2025 note , and the 2026 notes . the agreements under which subordinated debt was issued prohibit the company from paying any dividends on its common stock or making any other distributions to shareholders at any time when there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under the applicable agreement . if an event of default were to occur and the company did not cure it , the company would be prohibited from paying any dividends or making any other distributions to shareholders or from redeeming or repurchasing any common stock . capital resources while the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months , including any cash dividends it may pay , the company intends to continue pursuing its growth strategy , which may require additional capital . if the company is unable to secure such capital at favorable terms , its ability to execute its growth strategy could be adversely affected . liquidity liquidity management is the process used by the company to manage the continuing flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost while also maintaining safe and sound operations . liquidity , represented by cash and investment securities , is a product of the company s operating , investing and financing activities . the primary sources of funds are deposits , principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities , maturing loans and investment securities , access to wholesale funding sources and collateralized borrowings . while scheduled payments and maturities of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds , deposit flows are greatly influenced by interest rates , general economic conditions and competition . therefore , the company supplements deposit growth and enhances interest rate risk management through borrowings , which are generally advances from the federal home loan bank . the company maintains cash and investment securities that qualify as liquid assets to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations and meet its financial commitments . at september 30 , 2016 , on a consolidated basis , the company had $539 . 1 million in cash and cash equivalents , interest-bearing time deposits and investment securities available-for-sale and $32 . 5 million in loans held-for-sale that were generally available for its cash needs . the company can also generate funds from wholesale funding sources and collateralized borrowings . at september 30 , 2016 , the bank had the ability to borrow an additional $324 . 5 million in advances from the federal home loan bank , the federal reserve and correspondent bank fed funds lines of credit . the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity . in addition to its operating expenses , the company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its common stockholders and interest and principal on outstanding debt . the company s primary sources of funds are cash maintained at the holding company level and dividends from the bank , the payment of which is subject to regulatory limits . at september 30 , 2016 , the company , on an unconsolidated basis , had $17 . 3 million in cash generally available for its cash needs , which is in excess of its current annual regular shareholder dividend and operating expenses . the company uses its sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing financial commitments , including withdrawals by depositors , credit commitments to borrowers , operating expenses and capital expenditures . at september 30 , 2016 , approved outstanding loan commitments , including unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit , amounted to $129 . 6 million . certificates of deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less at september 30 , 2016 totaled $401 . 3 million . generally , the company believes that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with the bank . management is not aware of any other events or regulatory requirements that , if implemented , are likely to have a material effect on either the company s or the bank s liquidity . 43 reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures this management s discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with u . s . generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) . non-gaap financial measures , specifically tangible common equity , tangible assets , average tangible common equity , tangible book value per common share , return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio are used by the company s management to measure the strength of its capital and its ability to generate earnings on tangible capital invested by its shareholders . although the company believes these non-gaap measures provide a greater understanding of its business , they should not be considered a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with gaap , nor are they necessarily comparable to non-gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies . reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included in the following table for the past five quarters and nine months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 . critical accounting policies and estimates there have been no material changes in the company s critical accounting policies or estimates from those disclosed in its annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31 , 2015 . 44 recent accounting pronouncements refer to note 12 of the condensed consolidated financial statements . off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business , the company enters into financial transactions to extend credit and forms of commitments that may be considered off-balance sheet arrangements . the company enters into forward contracts related to its mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to customers and from its mortgage loans held-for-sale . at september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2015 , the company had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $115 . 7 million and $42 . 7 million , respectively . these contracts mature in less than one year . the company does not believe that off-balance sheet arrangements have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition , changes in financial condition , revenues or expenses , results of operations , liquidity , capital expenditures or capital resources . item 3 . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates , foreign exchange rates and equity prices . the primary source of market risk for the company is interest rate risk . interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and the value of the company s equity resulting from changes in market interest rates and arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there are timing and volume differences between the amount of interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid , withdrawn , re-priced or mature in specified periods . the company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and equity while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates . the company monitors its interest rate risk position using income simulation models and economic value of equity ( eve ) sensitivity analysis that capture both short-term and long-term interest rate risk exposure . income simulation involves forecasting net interest income ( nii ) under a variety of interest rate scenarios . the company uses eve sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in interest rates on long-term cash flows , income and capital . eve is calculated by discounting the cash flows for all balance sheet instruments under different interest-rate scenarios . modeling the sensitivity of nii and eve to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on the assumptions incorporated into the modeling process . the company continually reviews and refines the assumptions used in its interest rate risk modeling . presented below is the estimated impact on the company s nii and eve position as of september 30 , 2016 , assuming parallel shifts in interest rates : 1 because certain current interest rates are at or below 1 . 00% , the 100 basis point downward shock assumes that certain corresponding interest rates approach an implied floor that , in effect , reflects a decrease of less than the full 100 basis point downward shock . the company s objective is to manage the balance sheet with a bias toward asset sensitivity while simultaneously balancing the potential earnings impact of this strategy . a risk-neutral position refers to the absence of a strong bias toward either asset or liability sensitivity . an asset sensitive position refers to when the characteristics of the balance sheet are expected to generate higher net interest income when interest rates , primarily short-term rates , increase as rates earned on interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly or in greater quantities than rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities would reprice . a liability sensitive position refers to when the characteristics of the balance sheet are expected to generate lower net interest income when short-term interest rates increase as rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly or in greater quantities than rates earned on interest-earning assets . 45 item 4 . controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information it is required to disclose in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 , as amended ( the exchange act ) , is recorded , processed , summarized , and reported within the time period specified in sec rules and forms . these controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management , including the principal executive and principal financial officers , as appropriate , to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure . in designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures , the company has recognized that any controls and procedures , no matter how well designed and operated , can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives . management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures . the company performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management , including the principal executive and principal financial officers , to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures under the exchange act . based on that evaluation , the principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 , 2016 . changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in the company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 that has materially affected , or is reasonably likely to materially affect , its internal control over financial reporting . 46 part ii item 1 . legal proceedings the company is not party to any material legal proceedings . from time to time , the bank is a party to legal actions arising from its normal business activities . item 1a . risk factors other than set forth below , there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in part i , item 1a , of the company s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31 , 2015 . we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt . our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest , or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our debt or to refinance our debt , will depend on our future performance of our operating subsidiaries . prevailing economic conditions (

thousands , except share and per share amounts ) ( unaudited ) 1 . description of business phibro animal health corporation ( phibro or pahc ) and its subsidiaries ( collectively , the company ) is a diversified global developer , manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of animal health and mineral nutrition products for food animals including poultry , swine , cattle , dairy and aquaculture . the company is also a manufacturer and marketer of performance products for use in the personal care , automotive , industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries . unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise , references in this report to we , our , us , and similar expressions refer to phibro and its subsidiaries . the unaudited consolidated financial information for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , is presented on the same basis as the financial statements included in the company s annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2016 ( the annual report ) , filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 29 , 2016 ( file no . 001-36410 ) . in the opinion of management , these financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of financial position , results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods , and the adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature . the financial results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year . the consolidated balance sheet information as of june 30 , 2016 , was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements , which include the accounts of phibro and its consolidated subsidiaries , but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ( gaap ) . the unaudited consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the annual report . the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of phibro and its consolidated subsidiaries . the decision whether or not to consolidate an entity requires consideration of majority voting interests , as well as effective control over the entity . intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements . 2 . summary of significant accounting policies and new accounting standards our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report . as of september 30 , 2016 , there have been no material changes to any of the significant accounting policies contained therein , except for the application of accounting standards update ( asu ) 2015-03 , interest imputation of interest ( subtopic 835-30 ) , during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this guidance . for further discussion , see new accounting standards . revisions of previously issued financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 , the company determined that amortization expense related to product-related intangible assets should be recorded in cost of goods sold rather than in selling , general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of operations . the company has revised its financial statements for the three months ended september 30 , 2015 , to correct the classification of amortization expense to increase cost of goods sold and reduce gross profit and selling , general and administrative expenses by $953 . these revisions had no impact on the company s previously reported net income ( loss ) or cash flows . the company evaluated the impact of the revisions on prior periods , assessing materiality quantitatively and qualitatively , and concluded the errors were not material to any previously issued financial statements . net income per share and weighted average shares basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period . 7 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period after giving effect to potential dilutive common shares equivalents resulting from the assumed exercise of stock options . for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , all common share equivalents were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share . dividends we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0 . 10 per share , totaling $3 , 941 , during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , to holders of our class a common stock and class b common stock . new accounting standards financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) asu 2016-15 , statement of cash flows ( topic 230 ) : classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments , provides specific guidance for the classification of certain transactions within the statement of cash flows . the issues addressed by this guidance include , but are not limited to , debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs , contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims . this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 , 2017 . early application is permitted , as long as all provisions under the guidance are applied simultaneously . the provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective transition approach . we are evaluating the impact of adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements . asu 2016-02 , leases ( topic 842 ) , supersedes the current lease accounting guidance and requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities for both financing and operating leases on the balance sheet and requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding leasing arrangements . this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 , 2018 . we are evaluating the impact of adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements . asu 2015-12 , plan accounting ( topics 960 , 962 and 965 ) , modifies certain disclosure requirements and asset valuation measurements . we applied the provisions of this guidance during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , and it had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements . asu 2015-11 , inventory ( topic 330 ) , requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value ( nrv ) . nrv is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business , less reasonably predictable costs of completion , disposal , and transportation . the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 , 2016 , and interim periods within those years . we are evaluating the impact of adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements . asu 2015-05 , intangibles goodwill and other internal-use software ( subtopic 350-40 ) provides guidance regarding the treatment of cloud computing arrangements and if an arrangement includes a software license . we adopted this guidance during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , and it had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements . 8 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) asu 2015-03 , interest imputation of interest ( subtopic 835-30 ) , requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction of the related liability . these costs were previously included in other assets . debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements may continue to be recognized in other assets . we adopted this guidance during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , and applied the guidance retrospectively . debt issuance costs of $2 , 406 and $2 , 538 as of september 30 , 2016 , and june 30 , 2016 , respectively , have been presented as a reduction in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets . asu 2014-15 , disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern ( subtopic 205-40 ) , requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of the financial statements , and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances . management will need to consider relevant conditions that are known and reasonably knowable at the issuance date . substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date . under the new standard , the definition of substantial doubt incorporates a likelihood threshold of probable similar to the current use of that term in gaap for loss contingencies . asu 2014-15 will be effective for annual periods ending after december 15 , 2016 , and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter . we do not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . asu 2014-09 , revenue from contracts with customers ( topic 606 ) , establishes principles for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers . the underlying principle is to identify the performance obligations of a contract , allocate the revenue to each performance obligation and then to recognize revenue when the company satisfies a specific performance obligation of the contract . asu 2015-14 , deferral of the effective date , amended asu 2014-09 , resulting in a one-year deferral of the effective date . asu 2016-08 , principal versus agent considerations ; asu 2016-10 , identifying performance obligations and licensing ; and asu 2016-12 , narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients also amended asu 2014-09 . the amendments are effective concurrent with the effective date for asu 2014-09 for annual periods beginning after december 15 , 2017 , and interim periods within those years . we are evaluating the impact of adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements . 3 . statements of operations additional information 9 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 4 . balance sheets additional information goodwill balances did not change during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . we evaluate our investments in equity method investees for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment may be impaired . the assets underlying a $4 , 040 equity investment are currently idled ; we have concluded the investment is not currently impaired , based on expected future operating cash flows and/or disposal value . 5 . debt revolving credit facility and term b loan we have a revolving credit facility ( the revolver ) , where we can borrow up to $200 , 000 , subject to the terms of the agreement , and a term b loan ( the term b loan , and together with the revolver , the credit facilities ) . the revolver has applicable margins equal to 2 . 50% or 2 . 75% , in the case of libor loans and 1 . 50% or 1 . 75% , in the case of base rate loans ; the margins are based on the first lien net leverage ratio . the term b loan has applicable margins equal to 3 . 00% with regards to libor loans and 2 . 00% regarding base rate loans . the libor rate on the term b loan is subject to a floor of 1 . 00% . 10 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) the revolver requires , among other things , the maintenance of a maximum consolidated first lien net debt to consolidated ebitda leverage ratio , calculated on a trailing four quarter basis , and contains an acceleration clause should an event of default ( as defined in the agreement governing the credit facilities ) occur . as of september 30 , 2016 , we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities . as of september 30 , 2016 , we had $62 , 000 in borrowings under the revolver and had outstanding letters of credit of $14 , 242 leaving $123 , 758 available for borrowings and letters of credit under the revolver . we obtain letters of credit in connection with certain regulatory and insurance obligations , inventory purchases and other contractual obligations . the tenors of these letters of credit are all one year or less . the weighted-average interest rates for the revolver and term b loan were 3 . 26% and 4 . 00% , respectively , for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . long-term debt during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , we applied the provisions of asu 2015-03 , interest imputation of interest ( subtopic 835-30 ) . debt issuance costs of $2 , 406 and $2 , 538 as of september 30 , 2016 , and june 30 , 2016 , respectively , have been presented as a reduction in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets . 6 . related

ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . mr . bendheim has sole authority to vote shares of our stock owned by bfi co . , llc , an investment vehicle of the bendheim family . 7 . employee benefit plans the company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all domestic nonunion employees employed on or prior to december 31 , 2013 , who meet certain requirements of age , length of service and hours worked per year . plan benefits are based upon years of service and average compensation , as defined . in july 2016 , we amended our domestic noncontributory defined benefit pension plan to eliminate credit for future service and compensation increases , effective as of september 30 , 2016 . the amendment resulted in a curtailment of the pension plan . during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , we recorded a pension curtailment gain of $6 , 822 in other comprehensive income and an offsetting reduction in the liability for pension benefits included in other liabilities . we also modified the 401 ( k ) retirement savings plan , effective october 1 , 2016 , to include , for all domestic employees , a non-elective company contribution of 3% of compensation and an additional discretionary contribution of up to 4% of compensation , depending on the employee s age and years of service . separately , we recently offered a lump sum settlement option to certain pension plan participants . during the three months ending december 31 , 2016 , we will recognize a partial settlement of the pension plan and a charge to the consolidated statement of operations . the settlement expense is expected to be approximately $1 , 700 . 11 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) net periodic pension expense was : 8 .

are included within operating results . potential costs and expenses may also be incurred in connection with the repair or upgrade of facilities to meet existing or new requirements under environmental laws or to investigate or remediate potential or actual contamination and from time to time we establish reserves for such contemplated investigation and remediation costs . in many instances , the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the time period during which such costs are likely to be incurred are difficult to predict . while we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with environmental laws , we have , from time to time , received notices of violation from governmental authorities , and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations . additionally , at various sites , our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation , remediation and/or monitoring efforts to address contamination associated with historic operations of the sites . we devote considerable resources to complying with environmental laws and managing environmental liabilities . we have developed programs to identify requirements under , and maintain compliance with environmental laws ; however , we cannot predict with certainty the effect of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations , future capital expenditure requirements , or the cost of compliance . the nature of our current and former operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and we cannot assure we will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with such claims . based upon our experience to date , we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws , and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such environmental laws , will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position , results of operations , cash flows or liquidity . the united states environmental protection agency ( the epa ) is investigating and planning for the remediation of offsite contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the omega chemical corporation superfund site ( omega chemical site ) , which is upgradient of a facility in santa fe springs , california , operated by our subsidiary phibro-tech , inc . ( phibro-tech ) . the epa has named phibro-tech and certain other subsidiaries of pahc as potentially responsible parties ( prps ) due to groundwater contamination from phibro-tech s santa fe springs facility that has allegedly commingled with contaminated groundwater from the omega chemical site . in september 2012 , the epa notified 12 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) approximately 140 prps , including phibro-tech and the other subsidiaries , that they have been identified as potentially responsible for remedial action for the groundwater plume affected by the omega chemical site and for epa oversight and response costs . phibro-tech contends that groundwater contamination at its site is due to historical operations that pre-date phibro-tech and/or contaminated groundwater that has migrated from upgradient properties . in addition , a successor to a prior owner of the phibro-tech site has asserted that pahc and phibro-tech are obligated to provide indemnification for its potential liability and defense costs relating to the groundwater plume affected by the omega chemical site . phibro-tech has vigorously contested this position and has asserted that the successor to the prior owner is required to indemnify phibro-tech for its potential liability and defense costs . furthermore , a nearby property owner has filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california against many of the prps allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the omega chemical site ( including phibro-tech ) for alleged contamination of groundwater underneath its property , and a group of companies that sent chemicals to the omega chemical site for processing and recycling has filed a complaint under cercla , rcra and the common law public nuisance doctrine in the united states district court for the central district of california against many of the prps allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the omega chemical site ( including phibro-tech ) for contribution toward past and future costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the groundwater plume affected by the omega chemical site . due to the ongoing nature of the epa s investigation and phibro-tech s dispute with the prior owner s successor , at this time we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what , if any , liability phibro-tech or the other subsidiaries may ultimately have for investigation , remediation and the epa oversight and response costs associated with the affected groundwater plume . based upon information available , to the extent such costs can be estimated with reasonable certainty , we estimated the cost for further investigation and remediation of identified soil and groundwater problems at operating sites , closed sites and third-party sites , and closure costs for closed sites , to be $6 , 990 and $7 , 024 at september 30 , 2016 , and june 30 , 2016 , respectively , which is included in current and long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets . however , future events , such as new information , changes in existing environmental laws or their interpretation , and more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies , may give rise to additional expenditures or liabilities that could be material . for all purposes of the discussion under this caption and elsewhere in this report , it should be noted that we take and have taken the position that neither pahc nor any of our subsidiaries is liable for environmental or other claims made against one or more of our other subsidiaries or for which any of such other subsidiaries may ultimately be responsible . claims and litigation pahc and its subsidiaries are party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business including product liabilities , payment disputes and governmental regulation . certain of these actions seek damages in various amounts . in many cases , such claims are covered by insurance . we believe that none of the claims or pending lawsuits , either individually or in the aggregate , will have a material adverse effect on our financial position , results of operations , cash flows or liquidity . 9 . derivatives we monitor our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and use derivatives to manage certain of these risks . these derivatives generally have an expiration/maturity of two years or less and are intended to hedge cash flows related to the purchase of inventory . we designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge ) . we record the portion of the changes in the value of the derivative , related to a hedged asset or liability ( the effective portion ) , in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) . as the hedged item is sold , we recognize the gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) to the consolidated statements of operations on the same line where the hedged item is charged when released/sold . we immediately recognize in the consolidated statements of operations in the same line as the hedged item , the portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability ( the ineffective portion ) . 13 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) we routinely assess whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are effective . if we determine that a derivative ceases to be an effective hedge , we discontinue hedge accounting in the period of the assessment for that derivative , and immediately recognize any unrealized gains or losses related to the fair value of that derivative in the consolidated statements of operations . we record derivatives at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets . for additional details regarding fair value , see fair value measurements . the following table details the company s outstanding derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges as of september 30 , 2016 : the fair values at september 30 , 2016 , are unrealized and will fluctuate based on future exchange rates until the derivative contracts mature . other comprehensive income ( loss ) for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , included $34 of net unrecognized gains . accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) at september 30 , 2016 , included $2 , 689 of net unrecognized gains on derivative instruments ; we estimate that $167 of those gains will be recognized in earnings within the next twelve months . at june 30 , 2016 , realized losses of $1 , 528 , related to matured contracts were recorded as a component of inventory . we recognized $1 , 135 of these losses in cost of goods sold during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , and anticipate we will recognize the remaining $393 of these losses in costs of goods sold during the three months ending december 31 , 2016 . we recognize gains ( losses ) related to these derivative instruments as a component of cost of goods sold at the time the hedged item is sold . we hedge forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding twenty-four months . 10 . fair value measurements fair value is defined as the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability . fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability . financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using the three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements . the determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in the valuation as of the measurement date , notably the extent to which the inputs are market-based ( observable ) or internally derived ( unobservable ) . observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources . unobservable inputs are inputs based on a company s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances . the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows : level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities . level 2 significant observable inputs , other than quoted prices included within level 1 , that are observable for the asset or liability , either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data . level 3 unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available , and that are significant to the overall fair value measurement , are employed that require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions . in assessing the fair value of financial instruments at september 30 , 2016 , and june 30 , 2016 , we used a variety of methods and assumptions that were based on estimates of market conditions and risks existing at the time . 14 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) current assets and liabilities we consider the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities to be representative of their fair value because of the current nature of these items . letters of credit we obtain letters of credit in connection with certain regulatory and insurance obligations , inventory purchases and other contractual obligations . the carrying values of these letters of credit are considered to be representative of their fair values because of the nature of the instruments . the tenors of these letters of credit are all one year or less . long term debt we record the term b loan and the revolver at book value in our consolidated financial statements . we believe the carrying value of the term b loan is approximately equal to the fair value , which is based on quoted broker prices that are level 2 inputs . we believe the carrying value of the revolver is approximately equal to the fair value due to the variable nature of the instrument . deferred consideration on acquisitions we estimated the fair value of the deferred consideration on acquisitions using the income approach , based on the company s current sales forecast related to the acquired business . derivatives we determine the fair value of derivative instruments based upon pricing models using observable market inputs for these types of financial instruments , such as spot and forward currency translation rates . the table below provides a summary of the changes in the fair value of level 3 liabilities : 11 . business segments the animal health segment manufactures and markets a broad range of products for food animals , including poultry , swine , cattle , dairy and aquaculture . the business includes net sales of medicated feed additives and other related products , nutritional specialty products and vaccines . the mineral nutrition segment manufactures and markets a broad range of trace mineral products for food animals . the performance products segment manufactures and markets a variety of products for use in the personal care , automotive , industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries . we evaluate performance and allocate resources based on the animal health , mineral nutrition and performance products segments . certain of our costs and assets are not directly attributable to these segments and such costs are referred to as corporate . we do not allocate such items to the principal segments because they are not used to evaluate their operating results or financial position . 15 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) we evaluate performance of our segments based on adjusted ebitda . we define adjusted ebitda as income before income taxes plus ( a ) interest expense , net , ( b ) depreciation and amortization , ( c ) ( income ) loss from , and disposal of , discontinued operations , ( d ) other expense or less other income , as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations , including foreign currency gains and losses and loss on extinguishment of debt , and ( e ) certain items that we consider to be unusual , non-operational or non-recurring . the accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included herein . 16 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) the animal health segment includes all goodwill of the company . the animal health segment includes advances to and investment in an equity method investee of $4 , 040 and $4 , 076 as of september 30 , 2016 , and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . the performance products segment includes an investment in an equity method investee of $428 and $504 as of september 30 , 2016 , and june 30 , 2016 , respectively . corporate assets include cash and cash equivalents , debt issuance costs related to the revolver , income tax related assets and certain other assets . 17 table of contents item 2 . management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md a ) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance and summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results , financial condition , liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below . this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q . our future results could differ materially from our historical performance or our future expectations as a result of various factors , such as those discussed in forward-looking statements and risk factors . overview of our business phibro animal health corporation is a diversified global developer , manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of animal health and mineral nutrition products for food animals including poultry , swine , cattle , dairy and aquaculture . we also are a manufacturer and marketer of performance products for use in the personal care , automotive , industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries . trends and uncertainties our business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry . some in the public perceive risks to human health related to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize certain of our products , including certain of our medicated feed additives products . in particular , there is increased focus , primarily in the united states , on the use of medically important antibacterials , as defined by the fda . medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health and are listed in the appendix of the fda-cvm guidance for industry ( gfi ) #152 . our products that contain virginiamycin , oxytetracycline or neomycin have previously been classified by the fda as medically important antibacterials . this may lead to a decline in the demand for and production of food products derived from animals that utilize our products and , in turn , demand for our products . livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of nutrition and health-related concerns , animal rights , and other concerns . any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries , including us . in addition , campaigns by interest groups , activists and others with respect to perceived risks associated with the use of our products in animals , including position statements by livestock producers and their customers based on non-use of certain medicated products in livestock production , whether or not scientifically-supported , could affect public perceptions and reduce the use of our products . those adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in animals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations . our sales in the united states of products classified by the fda as medically important antibacterials were approximately $33 million for the twelve months ended september 30 , 2016 . our business is subject to product registration and authorization regulations . changes in these regulations could have a material impact on our business . in april 2016 , the fda began initial steps to withdraw approval of mecadox ( carbadox ) , due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in tissues for longer than previously determined . this initial action by the fda does not prohibit the sale or use of mecadox in the united states . mecadox has been approved and sold in the united states for more than 40 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial diseases including salmonella and swine dysentery . mecadox is not used in human medicine and the class of drug is not considered a medically important antimicrobial . the approved mecadox label requires a 42-day withdrawal period pre-harvesting , and to date we have not seen any hazardous residues of carbadox being detected from pig meat treated in accordance with the approved label . we have complete confidence in the safety of mecadox . in response to fda inquiries several years ago , we began rigorous new studies of the continued safety of the product when used in accordance with the label . our studies were completed in july 2016 , and we submitted our data , analyses and information to the fda that we believe support the continued safe use of mecadox . as of september 30 , 2016 , we await the response of the fda as the timing of their response to our submission is not subject to a predetermined deadline . should we be unable to successfully defend the 18 table of contents safety of the product , the loss of mecadox sales would have a negative impact to the results of our operations . our sales of mecadox in the united states were approximately $14 million for the twelve months ended september 30 , 2016 , a decrease of $1 million compared with the twelve months ended june 30 , 2016 , as a result of normal variation in customer order patterns . analysis of the consolidated statements of operations summary results of operations certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments . * calculation not meaningful 19 table of contents net sales , adjusted ebitda and reconciliation of gaap net income to adjusted ebitda we report net sales and adjusted ebitda by segment to understand the operating performance of each segment . this enables us to monitor changes in net sales , costs and other actionable operating metrics at the segment level . see general description of non-gaap financial measures for descriptions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda . segment net sales and adjusted ebitda : ( 1 ) reflects ratio to total net sales * calculation not meaningful the table below sets forth a reconciliation of net income , as reported under gaap , to adjusted ebitda : 20 table of contents amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments . * calculation not meaningful comparison of three months ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 net sales net sales of $188 . 0 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , increased $0 . 9 million , or less than 1% , as compared to the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . animal health grew $4 . 4 million , while mineral nutrition and performance products declined $2 . 9 million and $0 . 6 million , respectively . animal health net sales of $124 . 5 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , grew $4 . 4 million , or 4% . the growth was primarily due to volume increases in the nutritional specialty and vaccine product groups within the segment . nutritional specialty products grew $3 . 9 million , or 18% , primarily due to u . s . volume growth of our products for the dairy and poultry industries . vaccines grew $2 . 5 million , or 21% , principally from volume growth , including products acquired from mvp laboratories , inc . in january 2016 . medicated feed additives ( mfas ) and other declined $2 . 1 million , or 2% , primarily due to domestic volume declines resulting from adverse views regarding medically important antibacterials , partially offset by domestic growth in other products . international net sales declined slightly due to economic conditions in brazil , partially offset by growth in other regions . mineral nutrition net sales of $51 . 6 million decreased $2 . 9 million , or 5% , for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . stable volumes from demand for trace mineral products were offset by lower average selling prices due to underlying raw material commodity price declines . performance products net sales of $11 . 9 million decreased $0 . 6 million , or 5% , for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , due to lower average selling prices of personal care ingredients and lower volumes of copper-based products and chemical catalyst products . higher average selling prices of copper-based products partially offset the declines . gross profit gross profit of $61 . 0 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , increased $1 . 8 million , or 3% , as compared to the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . gross profit increased to 32 . 4% of net sales for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , as compared to 31 . 6% for the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . animal health gross profit increased $0 . 5 million due to volume growth in nutritional specialty and vaccine products , as well as lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies . current year animal health gross profit was reduced by $0 . 3 million of increased acquisition-related intangible amortization and $0 . 7 million of increased depreciation expense due to recent capital expenditures . mineral nutrition gross profit increased $0 . 7 million due to lower material costs , partially offset by lower average selling prices . performance products gross profit increased $0 . 5 million due to higher volumes of personal care ingredients and higher average selling prices of copper-based products , partially offset by lower average selling prices of personal care ingredients . selling , general and administrative expenses selling , general and administrative ( sg a ) expenses of $39 . 2 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , increased $1 . 8 million , or 5% , as compared to the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . 21 table of contents during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , we incurred $1 . 3 million in acquisition-related transaction costs for professional fees and other items in the evaluation and negotiation of an unsuccessful acquisition . excluding these costs , sg a used in calculating adjusted ebitda increased $0 . 6 million , or 2% . animal health accounted for $0 . 4 million of the increase , driven by increased sales force and development costs . mineral nutrition sg a decreased $0 . 2 million due to one-time costs in the prior year . corporate expenses accounted for $0 . 4 million of the increase due to increased compensation and benefit costs . interest expense , net interest expense , net of $3 . 9 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , increased $0 . 1 million , or 2% , compared to the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . interest expense increased $0 . 7 million due to increased borrowings under our revolver , compared to the same three-month period last year , and increased acquisition-related accrued interest . interest income increased $0 . 6 million from interest on deposits in foreign jurisdictions . foreign currency ( gains ) losses , net foreign currency ( gains ) losses , net for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , amounted to net losses of $0 . 3 million , as compared to $5 . 5 million in net gains for the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . foreign currency losses in the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , were primarily due to the movement of brazil and israel currencies relative to the u . s . dollar . foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances . provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was $5 . 4 million and $4 . 7 million for the three months ending september 30 , 2016 , and september 30 , 2015 , respectively . the effective income tax rates for these periods were 30 . 7% and 20 . 2% , respectively . the increase of 10 . 5% during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , was primarily due to the benefit of a valuation allowance during the three months ended september 30 , 2015 , which offset the majority of our domestic income tax provision . in addition , we recognized an income tax benefit related to certain discrete items during the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . excluding the benefits of the prior year valuation allowance and discrete items , the effective income tax rate for the three months ended september 30 , 2015 , was approximately 33% . our effective tax rate may be impacted due to the effects of various discrete items , the fluctuation in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions , as well as the amount of income earned in our foreign subsidiaries , some of which may have significant net operating loss carryforwards . as of september 30 , 2016 , we maintained a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to our foreign net operating loss carryforwards . we review the realizability of our deferred tax assets and evaluate our valuation allowances on a quarterly basis , or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required . we will continue to evaluate the necessity of these foreign valuation allowances in future periods , and to the extent that a positive earnings trend continues , a significant portion of these allowances may be released in future periods . net income net income of $12 . 2 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , decreased $6 . 6 million , compared to net income of $18 . 8 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . the decrease was a result of the factors described above , including a $5 . 8 million decline in foreign currency ( gains ) losses , net and a $0 . 7 million increase in income tax expense . adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of $29 . 8 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , increased $2 . 1 million , or 8% , as compared to the three months ended september 30 , 2015 . animal health adjusted ebitda increased $1 . 1 million , or 4% , due to sales growth and increased gross profit , partially offset by 22 table of contents increased sg a expenses . mineral nutrition increased $0 . 8 million , or 26% , due to improved operating margins from lower material costs , partially offset by lower average selling prices . performance products increased $0 . 7 million , due to higher volumes and lower product costs , partially offset by lower average selling prices . corporate expenses increased $0 . 5 million due to increased compensation and benefit costs . pension plan and retirement savings plan changes in july 2016 , we amended our domestic noncontributory defined benefit pension plan to eliminate credit for future service and compensation increases , effective as of september 30 , 2016 . the amendment resulted in a curtailment of the pension plan . during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , we recorded a pension curtailment gain of $6 . 8 million in other comprehensive income and an offsetting reduction in the liability for pension benefits included in other liabilities . we also modified the 401 ( k ) retirement savings plan , effective october 1 , 2016 , to include , for all domestic employees , a non-elective company contribution of 3% of compensation and an additional discretionary contribution of up to 4% of compensation , depending on the employee s age and years of service . separately , we recently offered a lump sum settlement option to certain pension plan participants . during the three months ending december 31 , 2016 , we will recognize a partial settlement of the pension plan and a charge to the consolidated statement of operations . the settlement expense is expected to be approximately $1 . 7 million . analysis of financial condition , liquidity and capital resources net increase ( decrease ) in cash and cash equivalents was : net cash provided ( used ) by operating activities was comprised of : certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments . operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $21 . 5 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , primarily attributable to operating income of $21 . 8 million , partially offset by changes 23 table of contents in operating assets and liabilities of $0 . 9 million . accounts receivable provided $3 . 9 million due to timing of sales and collections . decreased inventories provided $4 . 5 million of cash due to timing of purchases and production . accounts payable and accrued expenses used $6 . 4 million of cash primarily due to timing of purchases , payments for annual incentive compensation and retirement plan funding . investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $5 . 9 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . capital expenditures were $5 . 9 million as we continued to invest in our existing asset base and for capacity expansion and productivity improvements . financing activities net cash used by financing activities was $11 . 7 million for the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . net repayments on our revolver used $7 . 0 million . we paid $3 . 9 million in dividends to holders of our class a and class b common stock . we paid $0 . 7 million in scheduled debt and other requirements . liquidity and capital resources we believe our cash on hand and our financing arrangements , including the availability of borrowings under the revolver , will be sufficient to support our future cash needs . our operating plan projects adequate liquidity throughout the year . however , we can provide no assurance that our liquidity and capital resources will be adequate for future funding requirements . we believe we will be able to comply with the terms of the covenants under the revolver based on our operating plan . in the event of adverse operating results and/or violation of covenants under the facilities , there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments . other risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions and macroeconomic , business and financial disruptions that could arise . there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing . in addition , our debt covenants may restrict our ability to invest . certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources were : we define working capital as total current assets ( excluding cash and cash equivalents ) less total current liabilities ( excluding current portion of long-term debt ) . we calculate the ratio of current assets to current liabilities based on this definition . at september 30 , 2016 , our cash and cash equivalents included $37 . 0 million held by our international subsidiaries . there are no restrictions on cash distributions to pahc from our international subsidiaries . at september 30 , 2016 , we had $62 . 0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolver . we had outstanding letters of credit and other commitments of $14 . 2 million , leaving $123 . 8 million available for borrowings and letters of credit . we currently intend to pay quarterly dividends of $0 . 10 per share , representing $15 . 8 million annually on our class a and class b common stock , subject to approval from the board of directors . we declared and paid a cash dividend of $0 . 10 per share on class a common stock and class b common stock during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 . on november 7 , 2016 , our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0 . 10 per share on each share of our class a and class b common stock outstanding on the record date of november 30 , 2016 , payable on december 21 , 2016 . 24 table of contents contractual obligations as of september 30 , 2016 , there were no material changes in payments due under contractual obligations from those disclosed in the annual report . off-balance sheet arrangements we do not currently use off-balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement , hedging transactions , investment or other financial purposes . in the ordinary course of business , we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise . these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental matters . if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification , we would be required to reimburse the loss . these indemnifications generally are subject to certain restrictions and limitations . general description of non-gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is an alternative view of performance used by management as our primary operating measure , and we believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure . we report adjusted ebitda to portray the results of our operations prior to considering certain income statement elements . we have defined ebitda as net income ( loss ) plus ( i ) interest expense , net , ( ii ) provision for income taxes or less benefit for income taxes , and ( iii ) depreciation and amortization . we have defined adjusted ebitda as ebitda plus ( a ) ( income ) loss from , and disposal of , discontinued operations , ( b ) other expense or less other income , as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations , including foreign currency gains and losses and loss on extinguishment of debt , and ( c ) certain items that we consider to be unusual , non-operational or non-recurring . the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda and adjusted ebitda is net income ( loss ) . the adjusted ebitda measure is not , and should not be viewed as , a substitute for gaap reported net income ( loss ) . the adjusted ebitda measure is an important internal measurement for us . we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics . the following are examples of how our adjusted ebitda measure is utilized : senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted ebitda basis ; our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted ebitda basis ; and other goal setting and performance measurements are prepared on an adjusted ebitda basis . despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement , adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and , therefore , has limits in its usefulness to investors . because of its non-standardized definition , adjusted ebitda , unlike gaap net income , may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies . adjusted ebitda is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance . we also recognize that , as an internal measure of performance , the adjusted ebitda measure has limitations , and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric . a limitation of the adjusted ebitda measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period , such as the depreciation of property , plant and equipment or amortization of purchased intangibles , and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies . certain significant items adjusted ebitda is calculated prior to considering certain items . we evaluate such items on an individual basis . such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual or non-operational nature . unusual , in this context , may represent items that are not part of our ongoing 25 table of contents business ; items that , either as a result of their nature or size , we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis . we consider foreign currency gains and losses to be non-operational because they arise principally from intercompany transactions and are largely non-cash in nature . new accounting standards for discussion of new accounting standards , see notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies and new accounting standards . critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult , subjective or complex judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods . not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult , subjective or complex judgments or estimates . however , management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america . significant estimates include depreciation and amortization periods of long-lived and intangible assets , recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill , realizability of deferred income tax and value-added tax assets , legal and environmental matters and actuarial assumptions related to our pension plans . these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements . estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period they are determined to be necessary . actual results could differ from those estimates . our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report . except as described below , as of september 30 , 2016 , there have been no material changes to any of the critical accounting policies contained therein . during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , we applied accounting standards update ( asu ) 2015-03 , interest imputation of interest ( subtopic 835-30 ) . all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this guidance , which requires that certain debt issuance costs be classified as a reduction of the related liability . debt issuance costs were previously classified as an asset . forward-looking statements this report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties . all statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this report are forward-looking statements . forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition , results of operations , plans , objectives , future performance and business . you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts . these statements may include words such as aim , anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , outlook , potential , project , projection , plan , intend , seek , believe , may , could , would , will , should , can , can have , likely , the negatives thereof and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events . for example , all statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings , revenues , costs , expenditures , cash flows , growth rates and financial results , our plans and objectives for future operations , growth or initiatives , strategies , or the expected outcome or impact of pending or threatened litigation are forward-looking statements . all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected . examples of such risks and uncertainties include : perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of those products ; restrictions on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals may become more prevalent ; a material portion of our sales and gross profits are generated by antibacterials and other related products ; 26 table of contents competition in each of our markets from a number of large and small companies , some of which have greater financial , research and development , production and other resources than we have ; the impact of current and future laws and regulatory changes ; outbreaks of animal diseases could significantly reduce demand for our products ; our ability to successfully implement several of our strategic initiatives ; the effect of weather conditions and the availability of natural resources ; the continuing trend toward consolidation of certain customer groups as well as the emergence of large buying groups ; our ability to control costs and expenses ; any unforeseen material loss or casualty ; exposure relating to rising costs and reduced customer income ; competition deriving from advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies ; unanticipated safety or efficacy concerns ; our dependence on suppliers having current regulatory approvals ; our raw materials are subject to price fluctuations and their availability can be limited ; natural and man-made disasters , including but not limited to fire , snow and ice storms , flood , hail , hurricanes and earthquakes ; terrorist attacks , particularly attacks on or within markets in which we operate ; our reliance on the continued operation of our manufacturing facilities and application of our intellectual property ; adverse u . s . and international economic market conditions , including currency fluctuations ; the risks of product liability claims , legal proceedings and general litigation expenses ; our dependence on our israeli and brazilian operations ; our substantial level of indebtedness and related debt-service obligations ; restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt agreements ; the risk of work stoppages ; and other factors as described in risk factors in item 1a . of the annual report . while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable , we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors , and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results . important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations , or cautionary statements , are disclosed under risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report . all forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements . you should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of these risks and uncertainties . we caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you . in addition , we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or , even if substantially realized , that they will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the way we expect . the forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof . we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any 27 table of contents forward-looking statement as a result of new information , future events or otherwise , except as otherwise required by law . if we do update one or more forward-looking statements , no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements . item 3 . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations , we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates , foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices . as a result , future earnings , cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty . we use , from time to time , foreign currency contracts as a means of hedging exposure to foreign currency risks . we also utilize , on a limited basis , certain commodity derivatives , primarily on copper used in manufacturing processes , to hedge the cost of anticipated purchase or supply requirements . we do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes . we do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings , cash flows and fair values . we monitor the financial stability and credit standing of our major counterparties . for financial market risks related to changes in interest rates , foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices , reference is made to the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk section in the annual report and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included therein . there were no material changes in the company s financial market risks from the risks disclosed in the annual report . item 4 . controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company s management , including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer , of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures ( as defined in rules 13a-15 ( e ) and 15d-15 ( e ) under the securities exchange act of 1934 ( the exchange act ) ) . based upon that evaluation as of september 30 , 2016 , our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded that , as of the end of such period , our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting , as described in management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item 9a . controls and procedures in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended june 30 , 2016 . management s remediation plan management has begun implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses that existed as of june 30 , 2016 . our remediation plan includes ( i ) designing and implementing additional formal accounting policies and procedures and ( ii ) restricting access to key financial systems and records to appropriate users to ensure that appropriate segregation of duties is maintained . recent actions taken to address material weaknesses include the design and implementation of certain formal accounting policies and procedures , as well as restricting certain access to users of key financial systems and records . we will continue to build on the progress we have made in our remediation plan . we cannot determine when our remediation plan will be fully completed , and we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts . changes in internal control over financial reporting there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended september 30 , 2016 , that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect , our internal control over financial reporting . 28 table of contents part ii other information item 1 . legal proceedings information required
